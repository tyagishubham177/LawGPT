18 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations of it. By itself, it is not enforceable in a Court of Law, yet it states objects and aids legal interpretation of the Constitution, where language is ambiguous...construction which fits the preamble may be preferred (However, the preamble cannot override the express provisions of an Act). Am endm ent of Pream ble In Berubarif ’ case (AIR 1960 SC 858), held that Preamble is not a part of Constitution. However'i'in Keshavanand’s case (AIR 1973 SC 1467) held that it is part of Constitution and Conititution should be read and interpreted in the light of grand and noble vision expressed in Preamble. In fact, the Preamble was relied on in imposing implied limitations on amendment under Art. 368. Held that since Preamble is part of Constitution, it can be amended, but ‘basic features' in it can’t be amended. Amending power can’t change the Constitution in such a way that it ceases to be a ‘Sovereign Democratic Republic'. 3. FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES AND FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES [A] Fundamental Rights Part HI of the Constitution, which contains fundamental rights, has been described as the Magna Carta of India. These fundamental rights substantially covers all the traditional civil and political rights enumerated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Dr. Ambedkar described them as “the most criticized part” of the Constitution. Gajendragadkar, J. described them as the “very foundation and cornerstone of the democratic way of life ushered in this country by the Constitution”. Fundamental rights, subject to the provisions of the Constitution, cannot be violated or interfered with by any law, order, or Act of the government. Fundamental rights were deemed essential to protect the rights and liberties of the people against the encroachment of the power delegated by them to their government. They are limitations upon all the powers of the government. In Maneka Gandhi case, Bhagwati, J. observed: “These fundamental rights represent the basic values cherished by the people of this country since the Vedic times and they are calculated to protect the dignity of the individual and create conditions in which every human being can develop his personality to the fullest extent. They weave a ‘pattern of guarantee’ on the basic structure of human rights, and impose negative obligations on the State not to encroach on individual liberty in its various dimensions.” These rights are regarded as fundamental because they are most essential for the attainment by the individual of his full intellectual, moral and spiritual status. The object behind the inclusion of them in the Constitution is to establish ‘a government of law and not of man’. The object is to establish rule of law. These are available against State and not against private individuals. In A.K. Gopalan v State o f Madras (AIR 1950 SC 27), Mukherjee, J., observed: "There cannot be any such thing as absolute and uncontrolled liberty wholly freed from Constitution/Constitutional Law 19 restraint, for that would lead to anarchy and disorder. The possession and enjoyment of all rights are subject to such reasonable conditions as may be deemed by the governing authority essential to the safety, health, peace, general order and morals of the community. Whdt the Constitution therefore attempts to do by declaring the rights of the people is to strike a balance between individual liberty and social control.” The Constitution also provides for the ‘suspension’ of fundamental rights in certain circumstances. Art. 358 provides that when the President under Art. 352 makes the proclamation of emergency, the freedoms guaranteed by Art. 19 are automatically suspended for the period of emergency. Art. 359 further empowers the President to suspend the right to move any court for the enforcement of fundamental rights (except Arts. 20 and 21) during the continuance of emergency. ' It is now an established proposition that an individual cannot waive any of his Fundamental Rights. This proposition has been applied in a number of cases. “The State cannot arrogate to itself a right to commit breach of the Fundamental Rights of any person by resorting to principles of waiver or estoppel or other similar principles.” The fundamental rights can be classified under the following six groups: (a) Right to equality (Articles 14-18). (b) Right to freedom (Articles 19-22). (c) Right against exploitation (Articles 23-24). (d) Right to freedom of religion (Articles 25-28). (e) Cultural and educational rights (Articles 29-30). (f) Right to Constitutional remedies (Articles 32-35): The 44th Amendment has abolished the ‘right to property’ as a fundamental right guaranteed by Art. 19(1) (f) and Art. 31 of the Constitution, ft is now only a legal right. ARflCLE 12: Definition of State “Unless the context otherwise requires, the term 'State' include the following - executive and legislature o f Union and States; dll local or other authorities within territory o f India or under the control o f government." In the context of Art. 12, ‘authority’’ means the power to make laws, byelaws, etc., which have the force of law and power to enforce those laws. The expression ‘other authorities’ in Art. 12 is used after mentioning the executive and legislature of Union and States, and all local authorities (viz. Municipalities, Panchayats). The ejusdem generis rule, however, could not be resorted to in interpreting this expression, as there isr no common genus running through these named bodies (in Art. 12), nor can these bodies so placed in one single category on any rational basis. In Electricity Board, Rajasthan and Sukhdev Singh v Bhagatram cases, the Supreme Court field that only the authorities created by the Constitution or Statute are the ‘other authorities’, though it is not necessary that statutory authority* should be engaged ifi performing governmental functions. Thus, Rajasthan Electricity Board, Co-operative society, ONGC, LIC, etc. are held to be ‘other authorities’.
----------------------------------------
Thus, Rajasthan Electricity Board, Co-operative society, 
ONGC, LIC, etc. are held to be ‘other authorities’. But in subsequent decisions, a broad and liberal interpretation to the expression ‘other authorities’ was given in view of the 20 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations fact that in a welfare State, a government has to employ various agencies or instrtimentalities (which are not created by statute). ■ , In R.D. Shelly v International Airport Authority o f India (AIR 1979 SC 1628), the Irifemational Airport Authority held to be ‘the State’. The court laid down the following tests: (i) State mainly or chiefly contributed to the financial resources. (ii) Deep and pervasive State control e.g. appointment and removal of members ' of a society, etc. (iii) Functions of corporation are of public importance i.e. governmental in , essence. (iv) If a government department is transferred to a corporation. (v) Corporation enjoys monopoly status which is State-conferred. Applying this test in Som Prakash v Union o f India, the court held that a government company (Bharat Petroleum Corporation) is ‘State’. The expression ‘other authorities’ is not confined only to statutory corporation alone, but may include a government company, a registered society, or bodies which have some nexus with the government. The emphasis is on ‘functionality plus State control’ rather than the statutory character of the corporation. In Ajay Hasia case, held that a registered society is an agency or instrumentality of the State. Thus, held that the Regional Engineering College established and administered by a registered society is a ‘State’. In Unni Krishnan v State o f A.P. (1993) 1 SCC 645, the court observed that the term ‘authority’ may cover any other person or body performing ‘public duty’. Thus, a private medical/engineering college comes within the writ jurisdiction of the court irrespective of the question of aid and affiliation. In Tekraj Vasandi case, held that the ‘Institute of Constitutional and Parliamentary Studies’ is not a ‘State’. Similarly, in Chandra Mohan Khanna case, held that N.C.E.R.T. is not a ‘State’ as the governmental control is confined only to proper utilization of the grant. In S.M. Ilyas v ICAR [1993 (1 SCC 182)], held that the Indian Council of Agricultural Research is a ‘State’. In recent cases, held that Hindustan Steel Works Construction Ltd. is not a State; Steel Authority o f India Ltd. is a State; BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) is not a State. In M.C. Mehta v Union o f India (1987) 1SCC 395, the question was whether a private corporation (Shriram Food and Fertilizers Ltd.) is a “State” under Art. 12. The court observed that a non-governmental company can be placed within the meaning of Art. 12, if for reasons of State control and regulations and kind of public function they are performing, they satisfy the tests of instrumentality or agency of government. In Indian Council for Enviro-Legal Action v UOI (1996) 3 SCC 463, held that if by the action of the private corporate bodies a person’s fundamental right is violated the Court would not accept the argument that it is not ‘State’ within the meaning of Art. 12. In Pradeep Kumar Biswas v Indian Institute o f Chemical Biology (2002) 5 SCC 1, the Supreme Court by a 5:2 majority held that CSIR (Council of Scientific and Industrial Research) is an instrumentality of the State within the meaning of Art. 12 of the Constitution of India. It overruled the decision in Sabhajit Tewari case (1975). The majority held that even though it was formed under the Registration of Societies Act, I860, but it is a ‘State’ because the government had overriding control over the organization. The object Constitution/Constitutional Law 21 incorporated in Memorandum of Association of CSIR “manifestly demonstrates that CSIR was set up in the national interest to further the economic welfare of the society by fostering planned development in the country. The Government of India has a dominant role in the governing body of the CSIR. The court observed: “The Constitution has to an extent defined the word “State” in Art. 12 itself as including “the Government under the control of the Government of India”. That an “inclusive” definition is generally not exhaustive is a statement of the obvious and as far as Art. 12 is concerned, has been so held by the Supreme Court. The words “State” and “authority” used in Art. 12 therefore remain among “the great generalities of the Constitution” the content of which has been and continues to be supplied by courts from time to time. Keeping pace with the broad approach to the concept of equality under Arts. 14 and 16, courts have whenever possible, sought to curb an arbitrary exercise of power against individuals by “centres of power”, and there was correspondingly an expansion in the judicial definition of “State” in Art. 12.” In Virendra Kumar Srivastava v U.P. Rajya Karmchari Kalyan Nigam (2005) 1 SCC 149, the Apex Court explained the majority and minority opinions laid down in Predeep Kumar Biswas case. It observed: The multiple test which is to be applied to ascertain the character of a body as falling within Art. 12 or outside as laid down by the majority view in the aforesaid case is to ascertain the nature of financial, functional and administrative control of the State over it and whether it is dominated by the State Government and the control can be said to be so deep and pervasive as described in the minority view so as to satisfy the court “of brooding presence of the Government” on the activities of the Corporation. In G Bassi Reddy v International Crops Research Institute (AIR 2003 SC 1764), the International Crops Research Institute was not held to be a ‘State’ within the meaning of Art. 12. The court opined that it is an international organization and has been set up as non-profit research and training centre to help developing countries to alleviate rural poverty and hunger.
----------------------------------------
In G Bassi Reddy v International Crops Research Institute (AIR 2003 SC 1764), 
the International Crops Research Institute was not held to be a ‘State’ within the meaning 
of Art. 12. The court opined that it is an international organization and has been set up 
as non-profit research and training centre to help developing countries to alleviate rural 
poverty and hunger. It is not set up by the Government, and is not controlled by nor is accountable to the Government. In Rupa Ashok Hurra v Ashok Hurra (AIR 2002 SC 1771), the Apex Court has re­ affirmed and ruled that no judicial proceeding could be said to violate any of the fundamental rights. It was said to be settled position of law that the superior courts of justice did not fall within the ambit of ‘State’ or ‘other authorities’ under Art. 12. In Zee Telefilms Ltd. v Union o f India (2005) 4 SCC 649, the Apex Court applied the tests laid down in Pradeep Kumar Biswas (2002) 5 SCC 111, to determine whether a body is State: (i) Principles laid down in A jay Hasia (1981) 1 SCC 722 are not a rigid set of principles so that if a body falls within any of them it must ex hypothesis be considered to be a State within the meaning of Art. 12. (ii) The question in each case will have to be considered on the basis of facts available as to whether in the light of the cumulative facts as established, the body is financially, functionally, administratively dominated, by or under the control of the Government, (iii) Such control must be particular to the body in question and must be pervasive, (iv) Mere regulatory control whether under statute or otherwise would not serve to make a body a part of the State. In the present case, the BCC1 (Board of Control for Cricket in India) was not found by the court (majority opinion) to be ‘State’. 22 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations The court observed: In Art. 12 the term “other authorities” was introduced at the time of framing of the Constitution with a limited objective of granting judicial review of actions of such authorities which are created under statute and which discharge State functions. However, because of the need of the day the Supreme Court in Rajasthan SEB (1967) 3 SCR 377 and Sukhdev Singh (1975) 1 SCC 421, noticing the socio-economic policy of the country thought it fit to expand the definition of the term “other authorities” to include bodies other than statutory authorities. This development of law by judicial interpretation culminated in the judgment of the seven-judge Bench in Pradeep Kumar Biswas case. It is to be noted that in the meantime the socio-economic policy of the country has changed and the State is today distancing itself from commercial activities and concentrating on governance rather than on business. Hence, there seems to be no need to further expand the scope of “other authorities” in Art. 12 by judicial interpretation at least for the time being. Is Judiciary Included In the word ‘State’? The judiciary, though not expressly mentioned in Art. 12, it should be included so, since courts are set up by statute and exercise power conferred by law. In Naresh v State o f Maharashtra (AIR 1967 SC 1), it was held that even if a court is the State a writ under Art. 32 cannot be issued to a High Court of competent jurisdiction against its judicial orders, because such orders cannot be said to violate the fundamental rights. What the judicial decision purports to do is to decide the controversy between the parties and nothing more. In view of the judgment in A.R. Antulay v R.S. Nayak (AIR 1988 SC 1531), where it was held that the court could not pass an order or issue a direction which would be violative of fundamental rights, it can be said that the expression ‘State’ includes judiciary also. ARTICLE 13: Laws Inconsistent with Fundamental Rights Clause (/) - All pre-Constitution or existing laws i.e. laws which were in force immediately before the commencement of the Constitution shall be void to the extent to which they are inconsistent with fundamental rights from the date of the commencement of Constitution. Clause (2) - The State shalln’t make any law which takes away or abridges the fundamental rights, and any law in contravention of fundamental rights shall to the extent of contravention, be void. Clause (3) - It gives the term ‘law’ a very broad connotation which includes any ordinance, order, byelaw, rule, regulation, notification, custom or usage having the force of law. Art. 13, in fact, provides for the ‘judicial review’ of all legislations in India, past as well as future. Art. 13 is not applicable to law declared by the Supreme Court u/Arts. 141- 142 [Ashok Kumar Gupta v State ofU.P. (1997) 5 SCC 201], Application and Rules of Interpretation o f Art. 13 (1) No retrospective effect - Art. 13(1) is prospective in nature. All inconsistent existing laws become void only after the commencement of Constitution. They are not void ab initio. Such laws exist for all past acts, transactions, etc. and for enforcing all rights and liabilities accrued before the date of the Constitution. However, nobody can claim his rights and liabilities to be enforced under a Constitution/Constitutional Law 23 particular procedure (in respect of pending proceedings) which becomes inconsistent with fundamental rights. (2) Doctrine o f Severability or Separability - It means that if an offending provision can be separated from that which is constitutional then only that part which is offending is to be declared as void and not the entire statute. The primary test is whether what remains is so inextricably mixed with the part declared invalid that what remains cannot survive independently.
----------------------------------------
The primary test is whether what remains is so inextricably mixed with the part 
declared invalid that what remains cannot survive independently. In R.M.D.C. v Union o f India (AIR 1957 SC 628), the court observed that the intention of the legislature is a determining factor i.e. whether the legislature would have enacted the valid part if it had known that the rest of the statute was invalid. Severability is the question of substance and not of form. (3) Doctrine o f Eclipse - It is based on the principle that a law which violates fundamental rights is not nullity or void ab initio but becomes only unenforceable i.e. remains in a moribund condition. “It is over-shadowed or eclipsed by the fundamental rights, and remains dormant, but it is not dead.” Such laws exist for all past transactions, for rights and liabilities incurred before the __ Constitution came into force, and for the determination of rights of persons who haven’t been given fundamental rights by the Constitution e.g. non-citizens (Bhikaji v State o f MR AIR 1955 SC 781). Does the doctrine o f eclipse apply to a post-Constitution law - Art. 13(2) deals with post-Constitution or future laws [while clause (1) deals with pre-Constitution or existing laws]. It is to be noted that in both Cl. (I) and (2) of Art. 13, a declaration by the court of their invalidity will be necessary, to make the laws invalid. In Deep Chand v State ofU.P. (AIR 1959 SC 648) and Mahendra Lai Jain case (AIR 1963 SC 1019), held that the doctrine of eclipse applies only to pre-Constitution law, and not to post-Constitution law, because voidness of latter is from its very inception and such a law cannot exist for any purpose. But, in State o f Gujarat v Ambica Mills (AIR 1974 SC 1300), held that a post-Constitution law which is inconsistent with fundamental rights is not nullity or non-existent in all cases and for all purposes. It will be operative as regards to non-citizens, because fundamental rights are not available to them. In Dulare Lodh v Additional District Judge, Kanpur case (AIR 1984 SC 1260), the Court applied the doctrine of eclipse to post-Constitution law even against citizens. A ‘void’ statute can be revived by constitutional amendment. ARTICLE 14: Equality before Law Article 14 embodies the idea of equality expressed in the Preamble. The succeeding Articles 15, 16 and 17 lay down specific applications of the general rules laid down in Art. 14. Art. 14 reads: "The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection o f the laws within the territory o f India." While “equality before law ” is a somewhat negative concept implying the absence of any special privilege in favour of individuals and the equal subject of all classes to the ordinary law. “Equal protection o f law" is a more positive concept implying equality of treatment in equal circumstances. The rule is that like should be treated alike and not that 24 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations unlike should be treated alike. In State o f W.B. v Anwar Ali Sarkar, the Court rightly observed that the second expression is the corollary of the first and it is difficult to imaging a situation in which violation of equal protection of laws will not be the violation of the equality before law. Thus, in substance the two expressions mean one and the same thing The words “arty person" in Art. 14 denote that equal protection of law is available to any person which includes any company or association, etc. Art. 14 extends to both citizens and non-citizens and to natural persons as well as legal persons. The equality before law is guaranteed to all without regard to race, colour or nationality. Art. 14 app||es to both, the substantive as well as procedural law, as discrimination can occur in both. Exceptions to rule o f equality - Art. 361 provides that President and Governors shall not be answerable to any court for the exercise and performance of the powers and duties of office. Foreign Diplomats are immune from the jurisdiction of courts. Article 14 permits classification but prohibits class legislation - Art. 14 does not mean that the same laws should apply t< all persons or that every law must have universal application, for, all persons are not, by nature, attainmert or circumstances, in the same positions. Class legislation is that which makes an improper discrimination by conferring particular privileges upon a class of persons arbitrarily selected. While, Art. 14 forbids class legislation, it permits reasonable classifications of persons, objects and transactions by the legislature for the purpose of achieving specific ends. The classification must fulfill following two conditions: (a) it must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the group; and (b) the differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act. To illustrate by an example: Under Sec. 11 of Indian Contraci Act, persons who haven’t attained majority can’t enter into a contract. The two categories are adults and minors. The basis of classification is the age, which obviously has a relatisn to the capacity to enter into contract. The section, therefore, satisfies both requirements of a valid classification. Where a Special Act provides a summary/ speedier procedure (but harsher and more onerous than the ordinary civil procedure) for eviction of a person from unauthorized occupation of government premises, in N.L Caterer's case (AIR 1967 SC 1581), held that the Act is discriminatory. But, in M. Chagganlal v Greater Bombay Municipality (AIR 1974 SC 2009), it held that “government premises" is a sufficient guidance for authorities to take action under special procedure.
----------------------------------------
But, in M. Chagganlal v Greater Bombay Municipality (AIR 
1974 SC 2009), it held that “government premises" is a sufficient guidance for authorities 
to take action under special procedure. It laid down: (i) Where a statute providing for a more drastic procedure different from the ordinary procedure covers the whole field covered by the ordinary procedure, without any guidelines as to the class of cases in which either procedure is to be resorted to, the statute will be hit by Art. 14 (Anwar Ali case). (ii) However, if from the preamble and surrounding circumstances, as well as the provisions of statute themselves explained and amplified by affidavits, necessary guidelines could be inferre , the statute will not be hit by Art. 14 (Kathi Ranning v State ofSaurashtra AIR 1952 SC 123). Constitution/Constitutional Law 25 Various decisions have established important guidelines or principles which further clarify the “scope of permissible classification”: (1) A law may be constitutional even though it relates to a single individual if on account of some special circumstances that single individual may be treated as a class by itself. (2) There is always a presumption in favour o f the constitutionality of a statute. However, the presumption may be rebutted in certain cases by showing that there is no classification at all. (3) The classification made by a legislature need not be scientifically perfect or logically complete. Mathematical nicety and perfect equality are not required. Equal treatment does not mean identical treatment. (4) The question whether a classification is reasonable, and proper or not, must, however, be judged more on common sense than on legal subtleties. (5) The basis of classification may be different e.g. geographical, vocational, difference in time, difference in nature of persons, trade or occupation, etc. New Concept of Equality While the traditional concept of equality is based on the doctrine o f classification, the new concept is based on the doctrine o f arbitrariness. Art. 14 has rightly activist magnitude and it embodies a guarantee against arbitrariness. Arbitrariness is the very antithesis o f equality. In E.P. Royappa v State ofT.N. (AIR 1974 SC 555), held that equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be imprisoned within traditional and doctrinaire limits. In Maneka Gandhi case, the court observed that principle of reasonableness, which legally as well as philosophically, is an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness, pervades Art. 14 like a brooding omnipresence. In A.L. Kalra v Project & Equipment Corpn. (1984) SCC 999, the court said that for the application of Art. 14 one need not allege any discrimination vis-4-vis others. Arbitrary or unreasonable actions, according to court, are per se discriminatory. In Ajay Hasia case, held that allocation of one-third of total marks for interview was plainly arbitrary and violative of Art. 14. In Air India v Nargesh Meerza (AIR 1981 SC 1829), held that the termination of service on pregnancy was manifestly unreasonable and arbitrary and was, therefore, clearly violative of Art. 14. In Mithu v State o f Punjab (AIR 1983 SC 473), the court struck down Sec. 303,1.P.C. as unconstitutional. Sec. 303 prescribes that if a person under a life-sentence commits murder, he must be given death sentence. But under Sec. 302, if a person commits murder he may be awarded either death sentence or life-sentence. In BALCO Employees Union v UOI (AIR 2002 SC 350), the apex court held that there can be no judicial review of economic policy of the Government unless there is violation of the Constitution or any Act. The process of disinvestments is a policy decision involving complex economic factors. The petitioners have failed to prove that decision to disinvest in BALCO is any way capricious, arbitrary, illegal or uninformed. In Sarbanand Sonowal v UOI (AIR 2005 SC 3920), the validity of Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act, 1983 was in question. Held that the IMDT Act, which applied only to the State of Assam and not the other States similarly situated is discriminatory 26 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations as the classification based on ‘geographical basis’ contains provisions and prescribes such procedure that it virtually becomes impossible to detect and deport foreigners (illegal Bangladesh immigrants). Instead of achieving the object of detecting and deporting foreigners it defeats the purpose. For satisfying the test of Art. 14, the ‘geographical factor’ alone in making classification is not enough but there must be a nexus with the object sought to be achieved. In this case, it was also held that the fundamental right of a foreigner is confined to Art. 21 for life and liberty and does not include the right to reside and stay in this country, as mentioned in Art. 19(1 )(e), which is available only to a citizen of the country. The State reserves the right to expel them from its territory and to refuse to grant them certain rights which are enjoyed by its own nationals. In AIIMSStudents’ Union v AIIMS (AIR 2001 SC 3262), the Supreme Court while emphasizing “merit-based” selection, struck down the institutional reservation (i.e. for students of AIIMS) of 33% coupled with 50% reservation discipline-wise in the Institute’s post-graduate courses, as violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution.* p ie court observed: Any reservation, apart from being sustainable on the constitutional anvil, must also be reasonable to be permissible. Reservation other than constitutional reservation is subversion of fraternity, unity, integrity and dignity of individual. Institutional reservation is not supported by the Constitution. In Javed v State o f Haryana [JT 2003 (6) SC 283], the apex court upheld the constitutional validity of certain provisions of Haryana Panchayati Raj Act, 1994, which disqualified a person for holding office of Sarpanch or a Panch of a Gram Panchayat, etc. if he had more than two living children. The provision was held to be not discriminatory and the classification made by it (viz.
----------------------------------------
In Javed v State o f Haryana [JT 2003 (6) SC 283], the apex court upheld the 
constitutional validity of certain provisions of Haryana Panchayati Raj Act, 1994, which 
disqualified a person for holding office of Sarpanch or a Panch of a Gram Panchayat, etc. if he had more than two living children. The provision was held to be not discriminatory 
and the classification made by it (viz. persons having more than two children and persons having not more than two children) is based on intelligible differentia having nexus with the object of popularization of family planning programme. The provision also does not violate Art. 25 of the Constitution. In Danial Latift v Union o f India (2001) 7 SCC 740, the petitioners challenged the constitutional validity of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986, under which Sec. 125, Cr. P. C., providing for maintenance of wives (including divorced women) by their former husbands, was made inapplicable to divorced Muslim women. The Act was said to be violative of Arts. 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India. Upholding the Act, the apex court said that a careful reading of the provisions of the Act would indicate that a Muslim husband is liable to make reasonable and fair provision for the future of the divorced wife which obviously includes her maintenance as well. Even under the Act, the provisions of Sec. 125, Cr. P. C. would still be attracted. In John Vallamatton v UOI (AIR 2003 SC 2902), the Supreme Court held that Sec. 118 of the Indian Succession Act, 1926 is discriminatory and thus violative of Art. 14. The impugned provision places certain restrictions upon an Indian Christian to bequeath his property for religious or charitable purpose. In State o f Haryana v Jai Singh (AIR 2003 SC 1696), the Government of Haryana issued a Notification granting remission of prison sentence to all convicts except those excluded in the said Notification. The Supreme Court held that the offences excluded had been properly classified (based on the nature of offence), and, there is no violation of Art. 14. Likewise, in S. Satyanaryan v Government o f A.P. (AIR 2003 SC 3074), the court Constitution/Constitutional Law 27 upheld the classification to keep away convicts for crimes against women from the benefits of remission, as reasonable, proper and not violative of Art. 14. [Note: New development in equality also includes increased emphasis on positive equality or affirmative action by the State (Mandat case, St. Stephen College case)]. ARTICLE 15: Non-Discrimination on Grounds of Religion, Race, Caste, Sex or Place of Birth Article 15 provides for a particular application of the general principle embodied in Art. 14. Hence, if a discriminatoiy action does not fall within the purview of Art 15, it may yet be avoided if it is obnoxious to Art. 14. When a law comes within the prohibition of A rt 15 it cannot be validated by recourse to Art. 14 by applying the principle of reasonable classification. It may be noted that, unlike Art. 14, the guarantee under Art. 15 is available to citizens only. Clause (1) - “The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only o f religion, caste, sex, place o f birth or any o f them.'" The word ‘discrimination’ means ‘to make an adverse distinction with regard to’, ‘to distinguish unfavourably from others’. It must be noted that a discrimination based on any of these grounds and also on other grounds is not hit by Art. 15(1). Thus, a law which discriminates on the ground of residence does not violate Art. 15(1) (Place of birth is different from residence). Similarly, the requirement of a test in regional language for State employment doesn’t contravene Art. 15 as the test is made compulsory for all persons seeking employment. Clause (2) - “No citizen shall, on ground only o f religion, race, caste, sex, place o f birth or any o f them, be subject to any disability, liability, restriction or condition with regard to - (a) access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and places o f public entertainment; or (b) the use o f wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads and places o f public resort maintained wholly or partly out o f State funds or dedicated to the use o f general public.” (‘Places of public resort’ includes public parks, buses, railway, hospitals, etc.). It is to be noted that while clause (1) prohibits discrimination by State, clause (2) includes private persons also from making any discrimination. Provisos (or Exceptions) to Art. 15(1) and (2) Clause (3) - “Nothing in this article shall prevent State from making any special provision for women and children”. Thus, reservation of seats for women in a college does not offend against Art. 15(1). Clause (4) - “Nothing in this article or clause (2) o f Art. 29 shall prevent the State from making any special provision for advancement o f any socially and educationally backward classes o f citizen or for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes." The scope of Art. 15(4) was discussed in Balaji v State o f Mysore (AIR 1963 SC 649). The court observed that Art. 15(4) only enables the State to make special and not exclusive provisions for backward classes. Clause (4) is only an enabling provision and does not impose any obligation on the State to take any special action under it. It merely confers a discretion to act, if necessary. 28 Law Guide (or Competitive Examinations In State o f U.P. wPradeep Tandort (AIR 1975 SC 563), held that while reservation for candidates coming from rural areas was Unconstitutional, for those coming from the Hill and Uttarakhand areas was valid as these areas were instances of socially and educationally backward-class citizens.

Law Guide (or Competitive Examinations
In State o f U.P. wPradeep Tandort (AIR 1975 SC 563), held that while reservation 
for candidates coming from rural areas was Unconstitutional, for those coming from the 
Hill and Uttarakhand areas was valid as these areas were instances of socially and 
educationally backward-class citizens. In Dr. Priti Srivasta\’a v State o f M.P. (AIR 1999 SC 2894) held that lowering of the minimum qualifying marks for admission to “super­ specialty” post-graduate medical courses in favour of the reserved category candidates is unconstitutional and violative of Art. 15(4) of the Constitution. The Apex Court in State o f M.P. v GD. Ttrlhani (AIR 2003 SC 2952), emphasized on the need for a common entrance test and minimum qualifying marks for admission to post­ graduate course. Again, in Harish Verma v A jay Srivastava (AIR 2003 SC 3371), the court reiterated with approval the law laid down in Preeti Srivastava and GD. Tirthani and struck down admissions given to in-service candidates, to post-graduate medical course, who had secured marks less than the minimum prescribed by the Medical Council of India. In K.H. Siraj v High Court o f Kerala (AIR 2006 SC 2339), the appellants challenged the validity of Kerala Judicial Service Rules 14 and 15, fixing the minimum marks for interview for selection of Munsif Magistrate. The Supreme Court held that the Rules made by the Kerala High Court for the selection of judicial officers is valid. It also held that interview is the best method of assessing the suitability of a candidate. It brings out overall intellectual and personal qualities of candidates while written examination will testify the candidate’s academic knowledge. Clause (5) - The Constitution 93rd Amendment Act, 2005, has added a new Clause (5) to Art. 15. Cl. (5) provides that nothing in Art. 15 or in Art. I9(l)(g) prevent the State in making any special provision, by law, for the advancement o f socially and educationally backward classes o f citizens or for SCs/ STs in so far as such special provision relate to admission to educational institutions, including private ones, whether aided or unaided by the State, other than minority educational institutions referred to in Art. 30 (I). ARTICLE 16: Equality of Opportunity in Public Employment Under Art. 16, the guarantee against discrimination is limited to ‘employment and appointment’ under the State. Art. 15 is more general and deals with all cases of discrimination which do not fall under Art. 16. Clause (I) - There shall be equality o f opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to '’employment or appointment ’ to any office under the State. Clause (2) - No citizen shall, on grounds only o f religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place o f birth, residence or any o f them, be ineligible for, or discriminated against in respect o f any employment or office under the State. In State o f Kerala v N.M. Thomas (AIR 1976 SC 490), the Court observed: “The rule of equality within Art. 16(1) will not be violated by a measure which ensures equality of representation in the services for the unrepresented classes after satisfying the basic needs of efficiency of administration.” The members of the SC, STs and other backward classes can be given concessions, test exemptions and other employment preferences (not involving reservations), under Art. 16(1). In this case, a new interpretation of Art. 16(1) were made. The majority stated that Articles 14, 15 and 16 form part of a string of constitutionally guaranteed rights Constitution/Constitutional Law 29 supplementing each other. Art. 16 was explained as an incidence of guarantee of equality contained in Art. 14 and, therefore, permitted reasonable classification of employees in matters relating to employment or appointment. Exceptions to Clauses (1) and (2) Clause (3) - It empowers Parliament to make a law prescribing any requirement as to residence within that State or UT, prior to employment or appointment in that State or UT. Clause (4) - It empowers the State to make special provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward classes of citizens, which in the opinion of the State are not adequately represented in the services under the State. Clause (5) - Nothing in this Article shall affect the operation of any law, which provides that the incumbent of an office in connection with the affairs of any religions institution or any member of the governing body shall thereof shall be a person professing a particular religion. Article 16(4) applies only if two conditions are satisfied - (i) the class of citizens is backward i.e. socially and educationally, (ii) the said class is’not adequately represented in service of the State. The second test cannot be the sole criterion. Art. 16(4) must be interpreted in the light of Art. 335 which says that claims of SC and ST shall be taken into consideration constituently with the maintenance of efficiency of administration. However, the 82nd Amendment Act, 2000 restored the relaxation in qualifying marks and standards of evaluation in both, job reservation and promotions to SC/STs by adding a proviso to this effect in Art. 335. In State o f Kerala v N.M. Thomas case, held that Art. 16(4) indicated one of the methods of achieving equality embodied in Art. 16(1), and Art. 16(4) do not exhausts the equality of opportunity which can be made available to the backward classes. The guarantee of equality before law is something more than is required by formal equality, and Art. 16(1) means effective material or real equality. Thus, Art. 16(4) is not to be read by way of any exception to Art. 16(1). “Equality of opportunity admits discrimination with reason, which means rational classification for differential treatment having nexus to the constitutionally permissible object.” Protective discrimination is a facet of equality under Arts. 14, 15 and 16 (Jagdish Lai v State o f Haryana AIR 1997 SC 2366). Mandal Case The scope and extent of Art.
----------------------------------------
16(1) means effective material or real equality. Thus, Art. 16(4) is not to be read 
by way of any exception to Art. 16(1). “Equality of opportunity admits discrimination with 
reason, which means rational classification for differential treatment having nexus to the 
constitutionally permissible object.” Protective discrimination is a facet of equality under 
Arts. 14, 15 and 16 (Jagdish Lai v State o f Haryana AIR 1997 SC 2366). Mandal Case
The scope and extent of Art. 16(4) has been examined thoroughly by the Supreme Court in Indira Sawhney v Union o f India (“The Mandal Case”) (AIR 1993 SC 477). The Court by 6-3 majority upheld the decision of Union government to reserve 27% Government jobs for OBCs (Other Backward Classes) provided “creamy layer” among them are eliminated and reservation only confined to initial appointments and not promotions and the total reservation shall not exceed 50% (There is already a 2214% reservation for SC and STs in government jobs). However, the court struck down the government notification reserving 10% government jobs for economically backward classes among higher castes. The majority held that the Mandal Report is valid... however, no opinion is expressed by it. Also, held that a provision under Art. 16(4) can be made by ‘executive’ order. The majority opinion may be summarized as follows: (I) Backward class o f citizens in Art. 16(4) can be identified on the basis o f caste and not only on economic basis - A caste can be quite often is a social class in India and if 30 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations it is backward socially, it would be a backward class for the purpose of Art. 16(4). Though caste alone can’t be taken into consideration for purposes of identification of backward classes (occupation groups, classes and sections of people are other important criteria). (II) Art. 16(4) is not an exception to Art. 16(1), but an independent clause. Reservation can be made under Art. 16(1) on the basis o f reasonable classification - The court thus overruled Balaji case and approved Thomas case. Further, court said that Art. 16(4) is exhaustive of the subject of reservation in favour of backward classes, though it may not be exhaustive of very concept of reservation. Reservation for other classes can be made under Art. 16(1). (III) Backward classes in Art. 16(4) are not similar to as socially and educationally backward in Art. 15(4) - It is much wider and takes in SC/STs and OBCs including socially and educationally backward classes. (IV) Creamy layer (socially advanced persons) can be and must be excluded from Backward Classes - For excluding creamy layer, an economic criteria can be adopted as an indicium or measure of social advancement. (V) Art. 16(4) permits classification o f backward classes into backward and more backward classes. (VI) A backward class o f citizens cannot be identified only and exclusively with reference to economic criteria - Mainly social, and therefore educational and economic backwardness has to be taken into account. ~~ (VII) Reservation shall not exceed 50 percent - Art. 16(4) speaks of adequate representation and not the proportionate representation. Rule of 50% applicable to reservation proper only, not to exemptions, concessions or relaxations provided to backward classes. The court also held that ‘carry forward rule' (to carry forward the unfilled vacancies in the next year) is valid provided it shouldn’t result in breach of 50% rule. (VIII) No reservations in promotions - The court thus overruled A.B.S.K. Sangh Rly. case (AIR 1981 SC 298). The Supreme Court observed that the rule of reservation cannot be called anti-meritarian. It also observed that there are certain services where reservation should not be applied e.g. Professors, Pilots, Scientists, Technicians, Technical posts, Defence Services, etc. Comments: The determination of backwardness on the sole ground of caste has been criticised by Nani A. Palkhiwala, an eminent jurist, on the ground that it will revive casteism which the Constitution emphatically intended to end. The minority judgment of justices Thomas, Kuldip Singh and R.M. Sahai according to Palkhiwala state the correct law. They had held that casteism can never be the basis of reservations for employment under the Government. Other Cases Application of reservation to ‘Single isolated post’ will amount to 100 per cent reservation, which is not permissible [Post Graduate Institute o f Med. Ed. & Res. v Faculty Association, JT 1998(3) SC 223]. In E.V. Chinnaiah v State o f A. P. (2005) 1 SCC 394, it was held that it is not open to a State to sub-classify the Scheduled Castes and apportion the seats/quota already reserved for Scheduled Castes as a whole, amongst sub-classes of Scheduled Castes so Constitution/Constitutional Law 31 created. Such sub-classification or micro-classification would be violative of Art. 14 and of the doctrine of reasonableness. Except, to the extent the Constitution itself makes a sub-classification, there cannot be grouping of Scheduled Cates into different categories for differential treatment. The Constitution itself has kept the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes List out of interference by the State Governments. The court also noted: Reservation to a ‘backward class’ is not a constitutional mandate. It is the prerogative of the State concerned. Though the State can lay down a legislative policy as regards extent of reservation to be made for different members of the backward classes including Scheduled Castes, it cannot take away the said benefit on the premise that one or the other group amongst the members of the Scheduled Castes has advanced and thus, is not entitled to the entire benefit of reservation. In A.P.B.C. Sangh v Jharkhand State Vaishya Federation (AIR 2006 SC 2814), the appellants challenged the validity of the State Government order amalgamating ‘Extremely Backward Class’ and ‘Backward Class’ into one group for the purpose of reservation in professional and educational institutions as violative of Art. 14. It was held that the State Government’s decision to amalgamate the two classes is unreasonable as two different classes are treated similarly. Treating unequals as equals is violative of Art. 14.
----------------------------------------
In A.P.B.C. Sangh v Jharkhand State Vaishya Federation (AIR 2006 SC 2814), the 
appellants challenged the validity of the State Government order amalgamating ‘Extremely 
Backward Class’ and ‘Backward Class’ into one group for the purpose of reservation in 
professional and educational institutions as violative of Art. 14. It was held that the State 
Government’s decision to amalgamate the two classes is unreasonable as two different 
classes are treated similarly. Treating unequals as equals is violative of Art. 14. In the absence of new circumstances justifying the aforesaid amalgamation, the government’s decision is arbitrary and unreasonable. In Ashoka Kumar Thakur v UOI (2008) 6 SCC I, the reservation of 27% seats for OBCs in specified State-aided Central Universities under the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2006 was in issue. The Constitution (93rd Amendment) Act, 2005, by which Art. 15(5) was inserted in the Constitution, was basically challenged in these petitions on various grounds. The Act of 2007 was passed by the Parliament consequent upon the 93rd Amendment Act. The Constitution (93rd Amendment) Act, 2005, is challenged on many grounds, viz. if it is allowed to stand it would be against the “basic structure” of the Constitution itself and this Amendment seriously abridges the equality principles guaranteed under Art. 15 and other provisions of the Constitution; the ‘Golden Triangle’ of Arts. 14,19 and 21 is not to be altered and the balance and structure of these constitutional provisions has been ousted by the Amendment Act, 2005. It was contended that the Union Government has failed in performing the constitutional and legal duties towards the citizenry and its resultant effect. Consequentially the Act of 2007 shall have the effect and wide ramifications and ultimately it shall have the result in dividing the country on caste basis. The court observed: Reservation is one of the many tools that are used to preserve and promote the essence of equality, so that disadvantaged groups can be brought to the forefront of civil life. It is the duty of State to promote positive measures to remove barriers of inequality. To cope with the modem world and its complexities and turbulent problems, education is a must and it cannot remain cloistered for the benefit of a privileged few. Reservations provide that extra advantage to persons who, without such support, can forever dream of university education, without ever being able to realise it. This advantage is necessary. However, the fact remains that any reservation or preference shall not lead to ‘reverse discrimination.’ The Apex Court held: The Constitution (93rd Amendment) Act, 2005, does not violate the basic structure of the Constitution so far as it relates to State-maintained 32 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations institutions and aided educational institutions. Equality is a multi-coloured concept incapable of a single definition. The principles of equality cannot be completely taken away so as to leave citizens in a state of lawlessness. But the facets of the principles of equality can always be altered, especially to carry out the directive principles of State policy. If any constitutional amendment is made which moderately abridges the principle of equality, it cannot be said that it violates the basic structure of the Constitution. It has not been held in Keshavananda (1973) 4 SCC 225 that all facets of Art. 14 or any of the fundamental rights would form part of the basic structure. If any one of the provisions relating to a particular basic feature of the Constitution is altered or modified, that does not amount to the alteration of the basic structure. The court also held that Art. 15(5) is constitutionally valid and Arts. 15(4) and 15(5) are not mutually contradictory. But, in the case of Art. 15(5), the minority educational institutions (whether aided or unaided) are excluded from the purview of Art. 15(5). Further, classification of SEBCs cannot be done exclusively on the basis of caste as it would violate Art. 15(1). Poverty, social backwardness, economic backwardness, all are criteria for determination of backwardness. However, it is clear from Indr a Sawhney case that caste itself is not the final destination, that is, caste by itself cannot be determinative of social and educational backwardness, though caste can be the starting point for determination of backwardness. If 49.5% caste-based reservation was upheld in Indra Sawhney case for government employment, it follows that 49.5% caste-based reservation is permitted in aided educational institutions. Indra Sawhney case compels that conclusion that use of caste is valid. Hence, there is no choice but to uphold the impugned legislation by which the Government may still identify SEBCs, in part, by using caste. In Nair Service Society v Dr. T. Beermasthan (2009) 5 SCC 545, it was held: Reservation provisions are enabling provisions. The State is not bound to make a reservation but it is empowered to do so in its own discretion. Different State Governments in the country may have different methods for providing reservations, afid these will be valid as long as the method employed by a particular State Government does not violate any constitutional provision or statute. It is not for the Court to decide on the wisdom or otherwise of the method of reservation. Courts should exercise judicial restraint and not interfere with the same unless there is some clear illegality. In Subhash Chandra v Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board (2009) 15 SCC 458, it was held: There is a distinction between Art. 15(4) and Art. 16(4) of the Constitution. The words “Backward Classes” and “Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes” find place in Art. 15(4) but only the words “backward class of citizens” find place in Art. 16(4). The term “backward class of citizens” contained in Art. 16(4) includes Scheduled Castes/ Tribes for all intent and purport. Therefore, the protection sought to be accorded to a section of the citizenry must not only be to Backward Class but may also be to Scheduled Castes/Tribes for whom a special provision can be made. Indisputably, the classes contemplated by Art.
----------------------------------------
The words “Backward Classes” and “Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes” find place 
in Art. 15(4) but only the words “backward class of citizens” find place in Art. 16(4). The 
term “backward class of citizens” contained in Art. 16(4) includes Scheduled Castes/ 
Tribes for all intent and purport. Therefore, the protection sought to be accorded to a 
section of the citizenry must not only be to Backward Class but may also be to Scheduled 
Castes/Tribes for whom a special provision can be made. Indisputably, the classes 
contemplated by Art. 16(4) may be wider than those contemplated by Art. 15(4). If they are Backward Classes for the purpose of Arts. 16(1) and (4) and not Scheduled Castes/ Tribes, they will come within the purview of the reservation for Backward Classes and not the one which is exclusively meant for Scheduled Castes/Tribes within the purview of reservation policy of the State. Constitution/Constitutional Law 33 Creamy Layer In accordance with the direction given by the Supreme Court the Union Government appointed an expert committee known as Justice Ram Nandan Committee to identity the ‘Creamy Layer’ among the socially and educationally backward classes (SEBC). The Government of India has accepted the report. The report says that certain constitutional posts qualify for the rule of exclusion e.g. posts of President, Vice President, Judges of Supreme and High Courts, Chairman and, ■ members of UPSC and State PCS, Chief Election Commissioners, CAG, Governors, Ministers and Membership of Legislatures. The rule of exclusion covers class I officers of Central and State Services (direct recruits) public sector undertakings, armed forces, professional class including trade, business and industry and property owners. It excludes those having gross annual income of Rupee one lakh and above. The Supreme Court’s judgment, Ashok Kumar Thakur v State o f Bihar and Others (1995) 5 SCC 403 - reiterated that the ‘creamy layer’ among OBCs cannot quality for job reservations under its interpretation of the Mandal Commission recommendations. Reservation In Promotions The Constitution (77th Amendment) Act, 1995 - This amendment has been passed to remove the difficulty created by the Mandal case in which the court had held, that reservation could not be made to promotions in jobs. This amendment has added a new clause (4-A) to Art. 16 which provides that “Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any provision for reservations in the matters of promotion to any class or classes of posts in the services of the State in favour of SCs and STs which, in the opin'io'flj of the State, are not adequately represented in the services under the State.” This means'that the reservation in promotions in government jobs will continue in favour of SCs and STs. ‘Right to promotion’ is ordinarily a'statutory right. It is not a fundamental right. The right to promotion to a post/class of posts depends upon the operation1 o i the conditions of service. Article 16(4-A) read with Arts. 16(1) and 14 guarantees a rignt to promotion to SCs/ STs as a fundamental right where they do not have adequate representation consistently with the efficiency in administration [Ashok Kumar Gupta v State o f U.P. (1997)5 SCC 201], Eighty-fifth Amendment {2001): Amended Clause (4-A) of Art. 16 and substitutes for the words “in matter of promotion to any class” the words “in matters of promotion with consequential seniority, to any class”. It means that the promotion will be given to these classes with retrospective date i.e. 17th June 1995. It nullifies the decision in the Mandal case, wherein it was held that there can be no reservation in promotions. In M. Nagaraj v UOl (AIR 2007 SC 71), the petitioner invoked Art. 32 for a writ in % the nature of certiorari to quash the Constitution (85th Amendment) Act, 2001 inserting Art. 16 (4A) retrospectively from 17-6-1995 providing ‘reservation in promotion with consequential seniority’ for SCs and STs as being unconstitutional and violative of basic structure. The main issue concerned the “extent of reservation” (reservation within reservation). A five-judge Bench unanimously held that Clause (4A) of Art. 16 is an enabling provision. It applies only to SCs and STs. The said clause is carved out of Art. 16(4). Therefore, clause (4A) will be governed by the two compelling reasons 34 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations “backwardness” and “inadequacy of representation” as mentioned in Art. 16(4). If the said two reasons do not exist then the enabling provision cannot come into force. The State can make provision for reservation only if the above two circumstances exist. There is no violation of basic structure of the Constitution by the impugned legislation. Backlog Vacancies The Constitution {81st Amendment) Act, 2000 - This amendment has added a new clause (4- B) to Art. 16 which ends the 50% ceiling on reservation for SC/STs and OBCs in backlog vacancies which could not be filled due to the non-availability of eligible candidates of these classes in the previous year or years. The new clause provides that the unfilled vacancies would be treated as a separate class and would be filled in succeeding year or years and will not be considered together with vacancies of the year in which they are being filled up, even if the 50% limit imposed in the Mandal case is crossed. Marriage and Status of SC/ST In Sandhya Thakur v Vimla Devi Kushwah (2005) 2 SCC 731, it was held that the appellant, who by birth did not belong to a backward class or community, would not be entitled to contest a seat reserved for a backward class or community merely on the basis of her marriage to a male of that community. Also, in Meera Kanwaria v Sunita (AIR 2006 SC 597), it has been held that if a female of high caste Hindu marries a person belonging to Scheduled Caste she is not entitled to take the benefit of reservation under Arts. 15(4) and 16(4) of the Constitution.
----------------------------------------
Also, in Meera Kanwaria v Sunita (AIR 2006 
SC 597), it has been held that if a female of high caste Hindu marries a person belonging 
to Scheduled Caste she is not entitled to take the benefit of reservation under Arts. 15(4) 
and 16(4) of the Constitution. The court observed and held that a person who is a high caste Hindu and not subjected to any social or educational backwardness in her life, by reason of marriage alone cannot ipso facto become a member of SC/ST. In absence of any strict proof, she cannot be allowed to defeat the very provisions made by the State for reserving certain seats for disadvantaged people. In Sobha Hymavathi Devi v Setti Gangadhar Swamy (AIR 2005 SC 800), it was held that the reservation under Arts. 15(4) or 16(4) or 330 and 332 of the Constitution, would benefit only those who belong to a SC or ST and not those who claim to acquire the status by marriage. The appellant, in the present case, could not claim the right to contest 1 a seat reserved for a Scheduled Tribe in terms of Art, 332 merely by virtue of her marriage to a person belonging to a Scheduled Tribe. In M.C. Vais ala v State o f Kerala (AIR 2006 Ker 1), the issue was whether children bom out of inter-caste married couple could claim the status of SCs/STs for the benefit of reservation in admission to educational institutions and in public employment on the mere fact that one of their parents belonged to SCs /STs. It was observed and held that a particular community, caste, race or tribe or part of group thereof can be declared as SC or ST initially by the President of India and new groups can be added to the lists only by a Parliamentary legislation. The State Government cannot, by an executive' fiat, direct to treat any particular group of persons as SC or ST. There is no legislative competence for the State to do so in the light of Arts. 341 and 342. The caste of person depends on birth. It is, thus, obvious that the government cannot determine the caste of a particular person or class of persons. The burden is on the person who claims the benefit to establish that he/shc is subjected to the same hardship and disadvantages having been bom as a member of SC/ST. I Constitution/ConstitUtional Law 35 ARTICLE 17: Abolition of Untouchability Article 17 abolishes untouchability and forbids its practice in any form. Untouchability is neither defined in the Constitution nor in the Act. It refers to a social practice which looks down upon certain depressed classes solely on account of their birth and makes any discrimination against them on this ground. ‘ V* The Protection o f Civil Rights Act, 1955 [previously Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955] defines ‘Civil Right’ as ‘any right accruing to a person by reason of the abolition of untouchability by Art. 17 of the Constitution.’ The Act prescribes punishment (1-2 years imprisonment) for preventing any person from entering any place of public worship or from worshipping or denying access to any shop, public restaurants, hotels or places' of public entertainment or refusing to admit persons to hospitals and refusing to sell goods or render services to any person. Also, insulting a member of Scheduled Caste on the ground of untouchability or preaching untouchability or justifying it is a crime. Article 15(2) of the Constitution also helps in the eradication of untouchability. In PUDR v UOI (Asiad Project Workers' Case, AIR 1982 SC 1473) the Supreme Court held that the fundamental right under Art. 17 are available against “private individuals” and it is the constitutional duty of the State to take necessary steps to see that these rights are not violated. r». , ARTICLE 18: Abolition of Titles A democracy should not create titles and titular glories. This will go against the realization of social equality. Art. 18 abolishes all titles, k prohibits the State to confer titles on any body whether a citizen or a non-citizen. Military and academic distinctions are, however, exempted from the prohibition. Thus, a university can give title or honour on a man of merit. Clause (2) prohibits a citizen of India from accepting any title from any foreign State. Art. 18 is merely directory as there is no penalty prescribed for infringement of the prohibition. A 'title' (e.g. Sir, Nawab, Maharaja, etc.) means a title of honour, rank, function or office in which there is a distinctive appellation. The recent conferment of titles of “Bharat Ratna”, “Padma Vibhushan”, “Padma Shri”, etc. are spid to be not prohibited under Art. 18 as they merely denote State recognition of good work by citizens in the various fields of activity. In Balaji Raghavan v Union o f India, AIR 1996 SC 770), the Supreme Court upheld the validity of civilian honours but criticized the government for not exercising restraint in awarding these. ARTICLE 19: Right to Freedom Personal liberty is the most important of all fundamental rights. Articles 19-22 deal with different aspects of this basic right. Art. 19 guarantees to the citizens of India the following six fundamental freedoms'. (a) Freedom of Speech and Expression (b) Freedom of Assembly (c) Freedom to form Associations (d) Freedom of movement 36 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations (e) Freedom to reside and to settle (g) Freedom of profession, occupation, trade or business. The freedoms enumerated in Art. 19 (1) are those great and basic rights which are recognized as the natural rights inherent in the status of a citizen. But none of these freedoms is absolute or uncontrolled and may be restricted. A restriction to be constitutionally valid, must satisfy the following two tests: (i) The restriction must be for the purposes mentioned in clauses (2) to (6) of Art. 19. (ii) The restriction must be reasonable.
----------------------------------------
But none of these freedoms is 
absolute or uncontrolled and may be restricted. A restriction to be constitutionally valid, 
must satisfy the following two tests: (i) The restriction must be for the purposes mentioned 
in clauses (2) to (6) of Art. 19. (ii) The restriction must be reasonable. The Supreme Court has laid down the following guidelines: (i) The term “reasonable restriction” connotes that the limitation imposed on a person in the enjoyment of his right should not be arbitrary or of an excessive nature beyond what is actually required in the interest of public. The word “reasonable” implies intelligent care and deliberation, i.e. choice of a course which reason dictates. Reasonableness has to be determined in an objective manner. Each case is to be judged on its own merit. (ii) The expression “reasonable restriction” seeks to strike a balance between the individual rights guaranteed by Art. 19 and social control permitted by Art. 19(2}-{6). A restriction which is imposed for securing the objects laid down in Directive Principles of State Policy, may be regarded as reasonable. (iii) The restrictions on the rights can only be imposed by,a “law” and not executive or departmental instructions. » (iv) It is the courts and not the legislature which has to judge finally the reasonableness of restriction (both substantive and procedural). A law may be reasonable, but restriction imposed by it on the exercise of freedom may not be reasonable. Rights available to ‘citizens’ only - ‘Citizens’ under Art. 19 mean only natural persons and not legal persons, such as corporations or companies. But, the Bank Nationalization Case has established the view that the fundamental rights of shareholders, editors, and printers, as citizens are not lost when they associate to form a company. Art. 19 (1) (a): Freedom of Speech and Expression Article 19( 1 )(a) says that all citizens shall have the right “to freedom of speech and expression”. But, this right is subject to limitations imposed under Art. 19(2) which empowers the State to put ‘reasonable’ restrictions on the following grounds: “security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order; decency and morality, contempt of court, defamation, incitement to offence, and, sovereignty and integrity of India”. The freedom of speech and expression means the right to express one’s convictions, and opinioni freely by word of mouth, writing, printing, pictures or any other mode. It also includes the right to propagate or publish the views of other people, otherwise this freedom would not include the ‘freedom of press’. The fundamental principle involved here is the people’s right to know. In National Anthem case (1986) 3 SCC 615, held that the freedom under Art. 19(l)(a) also includes the freedom o f silence. Freedom of Press Unlike the American Constitution, Art. 19(1) (a) does not expressly mention the liberty of Constitution/Constitutional Law 37 press i.e. the freedom to print and to publish what one pleases without previous permission. But it is settled law that the right to freedom of speech and expression includes the liberty of the press. Press is supposed to guard public interest by bringing to fore the misdeeds, failings and lapses of the government and other bodies exercising governing power. Rightly, therefore, it has been described as the Fourth Estate. In Bennett Coleman’s case (AIR 1973 SC 106), held that the freedom of newspapers to publish any number of pages or to circulate it to any number of persons and to fix price is each an integral part of the freedom of speech and expression. Freedom of press is both quantitative and qualitative. Freedom lies both in circulation and its content (news and views). In Sakai Paper's case (AIR 1962 SC 305), held that the freedom of speech could not be restricted for the purpose of regulating the commercial aspects of activities of the newspapers. In Express Newspaper v Union o f India (AIR 1958 SC 578), held that a law which imposes pre-censorship (censorship prior to publication) or prevents newspapers from being started or require them to seek government aid in order to survive was violative of Art. I9(lXa). In Express Newspaper s case, held that the press industry is not free from taxation, but tax should be within reasonable limits and does not impede freedom of expression i.e. circulation. In Rajagopal v State ofT.N. (1994) 6 SCC 632, held that the press have the right to publish an unauthorized account of a citizen’s life (autobiography of a convict accused of several murders) in so far as it. js based upon public records. Freedom of the press, the court said, means absence of interference by the State except insofar as it is authorized by the Constitution and by laws. In A jay Goswami v UOI (AIR 2007 SC 493), the ‘freedom of press’ was in issue. The court recognized the right of adults to entertainment within the acceptable level of decency on the ground that it may not be appropriate for children. “Fertile imagination” of minors should not be a matter that should be agitated in court of law. The court considered the applicability of American test of “clear and present danger”. Advertisement, Demonstration, and Films: Whether Protected under Art. 19(lXa)? ‘Advertisement’ is undoubtedly a form of speech. But every form of ad is not a form of speech or expression of ideas e.g. social, political, literary, etc. An ad of a ‘commercial’ nature is not protected under Art. 19( 1 )(a). Such ad has an element of trade and commerce. Professionals like doctors, lawyers and C.A. are legally forbidden to advertise their services. In Tata Press v M.T.N.Lt (1995) 5 SCC 139, the Court declared that the right to “Commercial Speech” or advertisement is part of the freedom of speech guaranteed by Art. 19(l)(a). A private agency like Tata Press is, therefore, entitled to bring out yellow pages comprising advertisements, the annual buyer’s guide for Bombay. ‘Demonstration’ or ‘picketing’ are visible manifestation of one’s ideas and in effect a form of speech and expression.

Such ad has an element of trade and commerce. Professionals like doctors, lawyers and C.A. are legally forbidden to advertise their 
services. In Tata Press v M.T.N.Lt (1995) 5 SCC 139, the Court declared that the right to 
“Commercial Speech” or advertisement is part of the freedom of speech guaranteed by 
Art. 19(l)(a). A private agency like Tata Press is, therefore, entitled to bring out yellow 
pages comprising advertisements, the annual buyer’s guide for Bombay. ‘Demonstration’ or ‘picketing’ are visible manifestation of one’s ideas and in effect 
a form of speech and expression. They are protected under Art. 19(l)(a) provided they are not violent and disorderly. ‘Right to strike’ is not included within the ambit of freedom of speech. In T.K. Rangarajan v State ofT.N. (AIR 2003 SC 3032), held that Government servants have no legal or statutory right to go on strike. In the year 2002, the Government of Tamil Nadu terminated the services of 2 lakh employees under the T.N. Essential Services Maintenance Act, 2002; the government employees had gone on strike for their demands. The court said that “Government employees cannot hold society to ransom by 38 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations going on strike”. If the employees felt aggrieved by any Government action, they should seek redressal -from the statutory machinery provided under different statutory provisions. The court said strike as a weapon is mostly misused which results in chaos and total mal­ administration. Though the trade unions have a guaranteed “right for collective bargaining” on behalf of employees, they have no fundamental right to strike under Art. 19(l)(c). A Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in Harish Uppal v UOl (AIR 2003 SC 739), categorically pronounced that the lawyers had no right to go on strike or give a call for boycott, not even a token strike. It has been suggested that the Advocates can get redressal of their grievances by passing resolutions, making representations and taking out silent processions, holding dharnas or to resort to relay fast, having discussion by giving T.V. interviews and press statements. In James Martin v State o f Kerala (2004) 2 SCC 203, it was held that no person has any right to destroy another’s property in the guise of bandh or hartal or strike, irrespective of the proclaimed reasonableness of the cause or the question whether there is or was any legal sanction for the same. There is need to control such acts with an iron hand. It has been held that the freedom of expression under Art. 19(l)(a) includes the freedom to “fly the national flag” by a citizen at his home, office or business place (Navin Kumar Jindal v Union o f India, 1995). In Union o f India v Navin Jindal (2004) 2 SCC 410, the Supreme Court made certain important observations in respect to the flying of the National Flag: (i) Right to fly the National Flag freely with respect and dignity is a fundamental right of a citizen within the meaning of Art. 19 (l)(a) being an expression and manifestation of his allegiance and feelings and sentiments of pride for the nation. However, such right is not an absolute right but a qualified one being subject to reasonable restrictions under Art. 19(2). 00 The Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950 and the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971 regulate the use of the National Flag. (iii) Flag Code although is not a law within the meaning of Art. 13 (3) of the Constitution of India, for the purpose of Art. 19 (2) it would not restrictively regulate the free exercise of the right of flying the National Flag. However, the Flag Code to the extent it provides for preserving respect and dignity of the National Flag, the same deserves to be followed. (iv) For the purpose of interpretation of the constitutional scheme and for the purpose of maintaining a balance between the fundamental/legal rights of a citizen vis-a-vis, the regulatory measures/restrictions, both Parts IV and IV- A of the Constitution can be taken recourse to. ‘Pre-Censorship of films’ justified under Art. 19(2) on the ground that films have to be treated separately from other forms of art and expression because a motion picture was able to stir up emotions more deeply. Hence, classification of films into ‘A’ & ‘U’ categories held to be valid in K.A. Abbas v Union o f India (AIR 1971 SC 481). Right of citizens to exhibit films on Doordarshan subject to the terms and conditions to be imposed by the Doordarshan is a part of the fundamental right of freedom o f expression (Odyssey Communications Pvt. Ltd. v Lokvidayan Sangathan AIR 1988 SC 1642). Constitulion/Constitutional Law 39 In Union o f India v Motion Pictures Asscn. (AIR 1999 SC 2334), held that the compulsion for cinema owners to show scientific/educational films do not infringe their freedom of speech guaranteed under Art. 19(1 )(a) of the Constitution. ‘Compelled speech’, often known as a ‘must carry’ provision in a Statute, Rule or Regulation, can be an infringement of the right to free speech, except to the extent permitted under Art. 19 (2). In LlC v Manubhai D. Shah (1992) 3 SCC 637, the Supreme Court held that the freedom of speech and expression includes freedom of circulation and propagation of ideas and ‘therefore’ the right extends to the citizen to use the media to answer the criticism levelled against his views propagated by him. A “right to reply’ (by a dissonant note) is implied in the system of Freedom of Expression. The Secretary, Ministry o f I & B v Cricket Association, Bengal with Cricket Association, Bengal v Union o f India (AIR 1995 SC 1236) is a landmark judgment as it recognizes the 'right to information' as part of the fundamental right to speech and expression under Art. 19(1 )(a). The court observed that a citizen has a fundamental right to use the best means of imparting and receiving information through “electronic media”.
----------------------------------------
The Secretary, Ministry o f I & B v Cricket Association, Bengal with Cricket 
Association, Bengal v Union o f India (AIR 1995 SC 1236) is a landmark judgment as it 
recognizes the 'right to information' as part of the fundamental right to speech and 
expression under Art. 19(1 )(a). The court observed that a citizen has a fundamental right 
to use the best means of imparting and receiving information through “electronic media”. Albeit with a caveat: the airwaves are a public resource and must, therefore, be regulated in the public interest. The court ruled that the freedom of speech and expression includes the right to educate, inform and entertain. ‘Sport’ is an expression o f self. The Government can impose restrictions on such a right only on grounds specified in Art. 19(2). State monopoly on electronic media is not mentioned in Art. 19(2). In Union o f India v Asscn. for Democratic Reforms (AIR 2002 SC 2112), it was held that the voter’s right to know antecedents including criminal past of a candidate to membership of Parliament or Legislative Assembly is a fundamental right covered under Art. 19 (1) (a), and. Art. 19 (1) and (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966. The Apex Court observed: The right to get information in a democracy is recognized all throughout and it is a natural right flowing from the concept of democracy. The people of the country have a right to know every public act, everything that is done in a public way by the public functionaries. MPs or MLAs are undoubtedly public functionaries. The right to freedom of speech and expression does not entitle a person to commit ‘contempt of court’ [In Re Arundhati Roy AIR 2002 SC 1375; Radha Mohan Lai v Rajasthan High Court AIR 2003 SC 1467]. The law relating to the Contempt of Courts imposes reasonable restrictions on the freedom and within the ambit of Art. 19 (2) [.Narmada Bachao Andolan v UOl AIR 1999 SC 3345]. Art. 19 (1) (b): Freedom to Assemble Art. 19 (l)(b) secures to all citizens of India the right “to assemble peaceably and without arms”. Thus, there is a right to hold public meetings and demonstrations and take out processions peacefully. Under Art. 19 (3), reasonable restrictions can be imposed on the right by the State by law “in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India or public order”. Thus, an assembly declared unlawful can be validly banned. Art. 1 9 (1) (c): Freedom of Association Art. 19 (l)(c) guarantee to all citizens the right “to form associations and unions for pursuing lawful purposes”. Under Art. 19 (4), however, reasonable restrictions can be imposed by the State “in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India or public 40 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations order or morality”. The associations so formed would include political parties, societies, clubs, companies, organizations, partnership firms, trade unions and indeed any body of persons. It has been held that this Article does not guarantee a ‘right to strike’. In dharam Dull v UOl (AIR 2004 SC 1295), the Supreme Court held that a right to form associations or unions does not include within its ken as a fundamental right a right to form associations or unions for achieving a particular object or running a particular institution, the same being a concomitant or concomitant to a concomitant of a fundamental right, but not the fundamental right itself. The associations or unions of citizens cannot further claim as a fundamental right that they must also be able to achieve the purpose for which they have come into existence so that any interference with such achievement by law shall be unconstitutional, unless the same could be justified under Art. 19 (4). Art. 1 9 (1) (d) & (e): Freedom of Movem ent and Residence The right of every citizen of India “to move freely throughout the territory of India” and his right “to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India” guaranteed under clauses (d) and (e) respectively of Art. 19 (1) are really interlinked. Both the rights lay stress on the oneness of the territory of India. Any citizen can travel to or reside in any part of India. Art. 19 (5), however, provides for imposition of reasonable restrictions on the exercise of these rights by law “in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe”. Generally, the protection afforded by these rights is invoked to challenge the validity of extemment or deportation orders which go to curtail the two freedoms. Restrictions imposed on prostitutes to carry on their trade within a specified area and to reside in or move from particular areas have been held to be valid. Likewise, restrictions on residence imposed on habitual offenders have been upheld. Restrictions on the movement of persons afflicted by AIDS have also been upheld. No political party has the right to call for ‘bandh’ on the plea that it is a part of its fundamental right of speech and expression under Art. 19(1 )(a). The calling for and holding o f ‘bandh’ by a political party/organization involved a threat, express or implied, to citizen not to carry on his activities or to practice his avocation on the day of the ‘bandh’ and hence violative of Arts. 19(l)(a) (b) (c) (d) and 21. Calling for a bandh is different from calling for hartal or strike having regard to the effect of bandh on the fundamental right of the people ‘as a whole’ [Communist Party o f India (M) v Bharat Kumar AIR 1998 SC 184], Art. 19 (1) (g): Freedom of Profession and Trade Under Art. 19 (l)(g) every citizen of India has the right “to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business”. This right is also not absolute and the State can impose reasonable restrictions “in the interest of the general public”. Under Art.
----------------------------------------
19 (l)(g) every citizen of India has the right “to practice any profession or to 
carry on any occupation, trade or business”. This right is also not absolute and the State 
can impose reasonable restrictions “in the interest of the general public”. Under Art. 19(6) the State has also been empowered to prescribe professional or technical qualifications necessary for practicing and profession or carrying on any occupation, trade or business, as well as for enabling the State to carry on any trade or business to the exclusion of citizens wholly or partially. In fact the State is competent to nationalize any trade or to monopolize a trade. Constitution/ConstituHonal Law 41 In B.R. Enterprises v State o f U.P. (AIR 1999 SC 1867), it was held that the right of sale of lottery tickets is not a right under Art. 301 or Art. 19 (I) (g). Lottery has been held to be gambling. In it, there is no skill but only an element of chance, it falls outside the realm of res commercium. Even State lotteries cannot be said to constitute “trade” as contemplated by Art. 301. A person has no fundamental right to carry on trade to the detriment of others (viz. causing of pollution, noise, etc.) (Abhilash Textiles Ltd. v Rajkot Municipal Corporation AIR 1988 Guj 57). In Noise Pollution (K), In re (2005) 5 SCC 733, it was held that the right to speech implies the ‘right to silence’. It implies freedom, not to listen, and not to be forced to listen. Free speech is not to be treated as a promise to everyone with opinions and beliefs, to gather at any place and at any time and express their views in any manner. A person can decline to read a publication, or switch off a radio or television set. But, he cannot prevent the sound from a loudspeaker reaching him. He could be forced to hear what he wishes not to hear. No one has a right to trespass on the mind or ear of another and commit auricular or visual aggression. In T.M.A. Pai Foundation v State o f Karnataka (2002) 8 SCC 481, the Supreme Court for the first time brought into existence the concept of education as an “occupation", a term used in Art. 19 (l)(g) of the Constitution. The fundamental right to establish and run educational institutions is thus subject to reasonable restrictions under Art. 19 (4). In State o f Gujarat v Mirzapur Moti Qureshi Kassab Jamet (AIR 2006 SC 212), it was held that the prohibition of slaughter of cows and her progeny does not amount to total ban on activity of butchers. It is not a prohibition but only a restriction. They can slaughter animals other than cow progeny and carry on their activity. Cow and her progeny are the backbone of Indian agriculture and economy. Thus, the ban on slaughter of cow progeny is in the interest of general public and is reasonable restriction within the meaning of Art. 19(6) of the Constitution. It is not violative of the fundamental right to carry on trade and business under Art. 19(l)(g) of the Constitution. ARTICLE 20: Protection In Respect of Conviction for Offences Under Art. 20, the Constitution of India has taken care to safeguard the rights of persons accused of crimes. This Article cannot be suspended even during an emergency by an order under Art. 359. Art. 2 0 (1): Ex-Post Facto Law According to Art. 20 (1), “no person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of law in force at the time of commission of the act charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of commission of offence”. Thus, the legislature is prohibited to make criminal laws having retrospective effect. Art. 20 (1) is not applicable to a trial or a civil liability or preventive detention case. Art. 2 0 (2): Double Jeopardy Article 20 (2) provides that “no person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once”. The principle of double jeopardy has been already recognized in the Sec. 26, General Clauses Act and Sec. 300, Cr. P.C. The protection afforded by Art. 20 (2) is. 42- Law Guide for Competitive Examinations however, attracted only in respect of punishment inflicted by court of law or judicial tribunal. .Thus, a Government servant prosecuted and convicted by a court of law can be punished under departmental proceedings for the same offence. Similarly, it does not ban proceedings before a civil court for disobedience of an injunction along with criminal proceedings. Art. 2 0 (3): Protection Against Self-Incrlmlnatlon Art. 20 (3) lays down that “no person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself’. In other words, the accused person is protected against incriminating himself under compulsion e.g. ‘making a statement which makes the case against the accused person at least probable considered by itself. Compulsion in this context would mean “duress” (State of Bombay v Kathi Kolu Oghad AIR 1961 SC 1808). In NandiniSathpathy v P.L. Dani (AIR 1978 SC 1025), the Supreme Court held that “relevant replies which furnish a real and clear link in the chain of evidence indeed to bind down the accused with the crime become incriminatory and offend Art. 20 (3) if elicited by pressure from the mouth of the accused”. It widened the scope of compulsion and held that “compelled testimony” is evidently procured not merely by physical threats or violence but also by psychic torture, atmospheric pressure, environmental coercion, tiring interrogative proximity, overbearing and intimidating methods and the like. In Sampath Kumar v E.O. Enforcement Directorate, Madras (AIR 1998 SC 16), held that administration of “caution” to person summoned that not making truthful statement was an offence, did not amount to use of pressure within the meaning of Art. 20 (3).
----------------------------------------
In Sampath Kumar v E.O. Enforcement Directorate, Madras (AIR 1998 SC 16), held 
that administration of “caution” to person summoned that not making truthful statement 
was an offence, did not amount to use of pressure within the meaning of Art. 20 (3). Administration of such a caution, the Court said, was, in fact, in the interest of the person who was making the statement. The privilege given by Art. 20 (3) to the accused person may be waived by him. Thus, this Article is not violated when he volunteers evidence against himself. Further, the immunity granted to the accused does not extend to compulsory production of material objects or compulsion to give specimen writing/ signature, finger impression or giving of blood specimens. Also, compulsion for production of documents is prohibited only if the documents convey the personal knowledge of the accused relating to the charge. Search of the premises of a person accused of an offence under a search warrant and seizure of the documents are not violative of Art. 20 (3). ARTICLE 21: Protection of Life and Personal Liberty Art. 21 reads: ‘Wo person shall be deprived o f his life or personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law." After the Maneka Gandhis decision. Art. 21 now protects the right of life and personal liberty not only from the executive action but from the legislative action also. The right guaranteed in Art. 21 is available to citizens as well as non-citizens (Chairman, Railway Board v Chandrima Das AIR 2000 SC 988). Art. 21-A (Right to Education) Inserted by the 86th Constitution Amendment Act, 2002: "The State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children between the age o f 6 and 14 years in such manner as the State may, by law, determine." Constitution/Constitutional Law 43 Eighty-sixth Amendment (93rd Amendment Bill) has added Art. 2I-A after Art. 21 making the ‘right of education’ of children of the age of 6-14 years a Fundamental Right. Every child/citizen has right to free education until he completes the age of 14 years. Thereafter, his right to education is “subject to the limits o f economic capacity and development o f the State." Personal liberty: Meaning and Scope In A.K. Copalan’s case (AIR 1950 SC 27), the court took the view that ‘personal liberty’ only means ‘liberty relating to or concerning the person or body of the individual’. In England, the expression has been understood in the restricted sense. Dicey has said, “right to personal liberty means a person’s right not to be subjected to imprisonment, arrest, or other physical coercion in any manner that does not admit of legal justification”. But, in Kharak Singh v State o f Punjab (AIR 1963 SC 1295), the term ‘personal liberty’ was interpreted to be a compendious term including within itself all the varieties of rights which go to make up the personal liberty of man other than those dealt with in Art. 19(1). While Art. 19(1) deals with particular species or attributes of that freedom, ‘personal liberty’ in Art. 21 takes in and comprises the residue. In R. C. Cooper v Union o f India (AIR 1970 SC 564), it was held that each freedom has different dimensions and there may be overlapping between different fundamental rights and therefore it is not a valid argument to say that the expression ‘personal liberty’ in Art. 21 must be so interpreted as to avoid overlapping between that Art. 21 and Art. 19(1). In Maneka Gandhi v Union o f India (AIR 1978 SC 597), Bhagwati J. observed: “The expression ‘personal liberty’ is of widest amplitude and it covers a variety of rights which go to constitute the personal liberty of man and some of them have raised to the status of distinct fundamental rights and given additional protection under Art. 19. Art. 21 is controlled by Arts. 14 and 19. The concept of reasonableness must be projected in the procedure contemplated by Art. 21 having regard to the impact of Art. 14 on Art. 21.” The interaction of Articles 14, 19 and 21 analyzed by the Court in this case, demonstrates that the requirement of ‘reasonableness’ runs like ‘a golden thread through the entire fabric of fundamental rights’. In Francis Coralie v Delhi Admn. (AIR 1981 SC 746), held that the word ‘personal liberty’ is of widest amplitude and it includes the ‘right to socialize' (by a detenu) with members of family and friends subject to reasonable prison regulations. Detenu’s right to have interview with his lawyer and family member is part of his ‘personal liberty’ guaranteed by Art. 21. Right to ‘live’ is not merely confined to physical existence but it includes within its ambit the right to live with human dignity (vide Maneka Gandhi case), and all that goes along with it, namely, the bare necessities of life such as adequate nutrition, clothing, and shelter, and facilities for reading, writing, and expressing ourselves in diverse forms, freely moving about and mixing with fellow human beings. Scope o f 'procedure established by law ’ - The term ‘procedure established by law’ is a narrower term in comparison to the term ‘due process of law’, because the former includes only procedural law (C.P.C, Cr. P.C. etc.) while the latter includes both substantive law (I.P.C., Hindu Marriage Act, etc.) and procedural law. The phrase ‘due process of law’ is used in the American Constitution. In Maneka Gandhi fcase, Bhagwati J. did not applied the concept of “due process” as such in the context of Art. 21, when he stated that the protection secured by Art. 21 44 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations is a limited one in as much as Art. 21 safeguards the right to ‘personal liberty’ against executive interference which is not supported by law, and law here means ‘enacted law’ or ‘State law’. However, he read ‘procedure’ in Art.

did not applied the concept of “due process” 
as such in the context of Art. 21, when he stated that the protection secured by Art. 21
44
Law Guide for Competitive Examinations
is a limited one in as much as Art. 21 safeguards the right to ‘personal liberty’ against 
executive interference which is not supported by law, and law here means ‘enacted law’ 
or ‘State law’. However, he read ‘procedure’ in Art. 21 not as prescribing any specific procedure, but only that procedure which conforms to the principles of natural justice i.e. procedure has to be ‘fair, right and just’. Further, Krishna Iyer J., extended the guarantee in Art. 21 not only to ‘procedure’ as being fair and just, but also to ‘law’ as being ‘reasonable’; it meant in a way reading ‘procedure established by law’ as almost amounting to ‘due process of law’ in the American sense. Im plied Fundam ental Rights under Art. 2 1 A new judicial trend has emerged from the cases of Maneka Gandhi. Sunil Batra, Hoskot and Hussainara Khatoon, in which the Supreme Court has taken the view that the provisions of Part III of the Constitution of India should be given widest possible interpretation. In Maneka Gandhi’s case, Bhagwati J., said, “the correct way o f interpreting the provisions o f Part 111 is that attempt o f the court should be to expand the reach and ambit o f the fundamental rights rather than to attenuate their meaning and content." Article 21 is worded in negative terms as it prohibits or restricts State’s actions, rather than require it to do something beneficial for the citizens, a positive aspect. By an activist interpretation most of the fundamental rights, especially the right to equality (Art. 14) freedom of speech and expression [Art. 19(l)(a)] and right to life and personal liberty (Art. 21) have been converted into a regime of positive human rights unknown in previous constitutional diction. By an affirmative action the courts are trying to force the government to create favourable conditions for effective realization of the new individual, collective, diffuse rights. The Supreme Court has held that to be a fundamental right it is not necessary that a right must be specifically mentioned in a particular Article. Even if it is not mentioned in any of the Articles specifically, it may be a fundamental right if it is an integral part o f a named fundamental right or partakes o f the same basic nature and character as that fundamental right. Every activity which facilitates the exercise of the named fundamental right may be considered integral part of that right and hence be a fundamental right. The discoveries of egalitarian goals in the fundamental rights have resulted in the explosion of rights. Thus, Article 21 of the Constitution has sprung up a whole lot of human rights jurisprudence. For example, it has been held that these are fundamental rights under Article 21, though not specifically mentioned: (0 Right to speedy trial (M.H. Hoskot v State o f Maharashtra, AIR 1978 SC 1548; Hussainara Khatoon v State o f Bihar, AIR 1980 SC 1819; Raj Deo Sharma v State o f Bihar ( 1998) 7 SCC 507). (it-) Right to travel abroad (Maneka Gandhi’s case). (iii) Right to dignity (Maneka Gandhi, Francis Coralie cases). (iv) Right to privacy (Govind v State o f M.P.). (v) Right to clean environment (M.C. Mehta v Union o f India). (vi) Right to livelihood (Olga Tellis case). (vii) Rieht to education (Mohini Jain and Unni Krishnan cases). Constitution/Constitutional Law 45 (viii) Right to die (Rathinam v Union o f India). (ix) Right against torture (Sunil Balra v Delhi Admn., AIR 1980 SC 1979; Jolly Varghese v Bank o f Cochin, AIR 1980 SC 470; Khatri v Slate o f Bihar (1981) 1 SCC 623). (x) Right against bondage (Bandhua Mukti Morcha case). People's Union For Democratic Rights v Union of India, (1982) 2 S.C.C. 235; Neeraja Chaudhary v State ofM.P., (1984) 3 SCC 243). (xi) Right to legal aid (Sheela Barse v Union o f India, (1986) 3 S.C.C. 632; Suk Das case, (1986) 2 SCC 401). (xii) Right to food (PUCL v UOl 2000 (5) SCALE). Similarly, the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Art. 19 (I) (a) includes the right to know, right to information, right to reply etc. Freedom of press is inferred from the freedom of speech and expression. In State ofM.P. v Ram Kishan Balothia (AIR 1995 SC 1198), held that anticipatory bail cannot be granted as a matter of right. It is essentially a statutory right. Similarly, the ‘right to vote’ is a statutory right and not a fundamental/ common law right. The right to vote is subject to the limitations imposed by the statute, and the challenge to any provision in the statute prescribing the nature of right to elect cannot be made with reference to a fundamental right in the Constitution. Thus, Prisoners/Under trials cannot claim a right to vote (Anukul Chandra Pradhan v Union o f India AIR 1997 SC 2814). Case Law (0 In R. Rajagopal v State ofT.N. (1994) 6 SCC 632, held that the “right to privacy” is included in Art. 21 and a “citizen has a right to safeguard the privacy of his own, his family, marriage, procreation, motherhood, child bearing and education among other matters”. In State of Maharashtra v Madhidkar Narain (AIR 1991 SC 207), it was held that this right is available even to a woman of easy virtue, and no one can invade her privacy. Right against “sexual harassment in work places” has been recognized in Vishaka v State o f Rajasthan (AIR 1997 SC 3011).
----------------------------------------
Right against “sexual harassment in work places” has been recognized in Vishaka v State 
o f Rajasthan (AIR 1997 SC 3011). Also, in Apparel Export Promotion Council v A.K. Chopra (AIR 1999 SC 625), the Supreme Court applied the law laid down in Vishaka's case and upheld the dismissal from service of a superior officer who was found guilty of “sexual harassment” of a subordinate female employee at the place of work on the ground that it violated her fundamental rights guaranteed by Art. 21 (right to dignity) and Art. 14. A Bill (Mo. XI of 1998) to provide for the prevention of sexual harassment of women employees at their work places has been introduced in the Parliament. Sec. 2 (c) of the Bill defines “sexual harassment” as including any unwanted verbal or gestrual sexual advances, sexually implicit and derogatory statements or remarks, avoidable physical contacts, touching or patting, suggestive remarks, sexually slanted and obscene jokes, comments about physical appearance, compromising invitations, use of pornographic material, demands for sexual favours, threats, innuendoes, physical assault and molestation of and towards women workers by their male superiors, colleagues or anyone who for the time being is in a position to sexually harass the women workers. 46 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations When a person is talking on telephone, he is exercising his right to freedom of speech and expression. “Telephone-tapping” unless it comes within the grounds of restrictions under Art. 19(2) would infract Art. 19 (l)(a)” (People’s Union for Civil Liberties v Union of India AIR 1997 SC 568). The judgment of the Supreme Court will go a long way in protecting the ‘right of privacy’ of Indian citizens enshrined under Art. 21. In State o f Bihar v Lai Krishna Advani (AIR 2003 SC 3357), the Apex Court made it clear that one was entitled to have and preserve one’s reputation and one also had a right to protect it. In R.D. Upadhayay v State o f Andhra Pradesh (AIR 2006 SC 1946), the Apex Court showing serious concern regarding the plight of children living in jails with prisoner mothers issued detailed directions for their interest regarding food, shelter, medical care, clothing, education and recreation facilities which are declared to be child’s right. The court directed that the child above 6 years not to be kept with female prisoners. Birth of child in prison is not to be recorded as ‘prison’ in Birth Certificate. In Lata Singh v State o f U.P. (AIR 2006 SC 2522), it was held that the right to life includes ‘right to marriage’ A major boy or girl undergoing inter-caste or inter-religious marriage are to be protected from harassment, threats or acts of violence. Stern action should be taken against person who give threats or harass or commit violences Right to Privacy o f an AIDS Patient - In Mr. X ' v Hospital ‘Z ’ (Dr. Tokugha Yepthomi v Appollo Hospital AIR 1999 SC 495) held that the ‘right to privacy’ is not absolute. Where there is a clash of two fundamental rights, namely, the appellant’s right to privacy as part of right to life and his fiancee’s right to lead a healthy life which is her fundamental right under Art. 21, the right that would advance the public morality or public interest, would alone be enforced through the process of court. Thus, the hospital authorities could waive confidentiality in the public interest. In Mr. X ’ v Hospital ‘Z ’ (AIR 2003 SC 664), the Supreme Court partly overruled the earlier decision (AIR 1999 SC 495) and confined it to that “it was open to the hospital or the doctor concerned to reveal information about the ‘AIDS status’ of a person to persons related to the girl whom he intended to marry and she had a right to know about the HIV positive status of the appellant.” (ii) In Olga Tellis v Bombay Municipal Corpn. (AIR 1986 SC 180), (also known as pavement dwellers' case), the court held that the world life in Art. 21 includes the right to livelihood also, because no person can live without the means of livelihood. (iii) In Shiv Sagar Tiwari v Union o f India (AIR 1997 SC 2725), the out-of-tum allotments of Government residential quarters on ‘special compassionate ground’ in Delhi were in issue. The Supreme Court while recognizing the ‘right to shelter’ emphasized the need to prevent or regulate “illegal shelter”. (iv) The Supreme Court (A/. C. Mehta cases) and High Courts in India have interpreted the right to life and personal liberty to include the “right to a wholesome environment." In T. Damodhar Rao v Municipal Corpn. of Hyderabad (AIR 1987 AP 171), the court held that the enjoyment o f life and its attainment and fulfillment guaranteed by Art. 21 embraces the protection and preservation o f nature's gifts without which life cannot be enjoyed. Constitution/Constitutional Law 47 In Kinkri Devi v State o f H.P. (AIR 1988 HP 4), the court held that if a just balance is not struck between development through tapping of natural resources and the protection of ecology and environment, there will be a violation of fundamental rights conferred by Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. In Subhash Kumar v State o f Bihar (AIR 1991 SC 420), the court held the right to live includes the right of enjoyment of pollution-free water and air for full enjoyment of life. In Murli S. Deora v UOI (2001) 8 SCC 765, realizing the gravity of the situation and considering the adverse effect of smoking on smokers and passive smokers, the court directed and prohibited smoking in public places and issued direction to the Union of India, State Governments and UTs to take effective steps to ensure prohibiting smoking in public places. In N.D. Jayal v UO/ (AIR 2004 SC 867), it was held that right to clean environment and right to development are integral parts of human rights covered by Art. 2 1.
----------------------------------------
In N.D. Jayal v UO/ (AIR 2004 SC 867), it was held that right to clean environment 
and right to development are integral parts of human rights covered by Art. 2 1. Sustainable development is a means to achieve the object and purpose of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 as well as protection of “life” envisaged under Art. 21 of the Constitution. The construction of dam (Tehri Dam) is a component of development and a strict compliance with the Environment Act is necessary. In Intellectuals Forum, Tirupathi v State o f Andhra Pradesh (AIR 2006 SC 1350), the Supreme Court has held that under Art. 21 and Art. 51-A, it is the constitutional obligation of the Government to protect and preserve the environment. In the name of urban development, the environment (fresh water resources in the present case) cannot be destroyed. Emphasising the need of sustainable development, the court held that the right of shelter is not so pressing need so as to outweigh all environmental considerations. As per the doctrine of 'public trust’, the natural resources which includes lakes are held by the State as a trustee of public, and can be disposed of only in a manner that is consistent with nature of such trust. In Milk Men Colony Vikas Samiti v State o f Rajasthan (2007) 2SCC 413, the Supreme Court held that the ‘right to life’ means clean surroundings which lead to healthy body and mind. It includes right to freedom from stray cattle and animals in urban areas. (v) In Mohini Jain v State o f Karnataka (AIR 1992 SC 1858), the Supreme Court held that every citizen has a "right to education' under the Constitution. The right to education is concomitant to the fundamental rights. Thus, right to freedom of speech and expression cannot be fully enjoyed unless a citizen is educated and conscious of individualistic dignity. Right to education is implicit in right to life because of its inherent fundamental importance (in the life of an individual). The State is under a constitutional mandate to provide education at all levels (including professional education like medicine, engineering) for citizens. In Unni Krishnan v State o f A.P. (“Capitation Fee Case") (AIR 1993 SC 2178), the five- judge bench which was constituted to review the two-judge bench decision of the court in Mohini Jain’s case, by 3-2 majority held that admission to all recognized private educational institutions particularly medical and engineering, shall be based on merit ("free seats”), but 50% of seats in all professional colleges be filled by candidates prepared to pay a higher fee (“payment seats”). 48 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations (vi) In Consumer Education & Research Centre v Union o f India (AIR 1995 SC 922), the Supreme Court has held that the “right to health and medical care” is a fundamental right under Art. 21 as it is essential for making the life of the workmen meaningful and purposeful with dignity of person. ‘Right to life’ in Art. 21 includes protection of the health and strength of the worker. (vii) The Bombay High Court in case of State o f Maharashtra v Marut'i Sripati Dubai (HT, Oct. 12, 1986), held that the right to live guaranteed by Art. 21 include also a “right to die”. In Rathinam v Union o f India (1994) 2 SCALE VOL II No. 7674, the Supreme Court held that a person has a right to die and declared unconstitutional Sec. 309,1.P.C., which makes attempt to commit suicide a penal offence. The right to live in Art. 21 includes the right not to live i.e. right to die. A person can't be forced to enjoy right to life to his detriment, disadvantage or disliking. But, the court rejected the plea that euthanasia (mercy killing) should be permitted by law. There is a distinction between an attempt of a person to take his life and action of some others to bring to an end the life of a third person. In Gian Kaur v State o f Punjab (1996) 2 SCC 648, a five judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court overruled the P. Rathinam’s case and held that ‘right to life’ under Art. 21 does not include ‘right to die’ or ‘right to be killed’. The ‘right to die’ is inherently inconsistent with the ‘right to life’ as is ‘death with life’. The Court accordingly held that Sec. 309 of I PC is not violative of Art. 21. (viii) In State o f U.P. v Raj Narain (AIR 1975 SC 865), the court held that the people have a “right to know” every public act, everything that is done in a public way, by their public functionaries. In S.P Gupta v Union o f India (AIR 1982 SC 149), the court recognized the right to know to be implicit in the right to free speech and expression i.e. Art. 19(l)(a). In Reliance Petrochemical Ltd. v Proprietors o f Indian Express Newspapers Bombay Pvt. Ltd. (AIR 1989 SC 190) the court recognized the right to know as emanating from the right to life i.e. Art. 21. (ix) In PUCL v UOl (2000), recognizing the ‘right to food’ the Supreme Court held that the people who are starving because of their inability to purchase food grains (viz. aged, infirm, disabled, destitute men/women, pregnant and lactating women and destitute children) ought to be provided the same free of cost by the States out of surplus stock lying with the States. ARTICLE 22: Safeguards Against Arbitrary Arrest and Detention Article 22 prescribes the minimum procedural requirements that must be included in any law enacted by the legislature in accordance with which a person may be deprived of his life and personal liberty. Thus, Art. 21 has to be read as supplemented by Art. 22. Art. 22 is not a complete code, and a law relating to preventive detention must satisfy requirement of Articles 14, 19 and 21, thus procedure prescribed under the preventive detention law must be reasonable, just and fair.
----------------------------------------
Clauses (I) and (2) - guarantees four rights to the persons (citizens and non-citizens) who are arrested under an ordinary law: Constitution/Constitutional Law 49 (a) the right to be informed ‘as soon as may be’ of ground of arrest, (b) the right to consult and to be represented by a lawyer of his own choice, (c) the right to be produced before a Magistrate within 24 hours, and (d) no detention beyond 24 hours except by the order of Magistrate. In Joginder Kumar v State o f U.P. (1994) 4 SCC 260, the Supreme Court has laid down guidelines governing arrest of a person during the investigation. The court laid down the following guidelines: (0 An arrested person being held in custody is entitled to have pne^ friend, relative or other person who is known to him or likely to take an interest in his welfare told as far as is practicable that he has been arrested and where he is being detained. (ii) Police Officer shall inform the arrested person, when he is brought to police station, of this right. (iii) An entry shall be required to be made in the police diary as to who Was informed of the arrest. In D. K. Bastt v State ofW .B. (AIR 1997 SC 610), the Supreme Court took serious note of custodial violence and death in police lock-up. It laid down various guidelines to be followed in all cases of arrest or detention. I : Clause (3) - provides two exceptions to rule contained in clause (1) and (2). It says that rights under clause (1) and (2) are not available to (a) an enemy alien, and, (b) a person detained under a Preventive Detention law. Preventive Detention Clause^ (4) to (7) of Art. 22 provides the procedure which is to be followed if a person is arrested under the law of Preventive Detention. Preventive Detention means ‘detention of a person without trial’. There is no authoritative definition of the term “preventive detention” in Indian law. While the object of the punitive detention is to punish a man for having done something, the object of preventive detention is to intercept him before he does it and to prevent him from doing it. No offence is proved nor any charge is formulated. The sole justification of such detention is suspicion or reasonable probability of the detenu committing some act likely to cause harm to society or endanger the security of the Government, and not criminal conviction which can only be warranted by legal evidence. Various such laws have been enacted e.g. MISA (Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971); Prevention o f Black-marketing and Maintenance o f Supplies o f Essential Commodities Act; NSA (National Security Act); COFEPOSA, TADA, etc. *•> Constitutional Safeguards Against Preventive Detention Laws Such safeguards against Preventive Detention laws are necessary to mitigate their harshness, by placing fetters on legislative power conferred on the Legislature. It is fo r, this reason that Art. 22 has been given a place in the chapter on “guaranteed rights”. Clauses (4) to (7) provides the following safeguards: (a) Review by Advisory Board. 50 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations (b) Composition and procedure of Advisory Board. (c) Grounds of detention and representation. (a) Review by Advisory Board Clause (4) (prior to 44th Amendment)- No law providing for preventive detention shall authorize the detention of a person for a longer period than 3 months unless, (a) an advisory board consisting of who are, or have been, or are qualified to be appointed as Judges of a High Coiirt has reported before the expiration of said period of 3 months that there is in its opinion sufficient cause'for such detention, and (b) such person is detained in accordance with the provisions of any law made by parliament under (a) and (b) of Clause (7). 'Clause (4) (after 44th Amendment) - The Amendment reduced the period from 3 months to 2 months i.e. period for which a person may be detained without obtaining the opinion of Board. The Amendment made the Advisory Board an independent body i.e. free from executive control. The Amendment abolished the provision for preventive detention without reference to an Advisory Board as provided in Clause (7) (a). Clause (7): (a) Parliament may by law prescribe the circumstances under which a person may be detained for a period longer than 3 months, without obtaining the opinion o f an Advisory Board. (Sub-clause (a) now deleted), (b) Parliament may by law prescribe the maximum period for which a person may be detained under any law providing for preventive detention. (Note: 44th Amendment has not yet been brought into force.) If the Advisory Board reports that detention is not justified the Government is duty bound to revoke the detention order. If the Board reports that detention is justified, than only the detaining authorities determine the period of detention, however the Board cannot express any opinion as to how much longer than 3 months the detenu should be kept in detention. If the Board fails to submit report before expiration o f said 3 months, the detention would become illegal. (b) Composition and Procedure of Advisory Board The Constitution of the Advisory Board has to be in accordance with the recommendation of Chief Justice of the Appropriate High Court. The chairman of the Board has to be a serving judge of High Court and other members have to be serving or retired judges of High Court. (c) Grounds of Detention and Representation Clause (5) - gives two rights to the detenu: (a) the authority making the order of detention must “as soon as may be” communicate to the person detained the grounds of his arrest i.e. the grounds which led to subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority, (b) to give the detenu “the earliest opportunity” of making a representation against the order of detention i.e. to be furnished with sufficient particulars to enable him to make a representation. Art.
----------------------------------------
Art. 22 (5) cast a duty on detaining authority to inform the detenu while serving the order of detention that he has a right to make representation against the order o f detention and also a right to be heard by the Advisory Board. It is to be noted that the consideration Constitution/Constitutional Law 51 of representation by detaining authority is entirely independent o f any action Ijy Advisory Board including the consideration of representation by the Board (Jaynarain Sukul v State ofW .B. AIR 1979 SC 675). The National Security Act provides that the detenu will be conveyed the grounds of the detention within 5 days and in exceptional cases within 10 days o f his detention. If there are exceptional circumstances, the detaining authority is to record its reasons in Writing. It is important to note that the grounds o f detention must be existent at the time of making the order. Subjective satisfaction of detaining authority can be challenged on the following grounds, namely, mala fid e or vagueness, and irrelevant or non-existent grounds or mechanical application of mind of detaining authority. Exception to Clause (5): Clause (6) provides that the authority to the detenu may Hot furnish disclosure of facts which are considered to be against public interest. In A.K. Roy v UOI (AIR 1982 SC 710), popularly known as the “NSA (National Security Act) Case”, the Supreme Court by 4-1 majority upheld the constitutional validity of the NSA. Held that the right of legal representation before the Board is not permissible [as contemplated by exceptions to Art. 22(1) and (2)]. Art. 22(5) gives a right to make a representation against the detention order, but that right does not carry with it the said right. The detaining authority also does not have such right. However, even in the face of constitutional and statutory denial of legal representation to a detenu, he is entitled to a common law right of representation through a ‘friend’ (but that ‘friend’ should not be a lawyer, law professor, etc.). Also held that a detenu has no right to cross-examine, but has right to present his own evidence in rebuttal of the allegations made against hiin. The court reasoned that firstly the question before the Board is not whether the detenu is guilty o f any charge but whether there is sufficient cause for his detention and, secondly, the witnesses would be most reluctant to testily and often it may harm public interest to disclose their identity [Art. 22(6)]. It also laid down that the detenu must be detained in a place where he habitually resides, unless exceptional circumstances require detention at other place. In Attorney General o f India v Amrit Lai, (1994) 5 SCC 54, a 9-judge Constitution Bench of Supreme Court held that during the period o f emergency the President is empowered to suspend fundamental rights of people and a detenu has no locus standi to question the reasons or grounds of his detention. The court upheld Sec. 12-A of COFEPOSA which had done away with the requirements of supply of grounds o f detention and the consultation with Advisory Board during the emergency. ARTICLES 2 3 -2 4 : Right Against Exploitation Article 23 prohibits “traffic in human beings and begar and other forced labour”. Traffic in human beings — women, children, etc. - and forced labour militate against human dignity. Under the old zamindari system, the tenants were sometimes jerced to render free service to their landlords. This was called begar. It has been held that even If some remuneration is paid, the labour may be a forced one (P U pR v UOI AIR 1982 SC 1473). Devadasis are also covered under the term “traffic in human beings”. Children of the prostitutes have a right to equality of opportunity, dignity, care, protection and rehabilitation so as to be part of the mainstream o f social life (Gaurav Jain v UO/ AIR 52 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations 1997 SC 3021). It may be noted that Art. 23 does not prohibit the State from imposin,, compulsory service for public purposes e.g. social or military service. In State o f Guja/-ai v H on’ble ffigh Court o f Gujarat (1998) 7 SCC 392, held that exaction of hard labour fr0tt1 convicted prisoners is not forced labour. Article'24 prohibits “employing children below age of 14 in any hazardous employment” This is in keeping with the human rights concepts and United Nations norms. In M.c, Mehta v State ofT.N. (AIR 1997 SC 609), held that children below the age of 14 years cannot be employed in any hazardous industry, mines or other works and has laid down exhaustive guidelines how the State authorities should protect economic, social and humanitarian rights of m|Ilions of working children. In Bandhua Mukti Morcha v Union o f India (AIR 1997 SC 2218), the court observed: “The basic cause for child labour being poverty, instead of its total abolition which will have adverse effect, it should be banned progressively in a planned manner starting from the most hazardous and intolerable activities like slavery, bonded labour, trafficking, prostitution, pornography and dangerous forms of labour, etc.” ARTICLES 25-28: Right to Freedom of Religion Articles 25 and 26 embody the principles of religious tolerance that has been the characteristic feature of Indian civilization from the start of history. Besides they serve to emphasize the secular nature of Indian democracy i.e. equal respect tp all religions. A secular State does not mean an irreligious State, it only means that in matters of religion it is ‘neutral’, the State can have no religion of its own, and the State protects all religions but interferes with none. In a secular State, the State is only concerned with the relation between man and man, it is not concerned with the relation o f man with God. It is left to the individual’s conscience.
----------------------------------------
A secular State does not mean an irreligious State, it only means that in matters 
of religion it is ‘neutral’, the State can have no religion of its own, and the State protects 
all religions but interferes with none. In a secular State, the State is only concerned with 
the relation between man and man, it is not concerned with the relation o f man with God. It is left to the individual’s conscience. The word ‘secularism’, however, is vague as it might be used as an instrument of unrestrained communalism or bigotry or anti-religionism. In Santosh Kumar v Secy., Ministry o f Human Resources Development, AIR 1995 SC 293, the court said that “State tolerance of religion, does not make it either a religious or a theocratic State.” Secularism is neither ante-God nor pro-God, as it treats alike the devout, antagonistic and the atheist. In S.R. Bommai v Union o f India J.T. 1994 (2) SC 215, the court held that ‘secularism’ is a basic feature of the Constitution and any State Government which acts against that ideal can be dismissed by the President. In matters of State, religion has no place. No political party can simultaneously be a religious party, and, politics and religion cannot be mixed. In M. Ismail Faruqui v Union o f India (“Ayodhya Case”) (AIR 1995 SC 605), the court observed: “The concept of secularism is one facet o f the right to equality woven as the central golden thread in the fabric depicting the pattern of the scheme in Constitution. Moreover, any step taken to arrest escalation o f communal tension and to achieve communal accord and harmony can, by no stretch of argumentation, be termed non­ secular or anti-secular. Secularism is a creed of the Indian people embedded in the ethos”. Art. 2 5 : Freedom o f Conscience an d Free P rofession, P ra c tic e and Propagation o f Religion (1) Subject to “public order, morality and health and to the other provisions o f Part III of Constitution”, all persons are equally entitled to freedom o f conscience and the right freely to profess, practice and propagate religion. Constitution/Conslitutional Law 53 (2) Nothing in this Article shall affect the operation o f any existing law or prevent the State from making any law - (a) regulating or restricting any economic, financial, political, or other secular activity which may be associated with religious practice; (b) providing for social welfare and reform or the throwing open of Hindu religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections o f Hindus. Explanation I - The wearing and carrying of Kirpans shall be deemed to be included in the profession of Sikh religion. Explanation II - The expression “Hindu” includes Jain, Sikhs and Buddhists. Religion is essentially a matter o f personal faith and belief. Freedom o f conscience connotes a person’s right to entertain beliefs and doctrines concerning matters which are regarded by him to be conducive to his spiritual well being. To 1profess’ a religion means to declare freely and openly one’s faith and belief by practical expression in any manner one likes. To ‘practice’ religion is to perform the prescribed religious duties, rites and rituals. To ‘propagate’ means to spread and publicize his religious views for the edification of others. The right to propagate one’s religion does not give a right to convert another person to one’s own religion, as that would impinge on the “freedom o f conscience” guaranteed to all persons (Stainlaus v State o f M.P. AIR 1977 SC 908). In Bijoe Emmanuel v State o f Kerala (1986) 3 SCC 615 (“National Apthem Case”), fhree children belonging to the ‘Jehovah’s witnesses’ of Christian community were expelled from school for refusing to sing National Anthem. The Kerala High Court held that it was their Fundamental Duty under the Constitution to sing the National Anthem. The Supreme Court, however, held that there is no legal obligation for a citizen to sing national anthem. The freedom of speech and expression under Art. 19(l)(a) also includes the freedom o f silence'. The court said that by standing up while the anthem was being sung, the children had shown proper respect to national anthem and had thus not violated the fundamental duty (Art. 51 A). It relied heavily on the decisions of Australian and American Supreme Courts (Minersville School v Gobitis and West Virginia Board o f Education v Barnette). The Court observed: Art. 25 is an Article of faith in the Constitution, incorporated in recognition of the principle that the real test of a true democracy is the ability o f even an insignificant minority to find its identity under Constitution. The question is not whether a particular religious belief or practice appeals to our reason or sentiment, but whether the belief is genuinely and conscientiously held as part o f the profession or practice o f religion. Thus, held that no person can be compelled to sing the national anthem “if he has genuine conscientious religious objection”. Restrictions on Freedom of Religion Art. 25: Clause(l) - In the name of religion, no act can be done against public order, morality and health of the public. For example, in the name o f religion ‘untouchability or traffic in human beings’ e.g. system of devadasis cannot be tolerated. The freedom o f religion is also subject to the “other provisions of this Part” e.g., right to freedom o f speech and expression, freedom of assembly and association, etc. 54 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations Clause (2)(a) - The freedom to practice extends only to those activities which are the ‘essence of religion’ [State ofW.B. v Ashutosh Lahiri (1995) 1 SCC 189]. It does not cover secular, political or commercial activities associated with religious practice.
----------------------------------------
It does not cover 
secular, political or commercial activities associated with religious practice. In Acharya Jagdishwaranand v Commissioner o f Police, Calcutta (‘Anand Margj' Case) (1984) 4 SCC 522, held that the ‘Tandava dance’ in procession or at public places by Ananda Margis carrying lethal weapons and human skulls was not an ‘essential1 religious rite and hence the order prohibiting such procession was not violative of the right of petitioners under Articles 25 and 26. In Commr. o f Police v Acharya Jagadishwarananda (2004) 12 SCC 809, the Apex Court (majority opinion) held that the performance of Tandava dance in public procession by Ananda Margis is not an essential or integral part of their religion and, thus, not a matter of religion within the meaning of Arts. 25 and 26. The test to determine whether a part or practice is essential to a religion is to find out whether nature of the religion will be changed without that part or practice, Clause (2)(b) - Under this clause, State can eradicate social practices (viz. bigamy and polygamy under Hindu law) and dogmas which stand in the path of the country’s onward progress. Such laws do not affect the essence of any religion. This sub-clause ensures an individual’s legal right to enter into a temple unobstructed irrespective of his caste, untouchability, social inequality, etc. Art. 26: Freedom to M anage Religious Affairs Subject to public order, morality and health, every religious denomination or any section thereof shall have the right: (a) to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes, (b) to manage its own affairs in matters of religion, (c) to own and acquire movable and immovable property, and, (d) to administer such property in accordance with law. While, right guaranteed by Art. 25 is an individual right, the right guaranteed by Art. 26 is the right of an ‘organized body’. The word ‘religious denomination’ in Art. 26 must satisfy three conditions: (1) It must be a collection of individual who have a system of beliefs which they regard as conducive to their spiritual well being i.e. a common faith. (2) It must have a common organization. (3) It must be designated by a distinctive name. Thus, in a large sense, ‘Hinduism’, ‘Muslims’, ‘Christians’ are such denominations. In limited sense, the various philosophers governing the Hindu society such as Advaitas, Saivites, etc. are also denominations. Among Mohammedans, Hanafi, Shia or Chisti sects are separate denominations. Also, maths or the spiritual fraternity (a section of denomination) represented by it comes within this Article (LT Swamiar's case). Under Art. 26 (b), the court has a right to determine whether a particular rite or ceremony is regarded as essential by the tenets of a particular religion. The right is also subject to the regulatory powers of State under Art. 25 (2) (b) (Saifuddin Saheb v State of Bombay AIR 1962 SC 853). Constitution/Constitutional Law 55 The right of a religious denomination to manage its property (Cls. (c) and (d) of Art. 26) has been placed on a different footing from the right to manage its own affairs in matters of religion. The latter is a fundamental right which can’t be taken away except on grounds mentioned in Art. 25, the former can be regulated by laws which the Legislature can validly impose e.g. general property law. Also, Art. 26(c) is to be read subject to State’s power to acquire private property under Art. 31. Thus, property of a denomination can be acquired by State. In Rati Lai v State o f Bombay (AIR 1954 SC 388) and Commr. HRE v L.T. Swamiar (AIR 1954 SC 282), held that the law must leave the right of administration of property to religious denomination itself subject to such regulation as to improve the administration. In S.R Mittal v Union of India (AIR 1983 SC 1), the Aurobindo Society and an international cultural township- Auroville were held not to be religious institutions or denomination. The teachings of Sri Aurobindo only represented his philosophy and not a religion. In Bramchari Sidheswar Shai v State of W.B. (1995) 4 SCC 646 (“.Ramakrishna Mission case”), held that the followers of Ramakrishna, who are collection of individuals, and who adhere to a system of beliefs, and who’ve an organization of definite name 'Ramakrishna Math or Mission’ can be regarded as a religious denomination within Hindu religion. In M. Ismail Faruqui v Union o f India (“Ayodhya Case”) the court held that the right to practice, profess and propagate religion under Art. 25 does not necessarily include the right to acquire or own or possess property. While offer of prayer or worship is a religious practice, its offering at every location where such prayers can be offered would not be an essential or integral part of such religious practices unless the place has a particular significance for that religion so as to form an essential or integral part thereof. In ERJ Swaml v State ofT.N. (AIR 1972 SC 1586), the T.N. Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Act, 1970 was questioned on the ground that it violated Articles 25 and 26 (i.e. by purporting to introduce social reforms in the matter of appointment of Archakas and pujaris, the State has really interfered with the religious faith and practices of saivite and vaishnavite temples). Held that Archaka is not regarded as a spiritual head, but rather a ‘servant’ subject to the disciplinary power of the trustee. He owes his appointment to a secular authority. The purposes of the Act are essentially secular, and not intended to effect a change in the rituals and ceremonies followed in temples. Art. 27: Freedom Not to Pay Taxes for Religious Promotion Art. 27 says that no person shall be compelled to pay any taxes for expenses on promotion or maintenance of any particular religion i.e. there could be no objection if the taxes were used for the promotion of all religions. Art. 28: Freedom Not to Attend Religious Instructions Art.

The purposes of the Act are essentially secular, and not intended to 
effect a change in the rituals and ceremonies followed in temples. Art. 27: Freedom Not to Pay Taxes for Religious Promotion
Art. 27 says that no person shall be compelled to pay any taxes for expenses on 
promotion or maintenance of any particular religion i.e. there could be no objection if the
taxes were used for the promotion of all religions. Art. 28: Freedom Not to Attend Religious Instructions
Art. 28 prohibits religious instructions in educational institution wholly maintained by the State. In case of other institutions recognized and aided by the State, there will be freedom for every person not to participate in religious instruction or worship. In Aruna Roy v Union o f India (2002) 7 SCC 368 (“The Textbook Case”) (“New Education Policy Case”), the Supreme Court upheld the validity of National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCFSE) rejecting the petitioner’s contention that it was an attempt to “saffronise” education by the BJP led N.D.A. Government. It held that an 56 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations emphasis in, about requirement of “education about religions”, their basics, the values inherent therein and also comparative study of the philosophy of all religions is neither violative of Art. 28 nor offends against secularism. The court observed: The entire emphasis in Art. 28 is against imparting ‘religj0lls instructions’ (teaching rituals, customs, etc.). There is no prohibition for having study 0f religious philosophy and culture, particularly for having value-based social life in a society which is degenerating for power, post or property. Secularism is the basic structure o f the Constitution. “Secularism” has a positive meaning that is developing understanding and respect towards different religions (“religious pluralism”). The essence of secularism is non-discrimination of people by the State on the basis of religious differences. Art. 28 ( 1) does not prohibit introduction of study of religions in the State educational institutions including those wholly or partially aided by the State. After the National Education Policy of 1986, a shift by the impugned National Education Policy, 2002 towards teaching of religions in the schools to educate children to understand common factors in all religions, is not a non-secular step. ARTICLES 29-30: Rights to Minorities (Cultural and Educational Rights) The word “minority” is not defined in the Constitution. Whether a section of citizens constitutes a “minority” for the purpose of Arts. 29 and 30 in a State must be determined by reference to the entire population of the State. It refers to any community which is numerically less than 50% of the entire population of State. A minority could not be determined in relation to entire population of the country. In Frank Anthony Public School Employees Association v UOI (AIR 1987 SC 311) the Supreme Court observed: “The idea of giving special rights to minorities is not to have a kind of a privileged or pampered section of the population but to give them a sense of security and feeling of confidence”. In Bal Patil v Union o f India (AIR 2005 SC 3172), the Apex Court examined the scope and definition of the term “Minorities”. It observed that though not specifically defined, “minority” as understood from the constitutional scheme signifies an identifiable group of people or community who were seen as deserving protection from a likely deprivation of their religious, cultural and educational rights by other communities who happened to be in a majority and likely to gain power in a democratic form of government based on election. The constitutional ideal, which can be gathered from the group of articles in the Constitution under the chapters of fundamental rights and fundamental duties, is to create social conditions where there remains no necessity to shield or protect rights of a minority or majority. Art. 29: Protection of Interest of Minorities (1) Any section o f the citizens residing in the territory o f India or any part thereof having a distinct language, script or culture o f his own shall have the right to conserve the same. (2) No citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the State or receiving aid out o f State funds on grounds only o f religion, race, caste, language or any o f them. Constitution/Constitutional Law 57 A minority community can effectively conserve its language, script or culture by and through educational institutions, as what is conferred by Art. 29(1). Art. 29(2) is quite general and applies to all citizens, whether they belong to majority or minority groups. Therefore, a school run by minority, if it is aided by State funds, cannot refuse admission to boys of other communities. Also, the State cannot direct such school to restrict admissions to their own community. However, nothing in Art. 29(2) shall prevent the State from making reservations for backward classes under Art. 15. Art. 30: Right o f Minorities to Establish and Adm inister Educational Institutions (1) All minorities, whether based on religion or language, shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions o f their choice. (2) The State shall not, in granting aid to educational institutions, discriminate against any educational institution on the ground that it is under the management o f a minority. The right is conferred by this clause on two types of minorities: religious and linguistic. The word “establish” indicates the right to bring into existence, while the right to “administer■” means the right to effectively manage and conduct the affairs of institution. The ‘right to administer’ means the right to effectively manage and conduct the affairs of institution. The right to administer is said to consist of four principal matters: right to choose its managing or governing body, right to choose its teachers who have compatibility with the aims and aspirations of institution, right to admit students of their choice subject to reasonable regulations about academic qualifications, and, right to use its properties and assets for benefit of institution (St.
----------------------------------------
The ‘right to 
administer’ means the right to effectively manage and conduct the affairs of institution. The 
right to administer is said to consist of four principal matters: right to choose its managing 
or governing body, right to choose its teachers who have compatibility with the aims and 
aspirations of institution, right to admit students of their choice subject to reasonable 
regulations about academic qualifications, and, right to use its properties and assets for 
benefit of institution (St. Xaviers College v State o f Gujarat AIR 1971 SC 1389). However, right to administer is not an absolute right. The right to administer is not the right to maladminister (Re Kerala Education Bill case). The regulatory measures aimed at making minority institutions effective instruments for imparting education, without nullifying management’s right in substantial measures, are permissible (Frank Anthony Public School Employees Association case). The following regulatory measures are held to be permissible: measures which regulate the educational standards, the course of study, the qualifications and appointment of teachers, the conditions of the employment of employees, safeguards which must be observed before removal of employees, the academic qualifications for admission of students, health and hygiene of students, facilities for libraries and labs, etc. (All Saints High School v State o f A.P. AIR 1980 SC 1042). A minority institution cannot prescribe qualifications for admission of students, but can prescribe procedure for admission of students. In St. Stephen s College v University o f Delhi ((AIR 1992 SC 1630), held that the “interview” is an integral part of the college’s administration. The University cannot direct the college to dispense with its admission programme in the absence of proof of maladministration of the college. Also, held that minority aided institutions may reserve up to 50% seats for their community candidates and aw entitled to prefer them in admissions as it is necessary to maintain the minority character of institutions. In St. Xavier College case, held that minority institutions have no fundamental right to affiliation, but to deny affiliation or recognition except upon certain terms and conditions 58 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations amount to the surrender of their right to administer under Art. 30( 1). When a minor- institution applies to a university for affiliation, it expresses its choice to participate'^ the system of general education. Affiliation is for regulating the educational character an*1 content of minority institutions. Relationship between Art. 29(1)/ (2) and Art. 30(1) In St. Xavier College case, held that Art. 30(1) covers institutions imparting genera! secular education. Articles 29 and 30 create two separate rights though it is possible ti,al the rights might meet in a given case. The court pointed out the following distinctions between two Articles: (i) Art. 29(1) confers right on any section of citizens, thus including majority; An 30(1) confers right only on religious or linguistic minorities. (ii) Art. 29(1) is concerned with only three subjects viz. language, script or culture- Art. 30(1) deals with minorities based on language or religion. (iii) Art. 29(1) is concerned with right to conserve language, etc.; Art. 30(1) deals with right to administer educational institutions. (iv) Art. 29(1) does not deal with education as such; Art. 30(1) dqals only with establishment and administration of educational institutions. Thus, conservation of language, script or culture under Art. 29(1) may be by means wholly unconnected with the educational institutions and similarly, establishment and administration of educational institutions under Art. 30(1) may be unconnected with any motive to conserve language, script or culture. In St. Stephen’s College case, the court observed: “It is necessary to mediate between Art. 29(2) and Art. 30(1), between letter and spirit of these Articles, between traditions of past and the convenience of the person, between society’s need for stability and its need for change.” Recent Case Law In T.M.A. Pai Foundation v State o f Karnataka (2002) 8 SCC 481, an II -Judge Constitution Bench (6:5 majority) held that minority communities have an untrammelled right to establish and administer unaided educational institutions, while the institutions which receive State aid could be subject to Government rules and regulations. In respect of ‘unaided’ institutions, the only regulation a State Government or University can make is regarding the qualifications and minimum conditions of eligibility in the interest of academic standards. The State can make no laws regarding admissions or fees in such institutions. A minority institution does not cease to be so, the moment grant-in-aid is received. An aided institution will be entitled to have the right of admission of students belonging to the minority group. At the same time, it would be required to admit a reasonable extent of non-minority students, so that the rights under Art. 30 (I) are not substantially impaired and further, citizen’s rights under Art. 29 (2) are not infringed. The Apex Court also ruled that the basic ratio in the St. Stephen’s case (reservation of 50 per cent of the seats in aided institutions to the management’s discretion) is correct, however, rigid percentage cannot be stipulated. The Court empowered States to fix quotas for minority students taking into account the type of institution, population and educational needs of the minorities. The Court reiterated that the constitutional rights conferred on Constitution/Constitutional Law 59 minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice is not absolute or above other laws. The court also held as “unconstitutional” the Scheme framed by the Apex Court in the Unnikrishnan s case viz. fixing ‘free’ and ‘payment’ seats. The court lifted the regulation on fees to be charged by unaided institutions with the proviso that there would not be “profiteering”. Reasonable surplus to meet the cost of expansion and augmentation of facilities does not, however, amount to profiteering.
----------------------------------------
A five-judge Bench of the Supreme Court in Islamic Academy o f Education v State o f Karnataka (2003) 6 SCC 697, clarifying the doubts read in T.M.A. Pai Foundation case (majority decision), has directed the constitution of a separate committee in each State, to be headed by a retired judge of the High Court, to approve the fee structure of the institutions conducting medical and engineering courses and to ensure that the tests conducted for admission by these institutions were fair and transparent. In fixing percentage of quota for students to be admitted by the Management of unaided minority professional colleges, the State would keep in mind, apart from local needs, the paramount interest/ need of that community in the State. In Modern School v UOI (AIR 2004 SC 2236), it was held that in determination of the fee structure, unaided educational institutions exercise a great autonomy as they are entitled to generate a reasonable surplus for development of education and expansion of the institution itself. What is prohibited is commercialization of education/profiteering and the diversion of the profit/surplus for any other use or purposes and the use thereof for personal gains or for other business or enterprise. Hence a balance has to be struck between autonomy of such institutions and measures to be taken to prevent commercialization of education. In PA. Inamdar v State o f Maharashtra (2005) 6 SCC 537, the Apex Court clarified some issues raised in T.M.A. Pai case (2002) 8 SCC 481 and Islamic Academy case (2003) 6 SCC 697, relating to rights of professional unaided (minority and non-minority) educational institutions. It held: Each minority institution is entitled to have its own fee structure subject to the condition that there can be no profiteering and capitation fees cannot be charged. To check profiteering and capitation fees, the method of admission has to be regulated so that admissions are based on merit. Hence it is permissible to regulate admission and fee structure for achieving the same. Minority institutions stand on a better footing than non-minority institutions. State legislation cannot favour non-minority institutions over minority institutions. The difference arises because of Art. 30, the protection whereunder is available to minority institutions only. The unaided professional institutions will have full autonomy in their administration, but the principle of merit cannot be sacrificed, as excellence in professions is in the national interest. The court, however, clarified that neither can the policy of reservation be enforced by the State nor can any quota or percentage of admissions be carved out to be appropriated by the State in a minority or non-minority unaided educational institution. The State cannot insist on private educational institutions which receive no aid from the State to implement the State’s policy on reservation for granting admission on lesser percentage of marks i.e. on any criterion except merit. There is nothing in T.M.A. Pai case (2002) 8 SCC 481 which permits the same. Such State imposition would constitute a serious encroachment on the right and autonomy of private professional institutions and also cannot be held to be a 60 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations regulatory measure in the interest of the minority within the meaning of Art. 30(1) 0r reasonable restriction within the meaning of Art. 19(6) of the Constitution. In Naresh Agarwal v Bharat (2006), the petitioners (Hindu Students) were denied admissions to Post Graduate Medical Courses in Aligarh Muslim University (A.M.U.) f0r the 2005-06 Session. They challenged the validity of rule which declared the A.M.U a minority institution and allowed 50 per cent reservation to Muslim students. The Allahabad High Court held that A.M.U. was not a minority institution. The court struck down the amendment made to this effect in the statute of A.M.U. for reservation to Muslim Students. The court followed the Aziz Basha v UOI case wherein the Supreme Court had held that Aligarh University was established by an Act of Parliament, not by any Muslim ARTICLE 31: Right to Property and Saving of Certain Laws The ‘Right to Property’ has proved to be the most complicated and controversial. The consensus was embodied in Art. 19 (0 and Art. 31. But, the 44th Amendment, 1978 repealed these Articles completely with effect from 20 June 1979. Instead, in Part XII of the Constitution, a new Chapter IV and a new Art. 300-A was added to provide that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law. Thus, the “right to property” ceases to be a fundamental right but still remains a legal right. Art. 300-A gives protection against executive action but not against legislative action. Notwithstanding the repeal of Art. 31, Art. 31 -A (added by the 1st Amendment, 1951 and amended by the 4th, 17th, and 44th Amendment), Art. 31-B (added by the 1st Amendment, 1951) and Art. 31-C (added by the 25th Amendment, 1971 and amended by 42nd and 44th Amendments) remain part of the Fundamental Rights. Art. 31-A saves certain laws providing for acquisition of estates etc. from being questioned on grounds of inconsistency with Arts. 14 and 19. Art. 31-B saves certain Acts and Regulations listed in the 9th Schedule from being challenged on the ground of inconsistency with any of the Fundamental Rights. Art. 31-C saves certain laws giving effect to Directive Principles from being questioned and invalidated on grounds of inconsistency with Arts. 14 and 19. ARTICLES 32-35: Right to Constitutional Remedies See Art. 32 under the ‘Supreme Court and High Courts’. Article 33 empowers Parliament to modify the application of Fundamental Rights to the Armed Forces or forces charged with maintenance of public order, etc. in the interest of discharge of duties and maintenance of discipline. Though the appellate jurisdiction of courts is excluded in cases of court martial, the writ jurisdiction remains (unless taken away by law under Art. 33). Under Art. 34, Parliament may by law indemnify any person for anything done in contravention of fundamental rights for maintenance of order during the operation of martial law. Art.

in the interest 
of discharge of duties and maintenance of discipline. Though the appellate jurisdiction 
of courts is excluded in cases of court martial, the writ jurisdiction remains (unless taken 
away by law under Art. 33). Under Art. 34, Parliament may by law indemnify any person for anything done in 
contravention of fundamental rights for maintenance of order during the operation of 
martial law. Art. 35 lays down that the power to make laws to give effect to certain specified fundamental rights shall vest only in the Parliament and not in State Legislatures. Constitution/Constitutional Law 61 [B] Directive Principles of State Policy The Directive Principles of State Policy contained in Part IV of the Constitution (Arts. 36- 51) set out the aims and objectives to be taken up by the States in the governance of the country. The idea of ‘welfare State’ envisaged by our Constitution can only be achieved if the States endeavour to implement them with a high sense of moral duty. The real importance of Directive Principles is that they contain positive obligation of State towards its citizens. They are the ideals which the Union and State Governments must keep in mind while they formulate or pass a law. The Directive Principles constitute a very comprehensive political, social and economic programme for a modem democratic State. The main object in enacting them appear to have been to set standards of achievements before the legislature and the executive, the local and other authorities, by which their success or failure can be judged. Sanctions behind the Directive Principles are based on sound constitutional and moral obligations. Constitutional obligations are secured by having Directive Principles as an integral part of Constitution. The biggest moral force is public opinion which can enforce the Directive Principles and ensure government’s accountability at the time of elections. Thus, sanctions behind Directive Principles are political. Art. 37 of the Constitution lays down that it shall be the duty of State to apply these Directives in making laws. Articles 355 and 365 of the Constitution can be applied for enforcing implementation of Directive Principles. Classification of the Directive Principles (a) Social and Economic Charter (1) Social order based on justice - Art. 38(1) provides that the State shall strive to promote the welfare of people by securing and protecting a social order in which justice - social, economic and political - shall inform all the institutions of national life. Further, the State shall strive to minimize inequalities. (2) Economic justice - Art. 39 specifically requires the State to direct its policy towards securing the following principles: (a) Equal right of men and women to adequate means of livelihood. (b) Distribution of ownership and control of material resources of the community to the common good. (c) To ensure that the economic system should not result in concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment. (d) Equal pay for equal work for both men and women. (e) To protect health and strength of workers and tender age of children and to ensure that they are not forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their age or growth. (0 That children are given opportunities and facilities to develop in a healthy manner and in condition of freedom and dignity and that childhood and youth are protected against exploitation and against moral and material abandonment. 62 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations Articles 38 and 39 embody the principle of ‘distributive justice' which connotes the removal of economic inequalities rectifying the injustice resulting from transactions between unequals in society. In Randhir Singh v Union o f India (AIR 1982 SC 879), held that the principles of ‘equal pay for equal work’ (Art. 39(d)) though not a fundamental right is certainly a constitutional goal and, therefore, capable of enforcement through constitutional remedies under Art. 32. The right of tribals to social and economic empowerment is a fundamental right guaranteed under Art. 21 and Arts. 38,39 and 46 (Sama/Jia v State o f A.P. AIR 1997 SC 3297). (b) Social Security Charter (1) Participation o f workers in management o f industries - Art. 43-A. (2) Right to work, education and public assistance in cases o f unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement - Art. 41. (3) Just and human conditions o f work - Art. 42. (4) Living wage for workers - Art. 43‘. 'The concept of living wage includes in addition to the bare necessities of life (food, shelter and clothing), provisions for education of children and insurance, etc. (5) Free and compulsory education for children until they complete the age of 14 years - Art. 45. However, after the 86th Constitution Amendment Act, 2002, Art. 45 reads: "The State shall endeavour to provide early childhood care and education to children below the age o f 6 years.” (6) Duty to raise the standard o f living and improvement o f health -- Art. 47. It includes, in particular, the prohibition of liquor. (7) Promotion o f educational and economic interest o f weaker sections - Art. 46. (8) Equal justice and free legal aid to economically backward classes - Art. 39- A. In Centre o f Legal Research v State o f Kerala (AIR 1986 SC 1322), it has been held that in order to achieve the objectives in Art. 39-A, the State must encourage and support the participation of voluntary organizations in operating the legal aid programme. In State of Maharashtra v Manubhai Pragaji Vashi (1995) 5 SCC 730, held that under Art. 21 read with Art. 39-A casts on the State a duty to afford grants-in-aid to recognized private law colleges similar to other faculties e.g. Art, Science, etc. ‘Free legal aid’ and ‘speedy trial’ guaranteed under Art. 21 read with Art. 39-A are fundamental rights. (c) Community Welfare Charter (1) Uniform Civil Code - Art. 44.

(1) Uniform Civil Code -  Art. 44. While the State has tried to reform and codify the personal law of the Hindus (which is also applicable to Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists), no attempt has been made to bring the Muslims, Christians and Parsees under the purview of a common civil code. (2) Organization o f agriculture and animal husbandry - Art. 48. (3) Protection and improvement o f forest and wild life - Art. 48-A. (4) Protection o f monuments, etc. - Art. 49. Constitution/Constitutional Law 63 (5) Separation o f judiciary from executive - Art. 50. (6) Promotion o f international peace and security - Art. 51. Pursuant to the direction enshrined in Art. 51, Parliament passed the Protection o f Human Rights Act, 1993 which provides for the setting of a National Human Rights Commission and Human Rights Courts to meet the growing concern for human rights in the country and abroad. (7) Organization o f village panchayats - Art. 40. The object of this provision is to introduce democracy at the grass roots. Im plem entation and Utility of Directives Opinion differs on how far the Directives have been implemented in actual practice. In keeping with Directives, the main object of 5-year plans is to achieve a balanced economic development and to raise living standard of masses. As for the implementation of specific Directives, good progress has been made: (0 Land reforms, abolition of intermediaries and zamindari system. (ii) Organization of village panchayats; promotion of cottage industries; welfare of SC, ST, etc. (iii) Compulsory primary education achieved in most States. (iv) Minimum wages for workers; modernization of labour laws. (v) Hindu Marriage Act and Hindu Succession Act - for securing uniform civil code. The Directives are “moral precepts” for the authorities of State. They provide a middle way between individual liberty and public good. Dr. Ambedkar had said that these principles were not intended to be mere pious obligations; they are ‘instrument of instructions’ upon all future governments, irrespective of their party creeds. Directives have shaped the governmental policies and programmes. They are ‘fundamental in the governance of the country’ (Art. 37). Thus, they are not mere ‘moral precepts’, but are ‘positive mandates’. The courts are enforcing the Directives indirectly. In determining the Constitutional validity of legislation, they are given precedence over the Fundamental Rights. They are relevant to consider what are reasonable restrictions under Art. 19. In Sarla Mudgal v Union o f India (AIR 1995 SC 1531), the Supreme Court strongly recommended the need for a uniform civil code, declaring illegal the second marriage by a Hindu husband after conversion to Islam. The judges argued that religious practices, violative of human rights and dignity and sacerdotal suffocation of essentially civil and material freedoms, are not autonomy but oppression. The judges upheld the view that unified, progressive civil law would promote national unity and solidarity and safeguard the interests o f the weaker and oppressed sections. The court observed that Art. 44 sought to divest religion from social relations and personal laws. Marriage, succession and like matters of a secular character cannot be brought within the guarantees under Articles 25 and 26 of Constitution. The legislature is within its rights to supersede or supplement this personal law by a uniform civil code. In John Vallamatton v UOI (AIR 2003 SC 2902), the Supreme Court reiterated that a ‘Common Civil Code’ (Art. 44) would enhance the cause of national integration by removing the contradictions based on ideologies. 64 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations Relation between Directive Principles and Fundam ental Rights The Directive Principles differs from Fundamental Rights in certain respects: (1) The Directives are non-justiciable i.e. can’t be enforced by the courts; they are declaratory. While Fundamental Rights are justiciable i.e. can be enforced b courts; they are mandatory. (2) The Directives are instrument of instructions to the Government, they contain positive commands to the State to promote a social and welfare State. The Fundamental Rights are limitations upon the State actions, they contain negate injunctions to the State not to do various things. (3) Unlike Fundamental Rights, the Directives are required to be implemented by legislation. (4) The courts cannot declare as void any law which is otherwise valid on the ground that it contravenes any of the Directives. On the other hand, the courts are bound to declare as void any law that is inconsistent with fundamental rights. The place the Directive Principles occupy in the Constitution vis-^-vis the Fundamental Rights has been a subject matter of controversy for a long time, which has been set at rest: (i) In State o f Madras v Champakam Doraitajan (AIR 1951 SC 228), held that the Directive Principles cannot override the Fundamental Rights. (ii) In Re Kerala Education Bill (AIR 1957 SC 956), the court observed that though the Directive Principles cannot override the Fundamental Rights, neveitheless, in determining the scope and ambit of Rights the court may not entirely ignore the Directives but should adopt the principles of harmonious construction and should attempt to give effect to both as much as possible. (iii) 25th Amendment, 1971 considerably enhanced the importance of Directives. Art. 31-C, added by it, provided that a law for implementing Directives contained in Art. 39 (b) and (c) could not be struck down on the ground that it contravened rights conferred by Articles 14 and 19. (iv) 42nd Amendment, 1976 widened the scope of Art. 31-C so as to cover all Directive Principles. Thus, it gave precedence to all the Directives over the Fundamental Rights - Arts. 14 and 19.

Art. 31-C, added by it, provided that a law for implementing Directives 
contained in Art. 39 (b) and (c) could not be struck down on the ground 
that it contravened rights conferred by Articles 14 and 19. (iv) 42nd Amendment, 1976 widened the scope of Art. 31-C so as to cover all 
Directive Principles. Thus, it gave precedence to all the Directives over the 
Fundamental Rights -  Arts. 14 and 19. (v) In Keshavananda Bharati v Union o f India (AIR 1978 SC 1461), the court observed that the Fundamental Right: and Directive Principles are meant to supplement one another. It can well be said that the Directives prescribed the goal to be attained and Fundamental Rights lay down the means by which that goal is to be achieved. (vi) In Minerva Mills v Union o f India (AIR 1980 SC 1789), the court struck down Art. 31 -C as amended by 42nd amendment as unconstitutional on the ground that it destroys the “basic features” of the Constitution. The majority observed that the Constitution is founded on the bedrock of the balance between Part III and IV. To give absolute primacy to one over the other is Conslitution/Constitutional Law 65 to disturb the harmony of the Constitution which is the essential feature of the basic structure. j' (vii) In State ofT.N. v Abu Kavur Bai (AIR 1984 SC 626) a five-judge Bench held I that although the Directives are not enforceable yet the court should make a real attempt at harmonizing and reconciling the Directives and the Rights and any collision between the two should be avoided as far as possible. The reason why the founding fathers of our Constitution did not make these principles enforceable was, the court said, perhaps due to the vital consideration of giving the government sufficient latitude to implement these principles from time to time according to capacity, situation and circumstances that may arise. (viii) In Unni Krishnan v State o f A.P. (1993) 1 SCC 645, the court has reiterated the same principle that the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles are supplementary and complementary to each other and the provisions in Part 111 should be interpreted having regard to the preamble and Directive Principles. Conclusions - There is no conflict or disharmony between Directive Principles and Fundamental Rights, because they supplement each other in aiming at the same goal of bringing about a social revolution and establishment of a welfare State. As described by Granville Austin, the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles are the “Conscience o f our Constitution”. In State o f Gujarat v Mirzapur Moti Qureshi Kassab Jamet (AIR 2006 SC 212), it was held that when faced with the question of testing the constitutional validity of any statutory provision or an executive act, or for testing the reasonableness of any restriction cast by law on the exercise of any fundamental right by vfay of regulation, control or prohibition, the Directive Principles of State Policy and Fundamental Duties as enshrined in Art. 51-A plays a significant role. [C] FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES Fundamental Duties are incorporated in Part IV-A, which consists of only one Art. 5 1-A, added by 42nd Amendment, 1976. It says that it shall be the duty of every citizen of India (there are eleven such duties, after the 86th Constitution Amendment Act, 2002): (a) to abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the National Flag and National Anthem, (b) to cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our national struggle for freedom, (c) to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and .integrity of India, (d) to defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so. (e) to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities; to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women, (f) to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture. 66 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations (g) to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wild life, and to have compassion for living creature, (h) to develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform, (i) to safeguard public property and to abjure violence, (j) to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievements, and Of) who is parent or guardian, to provide opportunities for education to his child or ward between the age of 6 and 14 years (inserted by the 86th Constitution Amendment Act, 2002). The new Chapter on Fundamental Duties is “the palm embodying noble ideals, rhythm, harmony with the impress of the hand of the Prime Minister”. Verma Committee on Fundamental Duties (1999) noted: “Essentially all that is contained in the Fundamental Duties is just a codification of tasks integral to the Indian way of life”. Significance o f Duties - Rights and Duties are correlative. Mahatma Gandhi defined right as “duty well performed”. The fundamental duties (‘code of conduct’) are intended to serve as a constant reminder to every citizen that while the Constitution specifically conferred on them certain fundamental rights, it also requires citizens to observe certain basic norms of democratic conduct and democratic behaviour. Fundamental duties are confined to “citizens”, unlike Fundamental rights like Art. 21 which extends to “all persons”. The fundamental duties seek to limit the operation of fundamental rights- a countervailing factor and a warning to reckless citizens against anti-social activities like destroying public property, burning national flag, and the like. It is significant to note that none of the Constitution of western countries specifically provides the duties and obligations of citizens. However, the Constitution of socialist countries lay great emphasis on the citizens’ duties. Enforcement o f Duties - The duties incorporated in the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment are statutory duties and shall be enforceable by law.

It is significant to note that 
none of the Constitution of western countries specifically provides the duties and 
obligations of citizens. However, the Constitution of socialist countries lay great emphasis 
on the citizens’ duties. Enforcement o f Duties -  The duties incorporated in the Constitution by the 42nd 
Amendment are statutory duties and shall be enforceable by law. Parliament, by law, will provide penalties to be imposed for failure to fulfill those duties and obligations. A court in determining the constitutional validity of any law seeking to give effect to duties, may consider law to be ‘reasonable’ in relation to Art. 14 or 19. In M.C. Mehta v Union o f India (1983) I SCC 471, held that under Art. 5I-A(g) it is the duty of the Central Government to introduce compulsory teaching of lessons at least for one hour in a week on protection and improvement of natural environment in all educational institutions. In AIIMS Students' Union v MIMS (AIR 2001 SC 3262), the Supreme Court said that the Fundamental duties are equally important like Fundamental rights, though the former are unenforceable. Both are prefixed by the same word “fundamental”. Every citizen of India is fundamentally duty-bound to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievements. The duty of evety citizen of India is the collective duty of the State. The court observed: Fundamental duties provide a valuable guide and aid to interpretation of Constitution (e.g. determination of reasonableness of reservation) and legal issues. In case of doubt or Constitution/Constitutional Law 67 choice, people’s wish as manifested through Art. 51-A, can serve as a guide riot only for resolving the issue but also for constructing or moulding the relief to be given by the courts. Recently, the ‘National Commission on the Review of the Constitution’ examined the operationalization of fundamental duties of the citizens and gave their considered recommendations. In UOI v R. Padmanabhan JT 2003 (7) 206, the Supreme Court has directed the Central Government to take appropriate steps for the implementation of the recommendations of the NCRC as expeditiously as possible. Fundamental Duties are a mixed bag of expectations and exhortations - A number of duties (clauses a, c and d) are enforceable today without specific incorporation in the Constitution. 4. THE EXECUTIVE (PRESIDENT/GOVERNOR, PRIME MINISTER) President is the executive head of India, while the Governor of a State. The position and powers of the two are more or less similar. Election of the President The President is elected by an electoral college, in accordance with the ‘system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote by secret ballot.’ The electoral college consists of (a) elected members of both Houses of Parliament, and (b) elected members of Legislative Assemblies of States (Art 54). Two cardinal principles in this regard are: (a) There shall be uniformity of representation of the different States at the election and parity shall be maintained between the States'as a whole and the Union (Art. 55), and (b) the vote of the States, in the aggregate, in the electoral college for the election of the President, shall be equal to that of the people of the country as a whole. A person who has ten proposers and ten seconders [Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Act, 1952] can be nominated as a candidate for President’s election. President’s election cannot be prevented or suspended on the ground that any vacancy exists in the._ electoral college electing him viz. when a State Assembly has been dissolved uhder Art. 356 andJts members are unable to participate in the election. The term of office of President is 5 years and he is eligible for re-election. Chief Justice of India or in his absence the senior-most Judge of the Supreme Court administers oath or affirmation to the President. Qualifications for Election as President The Constitution lays down both positive as well as negative qualifications: Positive Qualifications: A person must (Art. 58) - (i) be a citizen of India, (ii) have completed the age of 35 years, and
