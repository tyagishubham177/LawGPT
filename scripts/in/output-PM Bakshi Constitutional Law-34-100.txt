PARTIn PUNDAMENT AL RIGHTS 12. Delinition.-In this Part. unless the context otherwise required. "the State" includes the Government and Parliament of India and the Government and the Legisla- tUfe of each of the States and all local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India. Notes on Article 12 StIJU aclion The historical context in which the doctrine of "Stale action" evolved in the U.S. is irrelevant fot India. But the principle behind the doctrine (State aid, control and regulation so impregnating a private activity as to give it the colour of "State action'') is of interest 10 us to the limited extent 10' which it can be indianised and harmoniously blended with out constitutional jurisprudence; M.e.

The definition of "State" is nol confined 10 a Government Department and the Legislature, bul extends to any action-administrative (whether statutory or non- statulo!y). judicial' or quasi-judi_. cial, which can be brought within the fold of 'State action' being action which violates a fundamen- tal right.

The main theory evolved is that of "instrumentaJity or agency" of Govemmenl. ThiJ is a concept wider than a "department of the Government". It embrace5 every public authority exercising stall.!- lOry powen, every authority created under stabJe and even a non-swulmy authority exercising public functions.

What is, and what is not a "State" has been the subject. matter of rich case law under anicle 12, From the numerous decisions on the subject, a judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court has culled out certain propositions; B. HassCUI Ali Khan v. Director ofHig~r Educatiofl, A.P., (1987) 4 Reports 198 (A.P.), decided on 23rd January, 19!i7 (Writ Petition No. 3065 of 1978). Thejudg. ment says th?L the essentialtesl5 to dctcnnine whether a particular inseitution is "other authority" within the meaning of anicle 12 are substantial financial aid, control by the Government, perform- ance of public functions and entrustment of governmental activities. All of these are not essential, and. in a particular case, one ()I" a combination of more than one of them may suffice. In the leading case of Ajay Hasia v. KhaliJ Mujib, 1981 SC 481 (Registeml Society). the Regional Engineering College was held to be a "State". P.N. Bhagwati, J. observed as under in that case- '''The constitutional philosophy of a democratic socialist republic requires the Government to undertake a multitude of socio-economic operations and the Government, having· regard to the practical advantages of functioning through the Legal device of a corporation embarks on myriad commercial and economic activities by resorting to the insuumemality or agency of a corporation, but this contrivance of carrying on such activities through a corporation cannot exonemle the GoYernment from il5 basic obligation to respect the Fundamental Rights and nO( to override t~. 1be mandate of a corporation may be adopted in order to free the: Government from the inevitable constrains of red· tapism and slow motion but by doing so, the Government cannot be allowed 10 play truant with the basic human rights. Otherwise, il would be tbe easiest thing for the Government 10 assign 10 a plurality of corporations almost every State business such as Posl and Telegraph, TV and Radio, Rail Road and Tdepboncs·in short every economic activity.and lhereby cheat the people of India out of Ihe Fundamental Rights guaranteed 10 them." In the above judgment of the Sups:eme Coun Mr. Justice 8hapati enunciated the following test for determining whether an<ntity is an instrumc;ntality or agency of the State:- "(I) One thing is clear that if the entire share capiial of the corporation is held by Government, it would go a long way lowarth indicating that the corporation is an instrumentality or agency or Government. (2) Where th, financial assistance of the Slate is so much as to meet almost entire expenditure of the corporatjon, it would afford some indication of the corporation being impregnated with governmental ,iharacter. (3) It may also be a relevant factor whether the corporation enjoys monopoly seatus which is the Sate conferred ()I" State protected. (4) Existenc~ of deep and pervasive Slate control may afford an indication that the corporation is a Slate agency or insuumentalily.

(5) If the functions of the corporation of public importance and closdy related to governmental functions, it would be a relevant factor in classified the corporation as a instrumentality or agency of Government.

The Secretary, Children Aid Society, AIR 1987 SC 656 (P.N. Bhagwali, C.J. and R.S. Pathak, J.). The Rajasthan Stale Electricity Board is 'State' within the meaning of that expression used in article 12 of the Constitution so that is amendable to the writ jurisdiction under article 226 of the Constitution. For the same reason. it is obvious that if a case of violation of a right under article 14 of the Constitution is made out by the petitioner against the Board, then there would be no impediment in granting relief under article 226 of the Constitution; D.C.M. Ltd v. AssistQllt Engineer (H.M.T. Sub· division), Rajasthan Stote Ekclriciry Boord, Kala, AIR 1988 Raj 64. Thert: are tests formulated by several cases of the Supreme Court to find out whether an institu- tion is a "State". There cannot indeed be a straight jacket formula. It is not necessary that all the tests should be satisfied or reaching the conclusion either for or against holding an institution to be "State". In a given case, some of the features may emerge so boldly and prominently that a second view may not be possible. There may yet be other cases where the matter would be on the border line and it would be difficult to take one or other view outright; Tdraj v. Union of India, AIR 1988 SC 469. Pri.Qle BodJ A private body which is an agency of the State may be a "Slate "; Star Ellterprises v. City and Industrinl Development Corpn. of Maharastra, (1990) 3 SCC 280. Co-operati"es 1be Co-operativt SocieOes are not created oy the eo.. operative Societies Act and they are not statutory bodies. They are only functioning in accordance with the provisions ofthe Act. Moreover, the Government has no share3 in the Co-operative Societies. There is no deep and prevasive State Control. The management of the societies does not vest in the Government, or in the representatives of the Government Bank. The management is, under the effective control of committee elected by the members of the society. The stalUtory regulation or restriction in the functioning of the societies is not "an imprint of the State under anicle I r.

The first clause relates to the laws already existing in force and declares that pre-Constitution laws are void to the extent to which they 8re inconsistent with the fundamental lights. The second clause relates 10 post-Constitution laws and prohibits the Stale from making a law which either takes away totally or abrogates in part a fundamentals righl 1be expression ';he State" is to construed in conformity with anicle 12 as judicially interpreted.

The object of the definition in anicle 13 is to ensure that instruments emanating from any source of law-pem::menl or temporary, legislative or judgment or any other source-will pay homage to the constitutional provision relating 10 fundamental rights. At the same time, clause (4) seeks to ensure that a constitutional amendment does not fall within the definition of law in article 13, and its Validity cannot be challenged on the ground that il violate~ a fundamental right. But il should be noted that fundamental righls as such, while nol immune from constitutional amendment, may, in some cases, from part of the theory of basic fealures, enunciated in certain decisions by the Supreme Court. The chronology ofimponant of Supreme Coun decisions on the subject is as under. (i) Golak Nath v. Stau 0/ Punjab, AIR 1967 SC 1643. (ii) K~slw"anadn Blwrati v. StuU of K~rala, AIR 1973 SC 1461, which, while upholding the validity of the Constitution (24th Amendment) by which anicle 13(4) was insc:ned, laid down (by majority) the the{)ry thaI there were cenain basic fearures which could nOI be amended under the amending power.

Union of India, 1990 1 SCC613,661. &uk featurrl The "basic features" of the Constitution cannot be amended by exercising the power of amend· ment under article 368. The Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act, 1976, which inserted in article 368(5) a provision that there is no limita!ion on the constituent power of the Parliament to amend the Constitution, has been invalidated by the Supreme Court, adhering to the doctrine of basic features.

Right to EqIl4lit] 14, Equality hero.n law.-The Stale shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India. Notes on Article 14 Source: The source of article 14 lies in the American and the Irish Constitutions. h may be mentioned that the Preamble to the Indian Constitution speaks of equality of status and of opportun- ity and this article gives effect 10 that principle in the text of the Constitution. In a sense, the demand for equality is linked up with the history of the freedom movement in India. Indians wanted the same rights and previleges that their British masters enjoyed in India and the desire for civil rights was implicit in the fonnation of the Indian National Congress in 1885. The Commonwealth of India Bill. 1925, in clause 8 demanded, inter alia equality before the law and provided espeCially that there was to be "no disqualification or disability on the ground only of sex", along with the provi. sion that all persons were 10 have equal right to the use of "roads, courts of justice and all other places of business or resort dedicated to the public". See Chakravarty and Bhattacharya, Congress in Evolution, (1940), page 27. The right to equality finds place in the report drawn up by Motilal Nehru as Chairman of the Committee appointed to detennine principles of the Constitution for India (1928). The Karachi resolution (March 1931) reiterated. inreralia, this right in the resolution on fundamental rights and economic and social change. Chakravarty and Bhattacharya, Congress in Evolution. (1940) page 28. The Sapru report (1945) incorporating the proposals of the Sapru .6 Th~ Constitution of India Article 14 Committee. while laying emphasis on "minorities" did enunciate the fundamental rights and in page 260 of the report. described the fund;amentaJ rights of the proposed new Constitution as a standing warning 10 aIJ- ''that what the Constitution demands and cxpectS is perfect equality between one section of the community and another in the matter of political and civic rights. equality of liberty and security in the enjoyment of lIle freedom of religion. worship.

community and another in the matter of political and civic rights. equality of liberty and security 
in the enjoyment of lIle freedom of religion. worship. and the pursuit of the ordinary applica- tions of life." Scope: Article 14 is to be understood in Ihe light directive principles; Indra SawMt!y v. Union of India, AIR 1993 SC 447. Paragraph 4. limillllions : Broadly speaking, judicial decisions interpreting artide 14 while recognising the P{U'amounl nature sorthe fundamental rights, recognise,the need on considerations of reality 10 have certain limitations. It is often slated thai equality before the law guaranleed by the first pari of article 14, is a negative concept while the second part is a morc positi ... e concept. Neither part of the article is above the recognition of exceptions and qualifications on special grounds. Thus, while the first part which is mentioned by Dicey (Dicey, Law of the Constitution, 9th edition, page 202) 15 a ~ond corollary of the rule of law would rule OUt any special 'previlege' for any authority or person. But Constitution docs give cenain privileges to the President and the Governors (and also to Members of Parliament and Stale Lcgislaturcs). Morcover some of its provisions, as interpreted. result in a certain clement of discrimination. For example, the liability of the State in tort is even today in India not necessarily the same as the liability of any private employer. According to CUrTent theory, no suit lies againSlthe Government for an injury in the cour~e of exercise of the 'sovereign' functions of the Government; Stat~ of Rajasthan .... Vidyawati.

Similarly, in the statutory framework of India. one does unfonunately come ocross provisions which introduce or maintain a cenain amount of inequality between Government officers and ordin· ary citizens. For example for a suit against the Governmentifr against a Government officer [or an act purponing to be done by the laner in his official capacity a two month notice is ordinarily requim.:l under section 80 oftbe Code of Civil Procedurc, 1908. Similarly. where a public servant who is not removable from his office except by or with sanction of the Government. is accused of an offence committed by him while acting or purponing to act in the discharge of his official duties, criminal couns are barred from talc.ing cognizance of such an offence without previous sanction of the Central Government or the State Governrncnt. (as tbe case may be) under section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Th~ tnt: In detennining the validity of such provisions, couns in India have followed the general principle that equal protection of the laws means the right to equal treatment in similar circumsla"us, Couns have upheld legislation containing apparently discriminatory provisions where the discrimination is based on a reasonable basis. By 'reasonable', it is meant that the classification must not be arbitrary but must be rational. The classical test as judicially enunciated requires the fulfilment of two conditions, namely. (I) The classification must be founded on an intelligible differential which distinguishes those thai arc grouped together from others. (2) The differential must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achievod by the law under challenge. Judicial decisions laying down the imponant propositions on the: subject are the following ;- (i) Chiranjit wi v. Vllioll of India, (1950) SCR 869. (ill Sfal~ 0/ Wt'st Bt'llgal .... Allwar Ali.

Ext'culivt' Action Occasionally administrative action which violates equality comes up for SClutiny before the courts, Such action may be based on statute or may be purely e~ecutive action of an administrative nature, that is, of non-statutory character. In either case. a statutory or non-statutory order of the e~eculive which is arbitrary may be set aside. The courts here are not concerned with the validity of the parent law. but with the mode of its e~ercise of (in the second case) with the exercise of e~ecutive powers by the competent authority.

But it should be noted thai article 15 is limited to citizens, while article 14 extends to al1 persons. Secondly, article IS, clause (1) and anicle 15(2) are both limited to discrimination on the ground of religion, racC', sex, place of binh or any of them. Thirdly, the article permits the State to make special provisions for women and children. Fourthly, the article also permits the State to make any special provision for the fo!lowing :- (a) Socially and educationally backward classes of citizens; (h) Scheduled castes; and (e) Echeduled tribes. Article 14 prohibits the State from denying to any person equality before the law etc. Article 15(1) and article 16(2) project the citizen against discrimination; State of Siklcim v.

Another crucial word i~ 'only' 50 that jf the discrimination is based on some ground not connectl"1 with rcligiGn ctc. but with some other rational factor, the discrimination would be valid. Women Clause (3), which permiu special provision for women and children, has been widely resorted to and the courts have upheld the validity of special measures in legislation or eXCUltive orders favouring women. In panicular, provisions in the criminal law, in favour of womcn, or in the proced!,~ law discriminiting in favour of women, have heen upheld.

mentioned therein. However. apart from questions as 10 when a particular class can be legitimately

Hence, reservation of an excessively high percentage of scats in technical institutions for each classes would be void. In fact, ordinarily speaking, reservation in excess of 50 per cem of available seats may not be upheld. The undermentioned decisions may be seen on this point: (i) Stat~ oj A.P. v.

Apart form Schedule Castes and Schedules Tribes, the other ctasses eligible or reservation, if made by the Slate, is the category of "socially and educationally backward classes of citizens", In article 46, (a directive principle of State policy) it is the obligation of the state to promote with special care the educational nnd economic interests of "the weaker sections of the people", and in particular. "of the Sheduled Castes 'and the Scheduled Tribes" which is provided for. By article 335, it is provided that the claim of the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes shan be taken into considertltion consistently with the maintenance of efficiency in the adminiuration, in the making of appointments to services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of a State. 8U1 this article does not mention backward classes. Virtually, the Supreme Court has held the dement of efficiency of adminiu111lion as a limitation on articte 16(4). Incidentally, article 16(4) speaks of reservation of appointment of posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which, in the opinion of the State, is not adtquately represented in the service under the State. But this article has to be interpreted in the background of article 335 as mentioned above. Undermentioned decisions may be seen on the above aspecl : (i) K.C. Vasanthkwnar v.

Notes on Article 19 
RdaJionship 
Article 19 is available against State action for the protection of freedoms enumerated in the 
article. Some controversy existed in the past as to whether the operation of Ihis article is ruled oul 
where articles 21 and 22 apply; but the current trend is nolto regard lhese articles as mutually 
exclusive. Thus 10 take one example. a pcrwn who!IC freedom of movement has/been taken away by imprisonment or detention does not thereby lose his freedom of expression, so long as it is exercised within the valid condilions reluting to imprisonment or detention. Uencc a detenue cannot be prevented from sending outside the jail for publication, matter which conlains nothing prejudicial 10 the grounds or which he had been detained.

Corporations lIS citizens The freedoms under article 19 are limited to citizens and if lilerally construed these freedoms would not be available to corporations, because corporations cannot be ullked of as having or possessing citizenship. Bul it has been held that shareholders can challenge the validity of a law on the ground of violation of their fundamental rights and the company may be joined in such proceeding with proper pleading.

Bunk,. 0/ Proof The scheme of article 19, broadly speaking, is that once a law primo facie violates a right guaranteed by any clause of the article. then the Stale must show how the legislation or other SlaW: action falls within the permissible limits allowed by clause (2) to (6) of the article and 10 place proper material to support that argument. The decisions in support of this proposition are the following:- (i) Vrijfalv.Sultt!ojM.P" AIR 1970SC 129.135. (ii) Sagi, Ahmad v. Swtt 0/ U.P., AIR 1954 SC 128. (iii) ChinlllmCUI Rao v. SUlre of M.P., (1950) SCR 759. Crittria of'tJ1idiJJ uj law The considetalions which generally prevail in judging the validity of a law in the context oflhis article are: (a) Whether the law imposes a restriction on the freedom in question; (b) Whether the restrictions have been imposed by law; (e) Whether the restrictions are reasonable; and (d) Whether Ihe restriction besides being reasonable, is imposed for one of the specified purposes relevanl 10 the freedom in question as enumerated in the applicable clause out of clauses (2) to (6) of the article. Each of these conditions must be satisfied. The tes' of nasolUlbkness In applying the test of reasonableness {which is the most crucial considetationl,lhe broad CritCf- ion is whdher the law ;>trikes a proper balance between social control on the one hand and the rights of the individual on the other hand. The court must takc into 3CCount the following aspects:- (a) nature of the right infringed: (b) underlying purpose of the restriction imposed: (e) evils soughllO be remedied by the law, its extent and urgency; (d) how far the restriction is or is not proportionate to the evil; and (d prevailing conditions at the lime.

Freedom of AnemblJ The freedom of assembly can be restricted for the purpose mentioned in article 19(3) by a reasonable law. Moreover, the freedom can be exercised only on public land. Restrictions imposed under article 19(3) would cover restrictions to maintain the sovereignily and integrity of India and public order. including the maintenance of traffic in the area concerned. But the restrictions cannot attain the SUtus of absolute prohibition at least in normal times. Ri,hJ to know A citizen has a right to know about the a.;:tivilies of the State. the instrumentalities. the departmcnt~ and the agencies of he State. The privilege of secrecy which existed in old times, (namely) that the Stilte is not bound to disclose the facts to the citizens or the State cannot be compelled by the citizens to disclose the facts, does not survive now to a great eltent. Under article 19 there exists the right of freedom of speech. Freedom of speech is based on the foundation of freedom right 10 know.

While judicial decisions confine this article to physical movement. the intangible aspect of freedom may receive protection under anicle 21.

They policy must be laid down on which the discretion is to be elercised. Further, in general, the discretion must be exercised on relevant consideration. In short, if the law imposing licensing does not set OUI the: consideration. the law would be void. If lbe considerations are set OUI in the law, but are departed from by the: competentl authority while administering the: law then the order of the competent aulhorily would be void. even though the law itself may be valid. Generally, an existing licence cannot be revoked without giving the licensee an opportunity of hearing. The undermentioned decisions bear out these propositions; (,) Dwarka Prasad v.

----------------------------------------
The Supreme Court has described the law 
relating to right of a company to challenge violation of anicle 19 as in a 'nebulous State' and added. Article 20 The Con.uirurion of India 35 the trend is in the direction of holding thai in the mancr of fundamental freedoms guar:lnteed by article 19, the rights of a sharesholder and the company which the sharesholdcrs have formed are rather co-cxtensive and the denial 10 one of the fundamental freedoms would be denied 10 the olher. h is time to put an end to this controversy; Ddhi Clolh &. Cenual Mills v. Union of /ndw. AIR 1974 SC 937, 943. Sec also 'Corpor:ltion as citizl!os' at page 29. 20. Prolection in respect of conviclion for offences.--{ I) No person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at Ihe lime of the commis· \ sion of the act charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been innicted under the law in force OIl the time of the commission of lhe offence. (2) No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once. (3) No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself. Noles on Article 20 Scope The prohibitions imposed by artide 20 are directly relevant to the criminal process. While clause (I) is concerned with the SUbslaOlive law of criminal liability and penalty, clauses (2) and (3) are concerned mainly with the stage of procedure. In the jurisprudence of oonstitutionallaw, ankle 20(1) incorporates a prohibition against 'ex POSI facto pt'na/ faw'. Article 20(2) incorporates a prohibition against 'double jeopardcy' article 20(3) gives protection against 'testimonial compulsion'. Because of the word 'person' used in each clause, the article must be regarded as applicable to a corponfion which is accused, prosecuted, convicted or punished for an offence; SiumnD v. Salish, (1954) SCR 1077. ThU5 article 20 is not confined to individuals aod common law offences. Vil'llatiDn oJ low and common low oJ/t'ncu Although clause (I) is mainly concerned with retroactive penal legislation, it also seems to give constitution recognition to the principle that there cannot be a conviction except for violalion of a 'law in force'. II would seem. therefore. that in India, then: can be no 'Common law' offences; and the judiciary cannot. in India. create an offence noc creatfd by statute. How far the wan! 'violation' would require that the violation should be personal, is a matter not specifically provided for in the anicle. The question must await judicial decisions at a later stage and anicle 21 may also be relevant. . No Ri,fht in Procedure It should be noted Ihal while substantive law imposing liability or penally cannot be altered to the prejudice of the person supposed to be guilty with retrospective effect, there is no vested right in procedure. Besides this, the thrust of article 20( I) is in the field of criminal law only, since the word 'offence' as defined in article 367 read with the General Clauses Act can only denote an act or omission punishable by law. Imponant decisions on the above aspect are the following :- (;) Shiv Bahadur v. State of U.P .. (1953) SCR 118. (;;) Kedar Nath v. SIDte ofW.B .. AIR 1953 SC 404. (iill lawala Ram v.

Double Jeopard] Article 20 As regards article 20(2) dealing with double jeopardy what it bars is 'prosecution and punishment after an earlier punishment for the same offence. 'Offence'here means an otTence as defined in section 3 (38) of the General Clauses Act applied 10 the Constitution by article 367. The offence must be the ~me.lhat is 10 say. involving the same ingredients in all respect and a trial for a separate and distinct offence is not barred under article 20(2). However. this article must be takcn as supplemented by section 26 of the General Gauses Act, 1897 and the provisions of the Code of Ciminal Procedure, 197) as to second prosecution after conviction or acquiUaI for an offence where the second persecution is excluded by the doctrine of au1r~fois convict or autufoic acquit. The word 'prosecution' would not normally cover depaiunental proceedings not held before a criminal court. The object of this provisions is to avoid the harassment which must be caused to a penon for successive criminal proceedings where only one crime has been committed. Important decisions interpreting this clause of article 20 arc the following :- (i) Makbool V. SUll~ (>f Bombay, (1953) SCR 730. (m Kalawati v. Sla/~ of H.P., (1953) SCR S46. (iiI) Stat~ of Bombay v.

TestimonitJI compUlsion for th, accused The protection against compulsion 'to be Jl witness' is confined to persons 'accused of an offence'. There is no con,;tituJionai protection for witncses (i.e. penons oliler lIIan the accused). However, the Evidence Act, in sections 132 and 148, confen 8 limited protection against self· incrimination to witness in civil and criminal courts. Important cases on the above limitation of article 20(3) are the following:- (,) Narayanla/ v. M~ck. AIR 1961 SC 29, 38·39. (il) Charo,w v. Stau of MaharashtTa, AIR 1988 SC 938, 947. Stale for protection The protection given to the 'accused' commences as soon as a fonnal accusation is made, whether before or during prosecution.

The protection given to the 'accused' commences as soon as a fonnal accusation is made,

Notes on Article 21 StOPI \ Article 21, if read literally. is a colourless article and would be sati~fied, the moment it is established by me State that there is a law which provides a procedure which has been followed by the impugned action.But me expression 'procedure established by law' in article 21 has been judicially construed as meaning a procedure which is reasonable, fair and just. Read with article 39A. it would further imply legal aid bring made available to the indigent accused. and a prisoner. The concept of 'fairness', so evolved, has been imported into article 22(3) also, so mat a prison regulation which arbitrarily deprives a detenu of opportunity to interview his relatives or friends or II lawyer is invalid.

Regu/lIIion by the SttJIe Article 25, clause 2(a) saves the power of the State to regulate or restrict secular activitics associated with religious practice. These restrictions or regulations should be primarily concerned with the secular aspects of religious practice rather than with the cssentials of religion 115 per judicial Article 26 The Constitution of India 49 pronouncement. This view, enunciated for the fiBI time in Ratilal v. SlaU of Bombay, (1954) SCR 1055. has been followed in all later cases though the test is not easy to apply.

Notes on Article 27 
Article 27 is one of lhe essential consequences of secularism. A 'lax' is a compulsory exaction 
of money for public purpose. If the State exacts money through a taX whoSe prococd are assigned 
for the benefit of a particular religion. obviously the State favours, patronises and supports that 
particular religion. Hence the prohibition against such taxes, The distinction between 'tax' and 'fcc' 
has been adhered 10 in the context of this article also so that fees for secular regulation can be charged 
for defraying expenses of administrative regulation. Scc the cases cited under articie 25 supra. 28. Freedom as to attendance at religious instrnction or religious worship in certain educational institUtiODS.-{ I) No religious instruction shall be provided in any. educational institution wholly maintained out of State funds. (2) Nothing in clause (1) shall apply to an educational institution which is administered by the State but has been established under any endowment or trust wruch requires that religious instruction shall be imparted in such institution. (3) No person attending any educational institution recognised by the State or recciv· ing aid out of State funds shall be required to take part in any religious instruction that may be imparted in such institution or to attend any religious worship that may be conducted in such institution or in any premises Bltached thereto unless such person or, ir such person is a minor, his guardian has given his consent thereto. Article 29 The COllSlilulion of India Cullural and Educalional Righls 29. Protection of interests of minor!ties.-(J }_Any section of the citizens residing in the territory of India or any part thereof having a distinct language. script or culture of its own shall have the right to conserve the same. (2) No citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the State or receiving aid out of State funds on grounds only of religion, race. caste, language or any of them. Noles 00 Article 29 The leading cases on article 29 are: (i) Kerala Education Bill In re. AIR 1958 SC 956. (ii) Ahmedabad St. Xaviers College Society v. Slnte ofGujarat, AIR 1974 SC 1389 . . (iii) State of Bombay v. Bombay Education Society, (1955) I SCR 568 : AIR 1954 SC 561. (iv) GujaraJ University v. Shri Krishtul, AIR 1963 SC 703. (v) D.A. V. Colkge Bhalindo v. Slate of Punjab, AIR 1971 SC 1731. Although, commonly article 29( I) is assumed to relate to minorities, its scope is not necessarily 50 confined, as it is available to "any section of citizens resident in the territory of India". This may well include the majority, as Ray, CJ. pointed out in the Ahmedabad SI. Xaviers Colkge Society v. State ofGujarat, AIR 1974 SC 1389. As regards article 29(2), it should be read subject to article 15(4), (as inserted in 1951), penniu- ing special provision for backward classes, thus overriding the earlier decision in State of Madras v. Champa~ Doraimjan, (1951) ~ 525. See B.S.H.K.P. v. Union of India, (1985) 2 sec 644. An important consequence of the 'right to conserve' one's script is that citizens have the right to agitale for the protection of their language. 'Political' religion for the conservation of the langu- age of a section of the citizens cannot, therefore, be regarded as a conupt practice within the mean- ing of section 123(3) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. s.tah, C.J. in.Jagdev Singh Sidhanti v. P011Dp Singh. AIR 1965 SC 183, 188. RII,wnal IanptrKlI Not holding an entrance examination (pre-medical test), in any particul~ language viz. Hindi or any regional language, does not violate article 29(2); HiM; HitmJcrhak Samjti y. Union of India, AIR 1990 SC 85, paragraph 6. . MinDritUs Although the word 'Minorities' occurs in the Rlarginal oote to article 29, it does not occur in the text. The original proposal or the Advisory Committee in the Constituent Assembly recommendocl the following : "(I)-Minoriliu in every wtit shall be protected in respect of lheir language, script and culture and no law; or regulations may beenacted that may opernte oppressively or prejudicially in this respccL" [B. Shiva Ran, "Select Documents" (1957) Vol. 2, page 281.) But after the clause was considem:i by the Drafting Committee on 1st November: 1947, it emerged with the substitute of 'section of citizens'. (B. Shiva Roo, Select Documents (1957). Vol. 3 pages, 52.5-26. Clauses 23, Draft Constitution]. It was explained that the intention had always been to use 'minority' in a wide sense, so as to inCiude (for example) Maharashtrians who settled in Bengal. (7 C.A.D. pages 922-23). 52 Th~ Constitution of India Article 30 30. Right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions.-{ I) All minorities, whether based on religion or language. shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. 1[(lA) In making any law providing for the compulsory acquisition of any property of an educational institution established and administered by a minority. referred to in clause (I), the State shall ensure that the amount fixed by or determined umfer such law for the acquisiti,on of such property is such as would nol restrict or abrogate the right guaranteed under thai clause.1 (2) The Slate shall not, in granting aid to educational institulions. discriminate against any educational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority, whether based on religion or language. Notes on Article 30 Scop~ Article 30 is confined to minorities-whether based on religion or Janguage-and unlike article 29(1), it cannut be availed of by any 'section of cnizens'. At the same time, article 30(1) is not confined to the conservation of language, script or cullurc-unlike article 29(1). It may be, that the right given by article 29(1) is fortified, as regards mioorities. by article 30(1). But the two rights are separate; R~v. FatMr Proost v. Stol~ of Bihar, AIR 1969 SC 465.

At the same time, article 30(1) is not 
confined to the conservation of language, script or cullurc-unlike article 29(1). It may be, that the 
right given by article 29(1) is fortified, as regards mioorities. by article 30(1). But the two rights

The right to establish etc. an educational institution urxler article 30 is not confined to the conservation of language, script or culture. This was pointed out by Mathew, J. in A~dabad St. X(flIius Collt!gt! Soc~ry v. Sto.tt! of Gujarat, AIR 1974 SC 1389. Article 30 confers t,,:o rights : (a) right to establish an instirution,and (b) right to admjnis~r iI. The fonner means the right to create the institution, while the latter (right to administer) means Ihat the management of [he affairs of the instution must be free of external control, 50 that the founders or their oominees can would the institution as they thing fil and in accordance wilh their ideas of how best the interest of the commun- . ity in general and the institution in particular will be served; Md.

The words 'of their own choice' are important; Shri Krishna v. Gujarm Unil't!rsity, AIR 1962 Guj 86 (FB). The word 'establish' has been construed by Wancboo, C.J. in S. AZUl BasJw v.

Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities has defined 'minority' (by an inclusive definition), as under; (I) The tecm 'minority' includes only those non· document groups in a population which possess and wish 10 preserve stable ethnic, religious oc linguistic traditions or characteristics marskedly different from those of the fest of the population; (ii) such minorities should properly include a number of person suffficicnt by themselves \0 preserve such traditions or characteristics; and (iii) such minorities must be loyal to the State of which they are nationals. . Article 27 of the International Convenant on Civil and Political Rights does not derine the expression but gives the following right to them: "In those States in which ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities exist, persons belonging to such minorities shall not be denied_the right. in community with the other members of the group, to enjoy their own euhure, to profess and pr:lt:tice I~ir own religion or to use their own language." Minorll~s ~~d on rdision or IDnguage Backward classes are not minorities within anicle 30. As K.M.

(I) laws providing for acquisition of estates, take over of corporation etc. have fbeen saved by 
article 31A against challenge on the ground of alleged infringement of article 14 or article 19. (2) By article 318. Acts and Regulations specified in the Ninth Schedule have been saved against challenge on the ground of inconsistency with, taking away or abridging any jiuulamental right. However, after the decision in KesMvantJllda's case: (24 April. 1973), inclusion in the Ninth Schedule of any law is open 10 challenge on the ground of damage to the basic structure of the Constitution; Ktshavmuvula BOOml; v.

Article 31e. inserted by the 25th Amendment, 1971. protected laws giving effect to the Directive Principles in article 39{b) and 39(c) from unconstitutionality on the ground of contravention of articles 14, 19 and 31. By the 42nd Amendment, 1976, thlr protection was extended to legislation for implemcntion of any directive principle. But the Supreme Court in 1980 (by majority) held this extension of the protection to be unconstitutional on the ground that such an omnibus withdrawal of legislation from judicial review would undermine the basic structure of the Constitution. In 1983, the Supreme Court has declared the relevant observation in its 1980 judgment to be obiter. See the following cases:- (i) Minuva Mills v. U~ion of India, AIR 1986 SC 2030. (ii) Min~rva Mills v. Union of Indio, AIR 1980 SC 1789, paragraphs 30, 64, 70 and 80. (iii) Sojuv Cou Manufacruring Co. v. Sharal Coking Coal, AIR 1983 SC 239, paragraphs 13,14.

In 1973. the Supreme Court struck down this portion as unconstitutional on the ground that it was beyond the competence of the Constitution (25th Amendment) Act (Which introduced article 31 C) to lake away the power of judicial review to question whether a particular law which professed to give effect to a Directive Principle was, in reality, a law having that object or whether that was only its colourable purpose; K~shavananda Sharal; v. SlOle of Kuala, AIR 1973 SC 1461. It follows that the court can still consider whether a particular law purporting to implement any directive principal can question in constitutionality if it finds that the nexus between that law and the Directiye Principle relied on is illusory or colourable or whether it has 'directed and reasonable' nexus with the directive principle in article 39(b) or article 39{c); Shim Singhji v.

(4) The ~ight guaranteed by this article shall not he suspended e:u'ept as otherwise provided for by this Constitution. Notes on Article 32 Varitl]' of rigllb eommg up 1M en/oreemenl Right given by la,w or recognised by law can be analysed into the following categorics:- (a) fulldamental rights given by the Constitution; (b) constitutional rights not having the status of fundamental rights: (c) statutory rights: (d) righls nOwing from subordinate legislation; (e) righls based on case law; if) customary rights: (g) conlraCtual rights. Seope 0/ Article 32 Only fundamental rights falling within category (a) above can be enforced undere article 32. Cases illustrating this proposition about the scope of article 32 are the following:- (i) Hajj Esmail v. CO~Unl Officer, AIR 1967 SC 1244. (il) KJlriakose v. Slate of Keralll, AIR 1977 SC 1509. Court cannot detenmnc an issue not involving fundamental right; Indian Express Newspapen v. Union of India. (1986) I sec 633, paragraphs 200 and 207. Supreme Court and HiZh Court: ConcurrentjJlrisdiction (a) On the lext of article 32 and 266, where a fundamental nght is involved. a party should be free to approach cither of the two courts. And this, in fact, has been the cartier judicial approach; M.K. Gapalan v. Slate of M.P., (1955) I SCR 168, 174. In fact, sollie decisioos have pointed out thal since the remedy under smcle 32(1) is itself a fundamental right, the Supreme Coon is under duty to grant relief for violation of a substantive fundamental right. (i) Kochunni v. Slo.te of Madras, AIR 1959 SC 725, 729. (it) Tola Iron &: Suel Co. v. Sarl:ar, AIR 1961 SC 65. (iii) Bishan Dos v. Slate of Punjab, AIR 1%1 SC 1570. (iv) KIuJrak. Singh v. Stale o/~f.P., AIR 1963 SC 1295. Even still stronger are decisions holding article 32to be a basic feature of the Constitution which car.not be taken llway by even amending the Constitution; Fertiliser Corpor01ion 0/ India v. Union 0/ India, AIR 1981 SC 344, paragraph II. (b) Notwithstanding the above position. the Supreme Coun has, in certain decisions pronounced in 1987, staled thai when: rdiefthrough High Coun is available under anicle 226, the party should first approach the High Coon. (i) P.N. K/lnWlr'l. MlIIIiripol C01pOralion o/Delhi, (1987) 4 sec 609, 610, 61 I. (il) KQIIJlbhoi BrohmbluJtl v. Stak o/Gwjara1, AIR 1987 SC 1159. It is submitted with great respect that this view goes against the intendment of the Constitution and is contrary to earlier case law. Article 32 The Constitution o/India 59 Economic policy Judicial review is not concerned with economic poli:cy. The court does not substitute its judgment for that of the legislature or ils agents. as to matters within. the province of either. The court does not supplement the "feel of the expert" by its own views. When the legislature acts within the sphere of its authority and delegates power to an agent, it may empower the agent to make findings of fact which are conclusive, provided such findings satisfy the test of reasonable· ness. In all such cases. judicial inquiry is confined to the question whether the findings of fact are reMOnably based on evidence, and whether such findings are consistent with the laws of the land; Sitaram Sugar Co. LId v. Union o/Indio, AIR 1990 SC 1277, 1299, paragraph 86 (Judgment of Dr. Justice Thommen at page 1297, parugraph 52 and footnote 8, contains an exhaustive survey of case law as to arbitrary action. It covers several English, American and Commonwealth cases). Priu futltion Price fixation is not within the province of the court. Judicial review is exhausted when there is found to be a rational basis for the conclusions reached by the concerned authority. See the undennentioned decisions: (i) Union o/India v. Cynamide LId., AIR 1987 SC 1802, 1807: (1987) 2 scc 720, 736. (ii) Gupta Sugar Works v. State o/U.P., AIR 1987 SC 2353: (1987) Supp SCC 476, 481. (iii) Sitaram Sugar Co. LId. v.

It also lake.~ not of the fact that the legislation in question related to "actionable wrong" under the 7th Schedule, Concurrent list, entry 8, It also contains a suggestion (in para 129) to lay down certain norms and standards in regard to the industries dealing with materials which are of dangerous potentialities. In the judgment of Mr. Justice Ranganathtm, there is a suggestion that either the Fatal Accidents Act should be amended or fresh legislation enacted to d~1 with victims of mass disaster: [mer wiD. the suggested legislation should deal with the rollowing malters:- • (i) Fixed minimum compensation on no fault basis, pending riling oojudication of the case. (ii) Creation of a speciaJ forum with specific power to grant interim relief in appropriate ,=. (iiI) Evaluation of a procedure to be followed by such (special) forum. which will be conducive to the determination of the claims and avoid high degree of formalism in proceedings.

Writs against courts mart~ Articles 136(2) and 227(4) exclude the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the supervisory jurisdiction of [he High Court in relation 10 court martial. BUI [hey do nOI exclude the operation of arlicles 32 and 226. Hence, unless the subslantive fundamental right itself has been excluded by a law mad under article 33. the right survives and consequentially the remedy of writ also survives. Hence the general principles for grant of relief in writ and grounds for interference, as generally applicable to quasi-judicial proceedings, apply in relation to courts martial also. Accordingly. case law furnishes illustrations of judicial review of proceedings of couns martial on the basis of- (i) bias; Ranji/ v.

Notes on Article 34 Article 34 is primarily concerned with granting indemnily by law in respect of acts dOlle during operalion of martial law.

Legislation to gin effect to the provisions of this Part.-Notwithstanding anything in this Conslilulion.- (a) Parliament shall have. and the Legislature of a Stale shall nol have. power to make laws- (i) with respect 10 any of the matters which under clause (3) of article 16, clause (3) of article 32. article 33 and article 34 may be provided for by law made by Parliament; and (ii) for prescribing punishment for those acts which are declared 10 be offences under Ihis Part.: and Parliament shall. as soon as may be after the commencement of this Constitution, make laws for prescribing punishment for the acts referred to in sub-clause (il); (b) any law in force immediately before the commencement of this Constitution in the IcrrilOty of India with respect to any of the matters referred to in sub-clause (i) of clause (a) or providing for punishment for any act referred 10 in sub-clause (ii) of that clause shall, subject to the tenns thereof and to any adaptations and modifications that may be made therein under article 372, continue in force until altered or repealed or amended by Parliament. Explanation.-In this article, the expression 'law in force' has the same meaning as in article 372. Notes on Article 3S The significance of article 35 is positive as well as negative. From the positive aspect. it gives power to Parliament to legislate ror the enumernted mailers-which legislation can conlain penal provisions. Negatively, it extends the competence of State legislatures to make a law on the enumerated matters. even though some of those matters may rail within the State List. PART IV DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICY 36. Definition..-In Ihis Part, unless the context otherwise requires. 'the Slate' has the same meaning as in Part Ill. 37. Application or the principles contained in this ParL-The provisions contained in Ihis Pari shall not be enforceable by any court, but the principles therein laid down are nevertheless fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duly of the State to apply these principles in making laws. Noles on Article 37 Scop~ and objn:l: The ftegatil't aspect The object of Directive principles is to embody the concept of a welfare Stale; Kt!SMVatUl"OO Blwrali v. StllU of Keraln, (1973) 4 sec 225, paragraphs 134, 139. 174. However, the Directive do nol confer any enforceable rights and their alleged breach does nOI invalidate a law, nor does it entitle a citizen to complain of its violation by the state so as to seck rnandalory relief against the Stale. Similarly, if a legislative power docs not ellist in a particular legislalure, then the legislalure cannot seek to rely on a Directive principle for claiming that power. Undermentioned decisions support the above pr;)positions: (i) Kerow Edumlion Bill, In u, AIR 1958 SC 956. (ii) Deep CJumd v. Slole of V.P., AIR 1959 SC 648. (iii) Sfllle of Madnu v. C/wmptlkam Dorairajan, (1951) SC 525. (iv) From NaurwtUlji v. Slau 0/ Bombay, AIR 1951 Born 216. (v) UPSE Board v. Hari, AIR 1979 SC 65, paragrapb 4A. Scope and effect: The poritlve asped At the same time, the Directive principles have, according to later decisions of the Supreme Court. a positive aspect. Thus, the Directives have been held to supplement fundamental rights in achieving a Welfare State. Parliament can amend fundamental rights for implementing the Directives.. so long as the amendment does not touch the basic features. Legislation enacted to implement the Directive principles should be upheld, as far as possible. In (act. when necessary. even constitutional provisions as to fundamental rights should be adjusted in their ambit so as to give effect to the Directive principles. Even legislative ehtries may (within the limits of the total federal scheme) be given a wide interpretation for effecting Directive principles. Constitutional prOvisions (apart from fundamental rights) may be construed in the light of Directive principles. Undcrmcntioncd decisions iIIusttate the above propositions: (I) CJumdra Blravan v.
