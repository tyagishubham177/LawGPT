The definition is important as the Fundamental rights are enforceable by writs against the 'State'. Hence, no writ can be issued against any person or authority which does not come within this definition. (ii) 'State' includes the Union and State Executives, and also the Parliament and the State Legislatures and hence under judicial review, executive acts and the 'Acts' made by Par- liament or State Legislatures can be declared ultra vires by the Supreme Court or the High Courts. (iii) Local and other authorities: (a) University is covered under 'other authorities'. The Supreme Court in Rajasthan Electricity Board V. Mohan Lai, overruled Shanta Bai's case and held that University was under 'Other Authorities'. (b) Municipalities, Corporations and other Local Self Government institutions are 'State'. In Sukhdev Singh V. Bhagatram the Supreme Court has given a wide interpreta- tion. 'Other authorities' includes LIC, Oil and Natural Gas Commission, Industrial Finance Corporation etc. If the autho- rity has Constitutional or Statutory powers it is a State whe- ther it is discharging Sovereign functions or not. If it is an agency or instrumentality of the State or is discharging the functions of the State then it is within the definition of 'State'. (iv) Not a State: (a) Private persons, Private Associations, Cooperative Societies, Societies covered under Societies Registration Act, Companies etc. are not 'State'. (b) Courts are not within the definition of State for purposes of Art. 12. 11.2 : Doctrine of Eclipse : Meaning : According to the concept of 'Judicial Review', a law which is against the Constitution is void and ultra vires the Constitution. msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page57 Our Constitution became operative from 26-1-1950. Hence, any law existing prior to the Constitution (Pre- Constitutional Law) and any law made subsequently (Post- Constitutional Law) would be void if the law is against the Constitution. Hence, a question arises. If a Pre-Constitutional Law is held void by the Court as against a provision in the Con- stitution, and subsequently, if that provision in the Consti- tution itself is amended by the Parliament, will the 'void law' become operative or not? The Supreme Court has held that in such cases, the 'void law' will become operative automatically after the amendment is made. The reason is the Constitution will have 'eclipsed' or darkened that 'law', but when the Constitution is amended, the eclipse is removed and hence proprio vigors, the law becomes operative. This is called the Doctrine of Eclipse. Case: Bhikaji Narayan V. State ofMadhya Pradesh (1955). The Motor Vehicles Act was amended by the State and provided for monopoly of Road Transport by the State. In view of Art.19 (l)(g), Right of Trade or Business, this law became operative from 26-1-1950 (the date of commenc- ement of the Constitution). Hence, it became eclipsed by the Constitution. However, on 18th June 1951, Art. 19 (l)(g) was itself amended providing for Nationalisation etc. With this amendment the eclipse was removed, and the monopoly law revived. Post Constitution Law : Deep Chand V. State of U.P. (1959). The U.P. Transport Act came into operation in 1950. It provided for Nationalisation. But, as there was no proper provision for compensation, this law was held bad. But the 4th Amendment made inadequacy of compensation not ques- tionable in any Court. Question was whether the bad mono- poly law became operative after the Amendment. The Supreme Court held that the doctrine of eclipse was not applicable. The reason, was the law was made in 1955. It became void ab initio. It was a still born law and hence dead. Hence no revival. A new law is to be enacted, if required by the State. Doctrine applied to Post-Constitutional Law : in D. Lodh V. District Judge the Supreme Court applied to Post- Constitutional Law. In this case, a suit for ejectment was decided in favour of the landlord, but due to U.P. Civil law, this was inexecutable. The law was amended in 1976 to remove such injustice. Held, the doctrine of eclipse applied and the decree was executable. msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page58 Chapter 12 EQUALITY 12.1: Right to Equality : (i) Art. 14 : Art. 14 of the Constitution States as follows : The State shall not deny to any person, 'equality before the law', or 'equal protection of the laws', within the territory of India. (ii) Equality before the Law : (a) This is a negative concept taken from the English Constitution. It implies the absence of any privilege in favour of any person. It means that among equals the law should be equal and should be equally administered and that 'like should be treated alike' (Jennings). It also means the right to sue and to be sued, to prosecute and to be prosecuted for the same kind of action should be the same for all without distinction of race, reli- gion,wealth, social status or political influence (Jennings). (b) Dicey's concept of Rule of law has equality as its central core. According to him it means the 'Supremacy of Law'. Equality requires that Justice must be available to all. Hence, Justice should not be denied to the accused who on grounds of poverty is not in a position to maintain an advocate to defend him .. Legal aid is provided in England under the Poor Prisoners Defence Act, and, Legal Aid and Advice Act. In the U.S, the Supreme Court held in Powell V. Alabama that under "due process of law", the State was under a duty to meet the expenses of defence. In this case, 6 negroes had been accused of ravishing a white girl to death.There was no defence.

Legal aid is provided in England under the Poor Prisoners 
Defence Act, and, Legal Aid and Advice Act. In the U.S, the 
Supreme Court held in Powell V. Alabama that under "due 
process of law", the State was under a duty to meet the 
expenses of defence. In this case, 6 negroes had been accused 
of ravishing a white girl to death.There was no defence. The Supreme Court declared that the state should pay for the defence. In India, in Tara Singh's Case, it was held that opportunity should be provided to such accused as per Art. 22. In Hasinara Khatoon V. State of Bihar, the Supreme Court has held that Justice required that accused should be defended or State should ensure such legal defence, at its own cost. If legal defence is not provided, the trial would be vitiated. High Court Rules have however provided for defence as a 'must* when the accused has no means. 'Legal Aid Clinics' are now protecting the interests of such persons in Lower Courts. msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page59 (c) Equal Subjection to Courts : According to Dicey, equa- lity before the law means that no man should be made to suffer in body or goods except for a distinct breach of law ; It also means that no man is above the law and that all are amenable to the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts. Dicey was against the Administrative tribunals as they differed fundamentally from the Ordinary courts. The tribu- nals do not follow the court procedures (Civil and Criminal) and also the law relating to Evidence.But, these tribunals had come to stay.Hence,the courts have imposed a duty on these tribunals that they should follow the principles of natural justice. (iii) Equal protection of the Laws :(a) This is a dynamic concept taken from the U.S.Constitution (14th Amendment). It implies equality of treatment in equal circumstances. The essence of it is that when persons are similarly placed they must be similarly treated. In the U.S. in Plussey V. Furguson, separate accommoda- tion provided to the Negroes and Whites in the Railways was upheld by the Supreme Court. This was the 'Separate but equal' concept. This was overruled in Brown V. Board of Education 1954. Separate schools had been provided for Negroes and Whites. A Negro's application was rejected by a White School. Held, this segregation was Ultra Vires,as violative of 'Equal protec- tion of the Laws'. 12.2 : Doctrine of Reasonable Classification : The leading case is KathiRaning V. St. ofSuarastra (1952). In this case, Das, J, stated the two tests for reasonable Classi- fication : (i) The classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes one group from the other, and (ii) The differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by legislation. Art. 14 forbids class legislation, but does not forbid reaso- nable classification. This means, the differentia must not be arbitrary. It must be based on some qualities or characteristics found in one group. These must be absent in the group left out. What is essential is that there must be a nexus between the differentia and the object of legislation. State of Bombay V.Balsara : The Bombay Prohibition Act, made it an offence to manufacture,sell or consume intoxi- cating liquor. Military canteens had been exempted. Balsara msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page60 challenged this. Held, Miliary officials form a separate class or group by themselves. Civilians are different. This had a reasonable relationship with the object of legislation. The Military officers had special duties and responsibilities and this justified a separate treatment to them. Chiranji Lai V. Union of India (1951) : The Sholapur Spinning Co. was taken over by the Central Govt. This was challenged as violative of Art. 14. Held, Companies under mal-administration formed a class ; and the object of legis- lation was to protect the shareholders.Held, legislation was valid. In the Bank Nationalisation case, the Supreme Court struck down the Banking Companies Act.There was hostile dis- crimination between 14 nationalised Banks and other Indian and Foreign Banks. Even new banks could be started and could do business.But, the 14 Banks had been taken over and hence prevented from doing business. Held, discriminatory. (The Act was suitably amended by Parliament later). Widened Meaning of Equality : In Maneka Gandhi's Case,the Govt. had impounded the passport, and this was held as "not justified". The Supreme Court held that equality was not limited to the "judicial formula" of reasonable classifi- cation. It was much -wider. The Legislative Act should not only pass the two tests of reasonable classification, but also be NOT ARBITRARY. Accordingly, impounding a passport without hearing was "not fair". (The petitioner was heard & passport issued.) In International Airport Authority Case, the court held that equality had an "activist magnitude" and embodied guarantee against arbitrariness. In Air India V. Meerza, the regulation that air-hostess should retire on attaining 35 years, or upon marriage, or upon first pregnancy, was held ultra vires, as this classification was arbitrary. In Mithu V. State of Punjab, Sn. 303. I.P.C.was struck down. In this case, if a person is guilty of murder under Sn. 3021.P.C., the court in its discretion may award death penalty, but under Sn.303 I.P.C. if the person, a prisoner (under life imprisonment), commits murder, then the court shall give death penalty. This classification was held bad as under Sn. 302, there was judicial discretion but there was no such discretion under Sn. 303. Hence Sn., 303 was arbitrary and bad. msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page61 Basis of Classification: Reasonable classification may be based on different grounds: (i) Geographical basis : Depending on the peculiar cir- cumstances and situations, the classification may be based on territorial grounds.

Basis of Classification: 
Reasonable classification may be based on different 
grounds: 
(i) Geographical basis : Depending on the peculiar cir-
cumstances and situations, the classification may be based on 
territorial grounds. Thus, in Ram Chandra V. State of Orissa, two Nationa- lisations Acts,to take over road transport for different areas in the State of Orissa were held valid, as there were material differences peculiar to the two Acts.But, districtwise distri- bution of seats in the Medical College was held bad in Rajendran V. Tamilnadu. Law providing for different fees in Medical and Engineering Colleges between residents and non-residents was held valid in Joshi V. State ofM.P. (ii) Historical basis: Merger, State reorganisation etc.may be grounds for reorganisation. In Pavitra Kumar V. State of W.B.,\he different categories of Advocates into Barrister- advocates and non-barrister advocates was held valid for "historical reasons". (Now Under Advocates Act 1962 there is no such classification). Special immunity to Ex-Rulers in C.P.C. was held valid on historical grounds. (iii) Time as the basis : The basis of classification maybe based on date of operation of law. For instance, an enhanced tax rate may be imposed from a particular date. Pending cases may be taxed at old rates. This is not hit by Art. 14. (iv) Nature of persons, trade, calling or business: Classi- fication of persons, on the basis of age,for instance is valid (Sn. 11 Contract Act). Small Scale Industries, may be classified as one group for favoured treatment; Classification of News papers into Small, Medium and Big for levying customs duty on newsprint was held valid (Ex- press Newspaper Case). (v) Special Courts and Special Procedure: Leading case: Kathi Ranning V. State ofSaurastra. In re Special Courts Bill the Supreme Court has held that Special Courts and Special Procedures were valid if the law clearly lays down the guiding principles e.g. public safety, main- tenance of public order etc. The offences must be properly classified in relation to the objective to be achieved. (vi) Tax basis :The basis of tax must pass the test of msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page62 classification under Art. 14. Hence, tax on Virginia tobacco but no tax on country tobacco was held valid in E-I-Tobacco Case. (vii) Individual or group may be classified, if it is not arbitrary and answers the two tests. Eg. Ameerunisa V. Mehboob: There were continuous court litigations between two claimants. The Hyderabad Legisla ture passed the Walud Dowla Succession Act and gave the property of the deceased Nawab of Hyderabad to one party. The other party challenged this law as it denied its right to claim the property, just as any other citizen, in a court. Held, classification was bad. The essence of Art. 14 is that not only that there must be a reasonable classification having a relation to the objective to be achieved, but that such a classification itself should not be arbitrary. 12.3 : Art. 14 and Special Courts : Whether Special Courts may be constituted by the Legis- lature to try certain types of offences, was discussed in detail by the Supreme Court in 'in re Special Courts 'case. The Court held that the Bill was valid. The classification of offences during Emergency had been defined. The duration had been specified. There were no unguided and uncontrolled powers to the Executive. The guide lines were clear. Art. 14 guarantees to all persons (1) Equality before the law and (2) Equal protection of the Laws, within the territory of India. Equality before the law means that among equals, law should be equal and should be equally administered, and that like should be treated alike. It includes the right to sue and to be sued, to prosecute and to be prosecuted without any distinction of religion race, Wealth, Social Status or Political Influence. This includes the concept of "Rule of Law". According to Dicey, this means the supremacy of law, and, that no man is above the Law; It means that no person shall suffer in body or goods except for a distinct breach of law, and, that all persons are amenable to the jurisdiction of the ordinary Courts. msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page63 What Dicey meant by this was that every official from the Prime Minister, down to a constable, is under the same responsibility, for every act done without legal justification, as an ordinary citizen is. Further, he is subject to the juris- diction of the same courts as are available to citizens. In State of West Bengal VAnwarAli, the Act had provided for special courts to conduct "speedier trial of certain offen- ces". The Govt.could select the offences for speedy trial. The Supreme Court held that this was an arbitrary Power and violated Art. 14. No guidelines were given by the Act to classify the offences. Further, the procedure for trial also varied from the general procedure provided in the Cr.P.C. This was also held bad. However, in Kathai Raning V.State of Saurastra, the law had given proper guidelines and also had specified the cate- gories of offence that could be selected for special trial. Hence, the law was held good. In its advisory opinion, in "In re special courts case ", the Supreme Court held that special courts set up to try offences committed during national emergency of 1975-77,did not violate Art. 14. and the procedure provided therein, was held not against the Constitution. Hence, in India ,Special Courts may be constituted by law, but the law should classify the offences or provide clear guidelines to the Govt. to classify. There should be no room for any arbitrary discretion of the executive. The procedure should not be substantially different from the one prescribed by ordinary law. msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page64 Chapter 13 FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND EXPRESSION Art. 19 (l)(a) of the Constitution guarantees to every Citizen freedom of speech and expression.

Chapter   13 
FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND EXPRESSION 
Art. 19 (l)(a) of the Constitution guarantees to every 
Citizen freedom of speech and expression. Nowhere in the world, freedom of speech is guaranteed in absolute terms. The U.S. Constitution in its 1st Amendment stated : 'Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or of the Press'. The Supreme Court stated in Schenck V.United States : 'Free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre, and causing a panic'. The Court formulated the 'clear and present danger test' as a restriction in Dennis Vs. United States. The Smith Act was challenged in this case.(Teaching etc. of overthrowing of Government by force was made an offence in this Act). This was held good. Similarly, Censorship restrictions have been upheld. (Don Juonfilm case). Instead of leaving to the Courts as in the U.S.to define the scope, our Constitution has provided that reasonable restric- tions could be imposed by the Parliament and State Legisla- tures on the following grounds: Art. 19 (2): (a) Sovereignty and Integrity of India. (b) Security of the State. (c) Friendly relations with Foreign States. (d) Public Order. (e) Decency or Morality. (f) Contempt of Court. (g) Defamation. (h) Incitement to an offence. Scope : The freedom of speech and 'expression': The freedom is comprehensive and includes not only words spoken, but also the freedom of the Press, which is the basic essential of political liberty for proper functioning of demo- cracy. The basic principle behind this freedom is the right of the people to know the truth. (i) Ramesh Thaper V. State of Madras 1950 : Madras Govt's, ban order of entry and circulation of 'Cross Roads' a Bombay Weekly, was held ultra vires. msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page65 (ii) Brij Bhushan V. Delhi: Precensorship of 'Organiser' was held Ultra Vires the Constitution. Held,the 'Security of the State, in Act 19(2) did not empower the State to impose restrictions to control 'Public Order'. This led to the First Amendment which introduced three grounds: 'public Order' 'Friendly relationship with Foreign Countries' and 'incite- ment to an offence.' (iii) In Shailabala Devi's Case, the Supreme Court allowed publication of 'Sangram' as it contained only meaningless words, though high sounding and bombastic. (iv) Bennett Colemen V. India: The G.O. prescribing the number of pages, at 10 to all newspapers under Newsprint Control Order was held ultra vires as it affected the circulation of newspapers. In Sakal Papers V. Union, the restriction on prices of newspapers with reference to pages and sizes,was held bad,by the Supreme Court as it affected publication of supplements etc. (v) Lady Chatterly's lover : This book was banned as obscene. A book seller challenged this, but the Supreme Court held that the ban was within permissible limits of Decency and Morality and hence valid.He was convicted (Ranjit V. State of Maharashtra). (vi) K.A. Abbas V. Union of India : Film censorship was upheld in this case as motion picture stirs up emotions than any other media. For the film'The Tale of four cities' 'U' Certificate was not granted. The Court upheld the action of the Govt. The classification of films into"A" (for adults only) and 'U' (for all) was held valid. (vii) In Namboodripad's Case, the Supreme Court upheld his conviction and held that his attack on the judiciary, calculated to lower the prestige of the judges amounted to contempt of Court. Conclusion: The Courts in India have upheld the freedom of speech and expression as a precious right and as the quint-essence of democracy. msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page66 Chapter 14 PERSONAL FREEDOMS 14.1: Rule against Retrospective Criminal Law : Art. 20 (1): (i) One of the cardinal principles of Criminal Law is that "no ex post facto " Criminal Law shall be made by the State. This means the law must be prospective only. If the law is to have effect from an anterior date, that would be against this concept. This reason is the act is innocent when it is done, but, a law made subsequently has made the innocent act punishable with retrospective effect. This rule available in England and U.S. is embodied in Art. 20 (1). (ii) The U.S. Constitution [Art. 1 Sn. 9 (3)] declares 'no ex post facto law shall be passed'. The leading case in Colder V. Bull. In this Case, the U.S. Supreme Court explained ex post facto law: (a) Making an act punishable which act was innocent at the time of commission, (b) Imposing a greater penalty in such cases, than what is already provided: or (c) Changing the procedure to the prejudice of the accused. (iii) Art. 20 (1): Provides that no person should be convicted of any offence, except for violation of law in force at the time of the commission of the offence. Further, it states that no person should be subject to a greater penalty than that which might be inflicted for the offence at the time of commission of the offence. But, in respect of procedure to be followed, the Supreme Court has held that there is no right to the accused to any particular procedure to be followed. The reason is all that procedural law are prospective. Shiv Bahadur V. St. of Vindhya Pradesh. The I.P.C. was extended to Vindhya Pradesh from Sept. 1949, but a Minister was charge-sheeted for a bribe taken in April 1949. It was contended that the extension of law was ex post facto law. Held, in fact, law was in operation in Vindhya Pradesh from 1921. The prosecution was held valid. Kedar Nath V. State of West Bengal.

was charge-sheeted for a bribe taken in April 1949. It was

In addition he was put a fine of Rs. 50,0007- under Criminal Law Amendment Act 1949. (A fine equal to the money received as a bride could be imposed under this.) Held, the Act of 1949 was ex post facto law and hence, could not be applied to K. In Berai V. Henry, the prevention of Food Adulteration Act had provided life imprisonment and the accused was under- going trial when the law was amended and punishment msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page67 reduced to 3 years. Accused could claim this, as it was beneficial to him. 14.2 : Right against Double jeopardy : One basic principle of Criminal Law is that no person who has been accused of an offence shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once. This principle is contained in Art. 20 (2) of our Constitution and also in S. 300Cr.P.C. The origin of this is in the English Law Nemo dabet Bis vaxari (no one shall be vexed twice). This has two rules namely: (i) Autrefois acquit (previous acquittal); (ii) Autrefois convict (previous conviction). According to this if a person has been prosecuted and either convicted or acquitted, the accused snould not &e tried ag; by any Court in India for the same offence. ^ In Venkata Raman V. Union of India, V was subjected to a departmental inquiry and was dismissed from Central Government Services on grounds of bribery. The police arrested him under 1611.P.C. for bribery. He contended that he should not be tried again. The Supreme Court held that the departmental proceeding was not a prosecution and therefore he could not get the benefit. In Maqbul Hussain V. State of Bombay—M was subject to an inquiry by the custom authorities who confiscated the goods from him and also fined him. Held Custom proceeding as not a prosecution. According to the Supreme Court, prosecution and punish- ment must be read in a conjective sense. That is, if a person is prosecuted and punished, he should not be tried again. Hence if a person is prosecuted and acquitted, the constitution is silent about this. But S. 300 Cr. P.C. provides that if a person is prosecuted and convicted or acquitted he should not be tried again for the same offence. Exceptions : Sn. 300 has provided for four exceptions. (a) Lack of Jurisdiction of the Court. (b) Distinct and separate offence than the one tried. (c) Consequences of an act resulting in a different offence altogether, e.g.: Ais punished for grievous hurt but the injured person dies as a result of the injuries, A may be tried for culpable homicide. (d) Does not apply to execution proceedings. In State of Bombay V. Apte : A was convicted for Criminal Breach of Trust under I.P.C. and under Insurance msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page68 Act. The Sessions convicted on the first, but acquitted as the necessary permission had not been taken under the Insurance Act, in the second. Thereupon, sanction was obtained and a fresh complaint was filed. Held, in the second prosecution the ingre- dients of the offence was different. Hence, in the second prosecution and ingredients of the offence were different. Hence, Art. 20 (2) did not apply. He could be tried. 14.3 : Right against Self-Incrimination : Art. 20 (3) : (i) One fundamental principle of Criminal Law is the right against Self-Incrimination. (ii) Origin: The Principle has its origin in England where it developed as a rule of evidence as a revolt against inqui- sitorial and unjust methods of interrogating the accused per- sons. This found its Constitutional Status in the 5th Amend- ment in the U. S. Constitution. The rationale for the right is that of protection to the innocent, and a safeguard against tyrannical prosecution. (iii) Art. 20 (3) : No person accused of an offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself. This is also called as rule against testimonial compulsion. According to the Evidence Act, the burden of proving the guilt of the accused is on the prosecution. The accused cannot be compelled to give evidence against himself. Certain conditions must be satisfied to get the benefit: (a) 'Accused of an offence' : The protection is given to only an accused. A person is accused when the First Infor mation Report (F.I.R.) is filed against him, or a Complaint is made to a Magistrate. Hence, statements made by a person before the custom officials, are, without accusation and hence not within Art. 20(3). (b) The protection is not available to a witness under this article. (c) Confessions made under Sn.164 Cr.P.C. before the Magistrate are valid, as there is 'no compulsion' (Kalavati V. Himachal Pradesh). (d) Testimony may be oral or documentary. Documents got under compulsion cannot be used against the accused. In msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page69 Sharma V. Sathish Chandra the Supreme Court held that documents seized under a search warrant, (without any com- pulsion) were not hit by Art. 20(3). The leading case is State of Bombay V. Kathi Kalu Oghad. The Supreme Court dis- posed of a batch of four appeals. In the Bombay appeal, specimen handwriting had been taken from the prisoner; in the Punjab appeal the confession of the prisoner led to the discovery of stolen property, guns and rifles. Impressions of palms and fingers were taken in the presence of the magistrate in another appeal.
----------------------------------------
The leading case is State 
of Bombay V. Kathi Kalu Oghad. The Supreme Court dis-
posed of a batch of four appeals. In the Bombay appeal, 
specimen handwriting had been taken from the prisoner; in 
the Punjab appeal the confession of the prisoner led to the 
discovery of stolen property, guns and rifles. Impressions of 
palms and fingers were taken in the presence of the magistrate 
in another appeal. In the West Bengal appeal, opium had been received by the prisoner through Railways and to compare his signature on the Railway Way Bill, the police had taken the specimen signature. Eleven Judges of the Supreme Court disposed of the case. It was held that material evidence i.e., the taking of specimen signatures, thumb impression, handwriting, foot or palm print, for the purpose of identification is not against Art. 20(3). Similarly demonstration or parade for identification is also not hit by Art. 20(3). But there should be no duress. For example, if 'A' the accused gives information to the police about weapons used in the commission of an offence, and if in pursuance of it the police discover the said weapons, then the fact of discovery is allowed. This is valid under Art. 20(3). (e) Compulsion is Prohibited : Compulsion means 'du- ress'. It includes physical or mental torture, or 'third degree' methods. Art. 20(3) safeguards against investigating officers who 'sit comfortably in the Shade, rubbing red pepper into a poor devil's (accused) eyes, rather than go about in the sun hunting up for evidence'. However, mere statement made in police custody does not infer duress, but, it must be proved as a fact in the msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page70 circumstances of each case. In Nandini Satpathy (Ex-Chief Minister of Orissa) case, the accused was called to Police Station to answer questions on charges of corruption. She refused to answer and claimed protection under Art. 20(3). Held, accused is entitled to keep her mouth shut, if the questions were of such a nature as to implicate her in this or in any other offence. Tape-recorded statements (taken without duress) were allowed in YusufAli case. In Kuttan Pillai 's case, a document recovered on search of house of accused was held not under duress. 14.4 : Right to life and Personal Liberty : Art. 21: (i) Art. 21 of our Constitution declares : "No person shall be deprived of his life or Personal Liberty except according to procedure established by law". The drafting committee, added the word "personal", to restrict the wide meaning of liberty. Though there was much discussion to adopt "due process of law" of U. S. Constitution (5th and 14th Amendments), it ultimately preferred the Japanese expression "procedure established by law". In England, the Magna Carta (1215) declared "No man shall be taken or imprisoned .... save by law of the land". (ii) Right to life : The Constitution guarantees the right to life but subject to procedure established by law. Life can be taken away by the State according to law. In Jagmohan Singh V. State of U. P. it was held that "death sentence" was not violative of Art. 21. Life does not mean the mere animal existence of man, but, "extends to protection of every limb of the body through which the soul communicates with the outer world". msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page71 (iii) Personal liberty : According to Blackstone, this means "the power of locomotion, or moving of one's person to whatsoever place one's own inclination may direct, without imprisonment or restraint unless by due process of law". Wider Meaning to include Arts. 21 and 19 : The Supreme Court had held in Gopalan's case, that Arts. 21 and 19 were mutually exclusive, and hence, preventive detention which was covered under Art. 21, could not be tested with the freedoms of Art. 19. This has been overruled in S. N. Sarkar V. State of West Bengal. Hence, the Preventive Detention Law, or any such law, may be tested under Art. 19. Hence the position is that while Art. 19(1) deals with a species of rights, or freedoms, Art. 21 takes in and comprises the residue. In Kharak Singh V State ofU.P. (1963), the petitioner was tried for dacoity but was released. The police opened a history sheet and put him under surveillance. They made domiciliary visits during nights, and the Supreme Court held that such visits were without the authority of law and hence,void. But in Govind V. State ofM.P. there was a Clear Law for domiciliary visits, and the Supreme Court upheld such visits. (iv) Procedure established by law: "Procedure" refers to the manner and form of enforcing law. The word "law" was understood to mean enacted law and hence, procedure established by law meant procedure prescribed by the Legislature. Such a law could not be tested as to its reasonableness (Gopalan 's case). This was changed by the Supreme Court in Hoskot V State of Maharashtra where it was held that 'law' must be 'reasonable'. Here a Reader of a college was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment; he served the sentence. He had not been given a copy of the judgment. Held, procedure established by law means 'fair and reasonable procedure'. A copy should have been given msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page72 to him. This was confirmed further in Menaka Gandhi V. Union of India. Thus in procedure established by law the 'law' should be valid as per Arts. 21 and 22 and must be reasonable. It must pass the tests of reasonableness under Art. 19. This wide interpretation has raised the standards of liberty to almost match with the American concept of 'due process of law'. Passport Cases : (a) In Satwant Singh V. A.P.O. (1967), the passport was not renewed to the petitioner to go abroad. The Supreme Court held that to go abroad was a fundamental right, and Satwant was entitled to his passport.

the passport was not renewed to the petitioner to go abroad. The Supreme Court held that to go abroad was a fundamental 
right, and Satwant was entitled to his passport. To meet this case the Passport Act 1967 was enacted by the Parliament. (b) In Maneka Gandhi V. Union of India (1978), the im- pounding of the passport was questioned. The Supreme Court, overruled Satwant Singh's case and held, that to go abroad was not a fundamental right. But, it held under (Art. 21) "procedure established by law," the law must be reason- able and must answer the tests of Art. 19. Hence, the denial of passport may affect the right to profession abroad etc. Passport was issued to the petitioner. (v) Art. 21 and National Emergency: When the National Emergency is proclaimed (Art. 352), the President may sus- pend Art. 14, 21 and 22. In the Habeas Corpus Case (Shukla V. A.D.M., Jabbalpur, 1976), the Supreme Court held that as the remedy had been suspended the Court could not go into the validity of the detention order. To meet this decision, the 44th Amendment has provided that Art. 21 cannot be suspended during national emergency. (vi) Extension of Art. 21 : Art. 21 has been extended to give protection to—(1) Under-trial prisoners; (2) Prisoners serving a sentence; (3) Prisoners subject to ill-treatment or inhuman treatment; (4) Persons against whom no trial is msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page73 launched for years (Pahadia V. State of Bihar)', (5) Person, who was kept in prison for years even after order of release by courts [Supreme Court has ordered for payment of com- pensation]; (6) Case of blinding of under-trials (Khatri V. State of Bihar); (7) Cases of abuse of young prisoners or under-trials etc.; (8) Free legal aid to indigent accused (Khatoon V. State of Bihar); (9) Cases of 'leg iron chains' to prisoner (Sunil Batra V. Delhi Administration); (10) Consul- tation with a lawyer in the prison, without the custom officer being present within the hearing distance (Francis V. Delhi); (11) Prisoners' right to publish books (State of Maharashtra V. Panduranga). (vii) Relationship between Arts. 21 and 22 : In Gopalan V. State of Madras, Gopalan who had been detained under the Preventive Detention Act, challenged the Act as violative of Art. 21. The contention of the State that Art. 21 did not apply as there was Art. 22 for arrest or detention, was rejected by the Supreme Court. It held that Art. 21 dealt with the substantive aspect, whereas Art. 22 dealt with the procedural aspect. In view ofManeka Gandhi's case, 'the law' must be 'reasonable' also (Art. 19). 14.4 A Right to Education Act 2009 Article 45 states “The State shall endeavour to provide, within a period of ten years, from the commencement of the Constitution, for free and compulsory education for all children until they complete the age of 14 years.” In 2002, the 86th Constitutional Amendment was passed by the Parliament adding Article 21A, to Article 21. Thus it became a fundamental Right like Right to life. msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page74 New Article: Article 21 A states: "the state shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of 6 to 14 years as the state may, by law determine".

[ Justice 
Radhakrishnan dissented   ]  
  The Supreme Court  has brought all educational 
institutions within RTE’s ambit except   unaided minority 
institutions 
It has held that the Act is operative from the academic year 
2012-2013 itself and  would not apply retrospectively to 
any admissions or to resident students in boarding schools. The private schools’ contention that such mandatory reservation would drain their resources was answered by the government, which promised reimbursement of money to the extent of the reservation. The Court held: . Article 21A requires non-state actors to achieve the socio-economic rights of children in the sense that they shall not destroy or impair those rights and also owe a duty of care. The State, however, cannot free itself from obligations under Article 21A by offloading or outsourcing its obligation to private State actors like unaided private educational institutions or to coerce them to act on the State's dictate. Private educational institutions have to empower the children, through developing their skills, learning and other capacities, human dignity, self-esteem and self-confidence and to respect their constitutional rights. Article 21 read with 21A, therefore, cast an obligation on the State and State alone. . I am, therefore, of the considered view that Article 21A, as such, does not cast msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page77 any obligation on the private unaided educational institutions to provide free and compulsory education to children of the age 6 to 14 years. Article 21A casts constitutional obligation on the State to provide free and compulsory education to children of the age 6 to 14 years. msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page78 14.5 : Right against Arrest and Detention: Art.22: (i) Protection : Art.22(l) to (3) deal with the protection given to an arrested person. (a) Any person, who is arrested, shall not be detained in custody without being informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds of arrest; (b) Every person who is arrested should be produced before the Magistrate within 24 hours of his arrest, excluding the journey time; (c) Every arrested person, shall not be denied the right to consult and to be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice. (ii) Preventive Detention Law : There are two types of detention—(1) Punitive and (2) Preventive. It is punitive if the detention is according to the sentence given by the Court, but in preventive detention, the person is detained not for any proved guilt, but to prevent him from the possibility of committing an offence. The objective is 'prevention is better than cure'. Safeguards: The preventive detention law must be according to Art. 22(4) to (7) and also Arts. 14,19, 21 and Seventh Schedule. The provisions may be summarised as follows (with 44th Amendment): (a) The preventive detention law may provide for detention up to 2 months; (b) The grounds of detention must be communicated to msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page79 the detinue, as soon as may be; (c) If the Advisory Board gives its opinion that there are no sufficient reasons, the detention made after 2 months is void (S. D. Prasad V. State of Bihar); (d) The Advisory Board shall consist of a chairman, a serving High Court Judge and two other members (may be retired judges), it should be constituted according to the direction of the concerned High Court Chief Justice; (e) Parliament is empowered to prescribe the maximum period of detention in any class or classes of cases; (f) The detaining authority, may not disclose the facts of detention, if it considers that it would be against the public interest to disclose. Recent legislation : The Preventive Detention Act 1950, which was being renewed from year to year, lapsed in 1969. But, in its place the MIS A (Maintenance of Internal Security Act 1971) was made. Sn.l7Aof this Act, was struck down by the Supreme Court, as it provided for 21 months detention without consulting the Board (Sarkar V. State of W.B.). In 1974, the Parliament enacted COFEPOSA (Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Act), 1974. The Parliament repealed the MIS A in 1978. In its place, it has passed the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA). msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page80 Chapter 15 SECULAR STATE Arts. 25 to 28 : (i) The Framers of our Constitution incorporated the Free- dom of religion which is the hall mark of Secularism in Arts.25 to 28. They were inspired by the U.S. Constitution, where according to Jefferson there is a wall of separation between the Church and the State. (First Amendment to U.S. Constitution). In our constitution, 42nd Amendment added "secular" to the preamble. Secular is opposed to "religious state (Theo- cratic State) " and "Irreligious state ". The State should be neutral, and, treat all religions equally. Religious practises, worshipping of God etc. are left to the dictates of every individuals conscience. The State should not interfere.lt should not aid one religion or prefer one religion over another. It should not collect any religious taxes.This is the essence of separation of the church from the State. (ii) Freedom of Conscience : Art. 25. All persons are equally entitled to the freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess, practise and propagate religion, (a) This is subject to public order, morality health and other provisions of part III. (b) State may by law regulate or restrict any economic, financial, political or other secular activity of the religion. (c) State may provide for (1) Social Welfare and reform or (2) Throwing open of Public Hindu religious institutions to all classes of Hindus. (Hindu includes a Sikh, Jain or msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page81 Buddhist. A Sikh may wear a Kirpan). In "Anand Marg" case, a ban imposed under Sn. 144 Cr.P.C. on Tandava dance with daggers, trisul, skulls etc.in public places was held valid on grounds of public order. (iii) Freedom of Religious Institutions : Art. 26 . Every religious denomination has the right: (a) To establish and maintain religious and charitable insti tutions.

Cr.P.C. on Tandava dance with daggers, trisul, skulls etc.in 
public places was held valid on grounds of public order. (iii) Freedom of Religious Institutions : Art. 26 . Every 
religious denomination has the right: 
(a) To establish and maintain religious and charitable insti 
tutions. (b) To manage its religious affairs. (c) To own and acquire property, and (d) To administer such property. (iv) These two Articles deal with the basic essentials of our Secularism. Art. 25 refers to persons whereas Art. 26 gua- rantees freedom to Religious Institutions. These are subject to certain restrictions. The limit and scope of these have ben discussed by the Supreme Court in a number of cases : Commissioner ofH.R. Endowments V. Laxmindra Thirtha Swamiar (Sirur Mutt Case) : The Madras Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment Act had provided for provisions to deprive the mahant of his right to administer the property.lt enabled the Commissioner to enter the premises and also the sanctum sanctorum of the temple.The Supreme Court struck down these provisions.lt declared that 'A religion is not only a code of ethical rules, but it contains rituals, ceremonies, modes of worship and also observances regarding dress, food etc. There is internal autonomy and no outside authority has jurisdiction to interfere.' In Venkataramana Devaru V.State of Mysore, the Madras Temple Entry Authorisation Act, provided for the entry of Harijans to any Hindu temple. This was challenged by the trustees of the temple belonging to Gowda Saraswaths. They claimed under Art. 26 (1), that they had the rights to manage the affairs of the temple and hence, they could bar the entry of any person. Held, Art. 25(2),to throw open Hindu temples msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page82 to all Hindus prevailed over Art. 26(1). The law was held valid. In Saifuddin V State ofBombay,ihe right of a religious head to excommunicate a member from the community was held valid. In Ratilal V. State of Bombay, the Charity Commissioner was authorised to deviate the funds of public trust for pur- poses other than what the donors had indicated. Held, this violated Art.26. State ofRajastan V. Sajjanlal. The temple of Lord Jagan- nath at Puri is a denominational temple. If a law provided for a non-member of the denomination to be a member or chair- man of the Managing Committee, then it would be violative of Arts. 25 and 26.As the Rajastan Public Trust Act did not have such an effect, it was held valid. In "National Anthem" case our Supreme Court held that "religious objectors" (Jehovas) could not be compelled to salute the national flag. Three children, who stood up respectfully, but refused to sing national anthem were expelled from school. The court followed the American Supreme Court (Barnette's Case), and held that standing respectfully but not singing national anthem, was not violative of any law. The expulsion order was quashed. In Archaka's Case, the Supreme Court held that the office of Archaka is secular, and, hence a Hindu, who is qualified in Agamas etc. as required by the Hindu Temple, should not be denied of his opportunity in appointment on grounds of caste. (v) Freedom from religious taxes : Art. 27 declares that no person should be compelled to msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page83 pay any taxes or tolls to promote or maintain any particular religion or its denomination. In Sri Jagannath V. State ofOrissa, the Supreme Court held valid a fee levied by the Orissa H.R.E. Act, as there was no favour to any particular religion or religious denomination. In Swamiar's Case, the Supreme Court held, a fee 5% of the total income of the religious institution per annum was a 'tax' and hence the Madras Legislature was incompetent. The levy was held ultra vires. (vi) Art. 28 states that religious instructions shall not be provided in Educational Institutions wholly maintained out of State Funds. (a) a State may administer an Educational institution creat ed under a trust or endowment which requires imparting of religious instruction. (b) (c) In State recognised or aided public educational institu tions if there is any religious instruction or worship, compul sory attendance of any person is barred. But, voluntary atten dance is not barred. Similarly a minor may attend if his guardian has given consent.
