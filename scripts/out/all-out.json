By itself, it is not enforceable in a Court of Law, yet it states objects and aids legal interpretation of the Constitution, where language is ambiguous...construction which fits the preamble may be preferred (However, the preamble cannot override the express provisions of an Act). Am endm ent of Pream ble In Berubarif ’ case (AIR 1960 SC 858), held that Preamble is not a part of Constitution. However'i'in Keshavanand’s case (AIR 1973 SC 1467) held that it is part of Constitution and Conititution should be read and interpreted in the light of grand and noble vision expressed in Preamble. In fact, the Preamble was relied on in imposing implied limitations on amendment under Art. 368. Held that since Preamble is part of Constitution, it can be amended, but ‘basic features' in it can’t be amended. Amending power can’t change the Constitution in such a way that it ceases to be a ‘Sovereign Democratic Republic'. 3. FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES AND FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES [A] Fundamental Rights Part HI of the Constitution, which contains fundamental rights, has been described as the Magna Carta of India. These fundamental rights substantially covers all the traditional civil and political rights enumerated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Dr. Ambedkar described them as “the most criticized part” of the Constitution. Gajendragadkar, J. described them as the “very foundation and cornerstone of the democratic way of life ushered in this country by the Constitution”. Fundamental rights, subject to the provisions of the Constitution, cannot be violated or interfered with by any law, order, or Act of the government. Fundamental rights were deemed essential to protect the rights and liberties of the people against the encroachment of the power delegated by them to their government. They are limitations upon all the powers of the government. In Maneka Gandhi case, Bhagwati, J. observed: “These fundamental rights represent the basic values cherished by the people of this country since the Vedic times and they are calculated to protect the dignity of the individual and create conditions in which every human being can develop his personality to the fullest extent. They weave a ‘pattern of guarantee’ on the basic structure of human rights, and impose negative obligations on the State not to encroach on individual liberty in its various dimensions.” These rights are regarded as fundamental because they are most essential for the attainment by the individual of his full intellectual, moral and spiritual status. The object behind the inclusion of them in the Constitution is to establish ‘a government of law and not of man’. The object is to establish rule of law. These are available against State and not against private individuals. In A.K. Gopalan v State o f Madras (AIR 1950 SC 27), Mukherjee, J., observed: \"There cannot be any such thing as absolute and uncontrolled liberty wholly freed from Constitution/Constitutional Law 19 restraint, for that would lead to anarchy and disorder. The possession and enjoyment of all rights are subject to such reasonable conditions as may be deemed by the governing authority essential to the safety, health, peace, general order and morals of the community. Whdt the Constitution therefore attempts to do by declaring the rights of the people is to strike a balance between individual liberty and social control.” The Constitution also provides for the ‘suspension’ of fundamental rights in certain circumstances. Art. 358 provides that when the President under Art. 352 makes the proclamation of emergency, the freedoms guaranteed by Art. 19 are automatically suspended for the period of emergency. Art. 359 further empowers the President to suspend the right to move any court for the enforcement of fundamental rights (except Arts. 20 and 21) during the continuance of emergency. ' It is now an established proposition that an individual cannot waive any of his Fundamental Rights. This proposition has been applied in a number of cases. “The State cannot arrogate to itself a right to commit breach of the Fundamental Rights of any person by resorting to principles of waiver or estoppel or other similar principles.” The fundamental rights can be classified under the following six groups: (a) Right to equality (Articles 14-18). (b) Right to freedom (Articles 19-22). (c) Right against exploitation (Articles 23-24). (d) Right to freedom of religion (Articles 25-28). (e) Cultural and educational rights (Articles 29-30). (f) Right to Constitutional remedies (Articles 32-35): The 44th Amendment has abolished the ‘right to property’ as a fundamental right guaranteed by Art. 19(1) (f) and Art. 31 of the Constitution, ft is now only a legal right. ARflCLE 12: Definition of State “Unless the context otherwise requires, the term 'State' include the following - executive and legislature o f Union and States; dll local or other authorities within territory o f India or under the control o f government.\" In the context of Art. 12, ‘authority’’ means the power to make laws, byelaws, etc., which have the force of law and power to enforce those laws. The expression ‘other authorities’ in Art. 12 is used after mentioning the executive and legislature of Union and States, and all local authorities (viz. Municipalities, Panchayats). The ejusdem generis rule, however, could not be resorted to in interpreting this expression, as there isr no common genus running through these named bodies (in Art. 12), nor can these bodies so placed in one single category on any rational basis. In Electricity Board, Rajasthan and Sukhdev Singh v Bhagatram cases, the Supreme Court field that only the authorities created by the Constitution or Statute are the ‘other authorities’, though it is not necessary that statutory authority* should be engaged ifi performing governmental functions. Thus, Rajasthan Electricity Board, Co-operative society, ONGC, LIC, etc. are held to be ‘other authorities’.",

    "content": "Rajasthan Electricity Board, Co-operative society,  ONGC, LIC, etc. are held to be ‘other authorities’. But in subsequent decisions, a broad and liberal interpretation to the expression ‘other authorities’ was given in view of the 20 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations fact that in a welfare State, a government has to employ various agencies or instrtimentalities (which are not created by statute). ■ , In R.D. Shelly v International Airport Authority o f India (AIR 1979 SC 1628), the Irifemational Airport Authority held to be ‘the State’. The court laid down the following tests: (i) State mainly or chiefly contributed to the financial resources. (ii) Deep and pervasive State control e.g. appointment and removal of members ' of a society, etc. (iii) Functions of corporation are of public importance i.e. governmental in , essence. (iv) If a government department is transferred to a corporation. (v) Corporation enjoys monopoly status which is State-conferred. Applying this test in Som Prakash v Union o f India, the court held that a government company (Bharat Petroleum Corporation) is ‘State’. The expression ‘other authorities’ is not confined only to statutory corporation alone, but may include a government company, a registered society, or bodies which have some nexus with the government. The emphasis is on ‘functionality plus State control’ rather than the statutory character of the corporation. In Ajay Hasia case, held that a registered society is an agency or instrumentality of the State. Thus, held that the Regional Engineering College established and administered by a registered society is a ‘State’. In Unni Krishnan v State o f A.P. (1993) 1 SCC 645, the court observed that the term ‘authority’ may cover any other person or body performing ‘public duty’. Thus, a private medical/engineering college comes within the writ jurisdiction of the court irrespective of the question of aid and affiliation. In Tekraj Vasandi case, held that the ‘Institute of Constitutional and Parliamentary Studies’ is not a ‘State’. Similarly, in Chandra Mohan Khanna case, held that N.C.E.R.T. is not a ‘State’ as the governmental control is confined only to proper utilization of the grant. In S.M. Ilyas v ICAR [1993 (1 SCC 182)], held that the Indian Council of Agricultural Research is a ‘State’. In recent cases, held that Hindustan Steel Works Construction Ltd. is not a State; Steel Authority o f India Ltd. is a State; BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) is not a State. In M.C. Mehta v Union o f India (1987) 1SCC 395, the question was whether a private corporation (Shriram Food and Fertilizers Ltd.) is a “State” under Art. 12. The court observed that a non-governmental company can be placed within the meaning of Art. 12, if for reasons of State control and regulations and kind of public function they are performing, they satisfy the tests of instrumentality or agency of government. In Indian Council for Enviro-Legal Action v UOI (1996) 3 SCC 463, held that if by the action of the private corporate bodies a person’s fundamental right is violated the Court would not accept the argument that it is not ‘State’ within the meaning of Art. 12. In Pradeep Kumar Biswas v Indian Institute o f Chemical Biology (2002) 5 SCC 1, the Supreme Court by a 5:2 majority held that CSIR (Council of Scientific and Industrial Research) is an instrumentality of the State within the meaning of Art. 12 of the Constitution of India. It overruled the decision in Sabhajit Tewari case (1975). The majority held that even though it was formed under the Registration of Societies Act, I860, but it is a ‘State’ because the government had overriding control over the organization. The object Constitution/Constitutional Law 21 incorporated in Memorandum of Association of CSIR “manifestly demonstrates that CSIR was set up in the national interest to further the economic welfare of the society by fostering planned development in the country. The Government of India has a dominant role in the governing body of the CSIR. The court observed: “The Constitution has to an extent defined the word “State” in Art. 12 itself as including “the Government under the control of the Government of India”. That an “inclusive” definition is generally not exhaustive is a statement of the obvious and as far as Art. 12 is concerned, has been so held by the Supreme Court. The words “State” and “authority” used in Art. 12 therefore remain among “the great generalities of the Constitution” the content of which has been and continues to be supplied by courts from time to time. Keeping pace with the broad approach to the concept of equality under Arts. 14 and 16, courts have whenever possible, sought to curb an arbitrary exercise of power against individuals by “centres of power”, and there was correspondingly an expansion in the judicial definition of “State” in Art. 12.” In Virendra Kumar Srivastava v U.P. Rajya Karmchari Kalyan Nigam (2005) 1 SCC 149, the Apex Court explained the majority and minority opinions laid down in Predeep Kumar Biswas case. It observed: The multiple test which is to be applied to ascertain the character of a body as falling within Art. 12 or outside as laid down by the majority view in the aforesaid case is to ascertain the nature of financial, functional and administrative control of the State over it and whether it is dominated by the State Government and the control can be said to be so deep and pervasive as described in the minority view so as to satisfy the court “of brooding presence of the Government” on the activities of the Corporation. In G Bassi Reddy v International Crops Research Institute (AIR 2003 SC 1764), the International Crops Research Institute was not held to be a ‘State’ within the meaning of Art. 12. The court opined that it is an international organization and has been set up as non-profit research and training centre to help developing countries to alleviate rural poverty and hunger.",

    "content": "G Bassi Reddy v International Crops Research Institute (AIR 2003 SC 1764),  the International Crops Research Institute was not held to be a ‘State’ within the meaning  of Art. 12. The court opined that it is an international organization and has been set up  as non-profit research and training centre to help developing countries to alleviate rural  poverty and hunger. It is not set up by the Government, and is not controlled by nor is accountable to the Government. In Rupa Ashok Hurra v Ashok Hurra (AIR 2002 SC 1771), the Apex Court has re­ affirmed and ruled that no judicial proceeding could be said to violate any of the fundamental rights. It was said to be settled position of law that the superior courts of justice did not fall within the ambit of ‘State’ or ‘other authorities’ under Art. 12. In Zee Telefilms Ltd. v Union o f India (2005) 4 SCC 649, the Apex Court applied the tests laid down in Pradeep Kumar Biswas (2002) 5 SCC 111, to determine whether a body is State: (i) Principles laid down in A jay Hasia (1981) 1 SCC 722 are not a rigid set of principles so that if a body falls within any of them it must ex hypothesis be considered to be a State within the meaning of Art. 12. (ii) The question in each case will have to be considered on the basis of facts available as to whether in the light of the cumulative facts as established, the body is financially, functionally, administratively dominated, by or under the control of the Government, (iii) Such control must be particular to the body in question and must be pervasive, (iv) Mere regulatory control whether under statute or otherwise would not serve to make a body a part of the State. In the present case, the BCC1 (Board of Control for Cricket in India) was not found by the court (majority opinion) to be ‘State’. 22 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations The court observed: In Art. 12 the term “other authorities” was introduced at the time of framing of the Constitution with a limited objective of granting judicial review of actions of such authorities which are created under statute and which discharge State functions. However, because of the need of the day the Supreme Court in Rajasthan SEB (1967) 3 SCR 377 and Sukhdev Singh (1975) 1 SCC 421, noticing the socio-economic policy of the country thought it fit to expand the definition of the term “other authorities” to include bodies other than statutory authorities. This development of law by judicial interpretation culminated in the judgment of the seven-judge Bench in Pradeep Kumar Biswas case. It is to be noted that in the meantime the socio-economic policy of the country has changed and the State is today distancing itself from commercial activities and concentrating on governance rather than on business. Hence, there seems to be no need to further expand the scope of “other authorities” in Art. 12 by judicial interpretation at least for the time being. Is Judiciary Included In the word ‘State’? The judiciary, though not expressly mentioned in Art. 12, it should be included so, since courts are set up by statute and exercise power conferred by law. In Naresh v State o f Maharashtra (AIR 1967 SC 1), it was held that even if a court is the State a writ under Art. 32 cannot be issued to a High Court of competent jurisdiction against its judicial orders, because such orders cannot be said to violate the fundamental rights. What the judicial decision purports to do is to decide the controversy between the parties and nothing more. In view of the judgment in A.R. Antulay v R.S. Nayak (AIR 1988 SC 1531), where it was held that the court could not pass an order or issue a direction which would be violative of fundamental rights, it can be said that the expression ‘State’ includes judiciary also. ARTICLE 13: Laws Inconsistent with Fundamental Rights Clause (/) - All pre-Constitution or existing laws i.e. laws which were in force immediately before the commencement of the Constitution shall be void to the extent to which they are inconsistent with fundamental rights from the date of the commencement of Constitution. Clause (2) - The State shalln’t make any law which takes away or abridges the fundamental rights, and any law in contravention of fundamental rights shall to the extent of contravention, be void. Clause (3) - It gives the term ‘law’ a very broad connotation which includes any ordinance, order, byelaw, rule, regulation, notification, custom or usage having the force of law. Art. 13, in fact, provides for the ‘judicial review’ of all legislations in India, past as well as future. Art. 13 is not applicable to law declared by the Supreme Court u/Arts. 141- 142 [Ashok Kumar Gupta v State ofU.P. (1997) 5 SCC 201], Application and Rules of Interpretation o f Art. 13 (1) No retrospective effect - Art. 13(1) is prospective in nature. All inconsistent existing laws become void only after the commencement of Constitution. They are not void ab initio. Such laws exist for all past acts, transactions, etc. and for enforcing all rights and liabilities accrued before the date of the Constitution. However, nobody can claim his rights and liabilities to be enforced under a Constitution/Constitutional Law 23 particular procedure (in respect of pending proceedings) which becomes inconsistent with fundamental rights. (2) Doctrine o f Severability or Separability - It means that if an offending provision can be separated from that which is constitutional then only that part which is offending is to be declared as void and not the entire statute. The primary test is whether what remains is so inextricably mixed with the part declared invalid that what remains cannot survive independently.",

    "content": "primary test is whether what remains is so inextricably mixed with the part  declared invalid that what remains cannot survive independently. In R.M.D.C. v Union o f India (AIR 1957 SC 628), the court observed that the intention of the legislature is a determining factor i.e. whether the legislature would have enacted the valid part if it had known that the rest of the statute was invalid. Severability is the question of substance and not of form. (3) Doctrine o f Eclipse - It is based on the principle that a law which violates fundamental rights is not nullity or void ab initio but becomes only unenforceable i.e. remains in a moribund condition. “It is over-shadowed or eclipsed by the fundamental rights, and remains dormant, but it is not dead.” Such laws exist for all past transactions, for rights and liabilities incurred before the __ Constitution came into force, and for the determination of rights of persons who haven’t been given fundamental rights by the Constitution e.g. non-citizens (Bhikaji v State o f MR AIR 1955 SC 781). Does the doctrine o f eclipse apply to a post-Constitution law - Art. 13(2) deals with post-Constitution or future laws [while clause (1) deals with pre-Constitution or existing laws]. It is to be noted that in both Cl. (I) and (2) of Art. 13, a declaration by the court of their invalidity will be necessary, to make the laws invalid. In Deep Chand v State ofU.P. (AIR 1959 SC 648) and Mahendra Lai Jain case (AIR 1963 SC 1019), held that the doctrine of eclipse applies only to pre-Constitution law, and not to post-Constitution law, because voidness of latter is from its very inception and such a law cannot exist for any purpose. But, in State o f Gujarat v Ambica Mills (AIR 1974 SC 1300), held that a post-Constitution law which is inconsistent with fundamental rights is not nullity or non-existent in all cases and for all purposes. It will be operative as regards to non-citizens, because fundamental rights are not available to them. In Dulare Lodh v Additional District Judge, Kanpur case (AIR 1984 SC 1260), the Court applied the doctrine of eclipse to post-Constitution law even against citizens. A ‘void’ statute can be revived by constitutional amendment. ARTICLE 14: Equality before Law Article 14 embodies the idea of equality expressed in the Preamble. The succeeding Articles 15, 16 and 17 lay down specific applications of the general rules laid down in Art. 14. Art. 14 reads: \"The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection o f the laws within the territory o f India.\" While “equality before law ” is a somewhat negative concept implying the absence of any special privilege in favour of individuals and the equal subject of all classes to the ordinary law. “Equal protection o f law\" is a more positive concept implying equality of treatment in equal circumstances. The rule is that like should be treated alike and not that 24 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations unlike should be treated alike. In State o f W.B. v Anwar Ali Sarkar, the Court rightly observed that the second expression is the corollary of the first and it is difficult to imaging a situation in which violation of equal protection of laws will not be the violation of the equality before law. Thus, in substance the two expressions mean one and the same thing The words “arty person\" in Art. 14 denote that equal protection of law is available to any person which includes any company or association, etc. Art. 14 extends to both citizens and non-citizens and to natural persons as well as legal persons. The equality before law is guaranteed to all without regard to race, colour or nationality. Art. 14 app||es to both, the substantive as well as procedural law, as discrimination can occur in both. Exceptions to rule o f equality - Art. 361 provides that President and Governors shall not be answerable to any court for the exercise and performance of the powers and duties of office. Foreign Diplomats are immune from the jurisdiction of courts. Article 14 permits classification but prohibits class legislation - Art. 14 does not mean that the same laws should apply t< all persons or that every law must have universal application, for, all persons are not, by nature, attainmert or circumstances, in the same positions. Class legislation is that which makes an improper discrimination by conferring particular privileges upon a class of persons arbitrarily selected. While, Art. 14 forbids class legislation, it permits reasonable classifications of persons, objects and transactions by the legislature for the purpose of achieving specific ends. The classification must fulfill following two conditions: (a) it must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the group; and (b) the differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act. To illustrate by an example: Under Sec. 11 of Indian Contraci Act, persons who haven’t attained majority can’t enter into a contract. The two categories are adults and minors. The basis of classification is the age, which obviously has a relatisn to the capacity to enter into contract. The section, therefore, satisfies both requirements of a valid classification. Where a Special Act provides a summary/ speedier procedure (but harsher and more onerous than the ordinary civil procedure) for eviction of a person from unauthorized occupation of government premises, in N.L Caterer's case (AIR 1967 SC 1581), held that the Act is discriminatory. But, in M. Chagganlal v Greater Bombay Municipality (AIR 1974 SC 2009), it held that “government premises\" is a sufficient guidance for authorities to take action under special procedure.",

    "content": "in M. Chagganlal v Greater Bombay Municipality (AIR  1974 SC 2009), it held that “government premises\" is a sufficient guidance for authorities  to take action under special procedure. It laid down: (i) Where a statute providing for a more drastic procedure different from the ordinary procedure covers the whole field covered by the ordinary procedure, without any guidelines as to the class of cases in which either procedure is to be resorted to, the statute will be hit by Art. 14 (Anwar Ali case). (ii) However, if from the preamble and surrounding circumstances, as well as the provisions of statute themselves explained and amplified by affidavits, necessary guidelines could be inferre , the statute will not be hit by Art. 14 (Kathi Ranning v State ofSaurashtra AIR 1952 SC 123). Constitution/Constitutional Law 25 Various decisions have established important guidelines or principles which further clarify the “scope of permissible classification”: (1) A law may be constitutional even though it relates to a single individual if on account of some special circumstances that single individual may be treated as a class by itself. (2) There is always a presumption in favour o f the constitutionality of a statute. However, the presumption may be rebutted in certain cases by showing that there is no classification at all. (3) The classification made by a legislature need not be scientifically perfect or logically complete. Mathematical nicety and perfect equality are not required. Equal treatment does not mean identical treatment. (4) The question whether a classification is reasonable, and proper or not, must, however, be judged more on common sense than on legal subtleties. (5) The basis of classification may be different e.g. geographical, vocational, difference in time, difference in nature of persons, trade or occupation, etc. New Concept of Equality While the traditional concept of equality is based on the doctrine o f classification, the new concept is based on the doctrine o f arbitrariness. Art. 14 has rightly activist magnitude and it embodies a guarantee against arbitrariness. Arbitrariness is the very antithesis o f equality. In E.P. Royappa v State ofT.N. (AIR 1974 SC 555), held that equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be imprisoned within traditional and doctrinaire limits. In Maneka Gandhi case, the court observed that principle of reasonableness, which legally as well as philosophically, is an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness, pervades Art. 14 like a brooding omnipresence. In A.L. Kalra v Project & Equipment Corpn. (1984) SCC 999, the court said that for the application of Art. 14 one need not allege any discrimination vis-4-vis others. Arbitrary or unreasonable actions, according to court, are per se discriminatory. In Ajay Hasia case, held that allocation of one-third of total marks for interview was plainly arbitrary and violative of Art. 14. In Air India v Nargesh Meerza (AIR 1981 SC 1829), held that the termination of service on pregnancy was manifestly unreasonable and arbitrary and was, therefore, clearly violative of Art. 14. In Mithu v State o f Punjab (AIR 1983 SC 473), the court struck down Sec. 303,1.P.C. as unconstitutional. Sec. 303 prescribes that if a person under a life-sentence commits murder, he must be given death sentence. But under Sec. 302, if a person commits murder he may be awarded either death sentence or life-sentence. In BALCO Employees Union v UOI (AIR 2002 SC 350), the apex court held that there can be no judicial review of economic policy of the Government unless there is violation of the Constitution or any Act. The process of disinvestments is a policy decision involving complex economic factors. The petitioners have failed to prove that decision to disinvest in BALCO is any way capricious, arbitrary, illegal or uninformed. In Sarbanand Sonowal v UOI (AIR 2005 SC 3920), the validity of Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act, 1983 was in question. Held that the IMDT Act, which applied only to the State of Assam and not the other States similarly situated is discriminatory 26 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations as the classification based on ‘geographical basis’ contains provisions and prescribes such procedure that it virtually becomes impossible to detect and deport foreigners (illegal Bangladesh immigrants). Instead of achieving the object of detecting and deporting foreigners it defeats the purpose. For satisfying the test of Art. 14, the ‘geographical factor’ alone in making classification is not enough but there must be a nexus with the object sought to be achieved. In this case, it was also held that the fundamental right of a foreigner is confined to Art. 21 for life and liberty and does not include the right to reside and stay in this country, as mentioned in Art. 19(1 )(e), which is available only to a citizen of the country. The State reserves the right to expel them from its territory and to refuse to grant them certain rights which are enjoyed by its own nationals. In AIIMSStudents’ Union v AIIMS (AIR 2001 SC 3262), the Supreme Court while emphasizing “merit-based” selection, struck down the institutional reservation (i.e. for students of AIIMS) of 33% coupled with 50% reservation discipline-wise in the Institute’s post-graduate courses, as violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution.* p ie court observed: Any reservation, apart from being sustainable on the constitutional anvil, must also be reasonable to be permissible. Reservation other than constitutional reservation is subversion of fraternity, unity, integrity and dignity of individual. Institutional reservation is not supported by the Constitution. In Javed v State o f Haryana [JT 2003 (6) SC 283], the apex court upheld the constitutional validity of certain provisions of Haryana Panchayati Raj Act, 1994, which disqualified a person for holding office of Sarpanch or a Panch of a Gram Panchayat, etc. if he had more than two living children. The provision was held to be not discriminatory and the classification made by it (viz.",

The provision was held to be not discriminatory  and the classification made by it (viz. persons having more than two children and persons having not more than two children) is based on intelligible differentia having nexus with the object of popularization of family planning programme. The provision also does not violate Art. 25 of the Constitution. In Danial Latift v Union o f India (2001) 7 SCC 740, the petitioners challenged the constitutional validity of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986, under which Sec. 125, Cr. P. C., providing for maintenance of wives (including divorced women) by their former husbands, was made inapplicable to divorced Muslim women. The Act was said to be violative of Arts. 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India. Upholding the Act, the apex court said that a careful reading of the provisions of the Act would indicate that a Muslim husband is liable to make reasonable and fair provision for the future of the divorced wife which obviously includes her maintenance as well. Even under the Act, the provisions of Sec. 125, Cr. P. C. would still be attracted. In John Vallamatton v UOI (AIR 2003 SC 2902), the Supreme Court held that Sec. 118 of the Indian Succession Act, 1926 is discriminatory and thus violative of Art. 14. The impugned provision places certain restrictions upon an Indian Christian to bequeath his property for religious or charitable purpose. In State o f Haryana v Jai Singh (AIR 2003 SC 1696), the Government of Haryana issued a Notification granting remission of prison sentence to all convicts except those excluded in the said Notification. The Supreme Court held that the offences excluded had been properly classified (based on the nature of offence), and, there is no violation of Art. 14. Likewise, in S. Satyanaryan v Government o f A.P. (AIR 2003 SC 3074), the court Constitution/Constitutional Law 27 upheld the classification to keep away convicts for crimes against women from the benefits of remission, as reasonable, proper and not violative of Art. 14. [Note: New development in equality also includes increased emphasis on positive equality or affirmative action by the State (Mandat case, St. Stephen College case)]. ARTICLE 15: Non-Discrimination on Grounds of Religion, Race, Caste, Sex or Place of Birth Article 15 provides for a particular application of the general principle embodied in Art. 14. Hence, if a discriminatoiy action does not fall within the purview of Art 15, it may yet be avoided if it is obnoxious to Art. 14. When a law comes within the prohibition of A rt 15 it cannot be validated by recourse to Art. 14 by applying the principle of reasonable classification. It may be noted that, unlike Art. 14, the guarantee under Art. 15 is available to citizens only. Clause (1) - “The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only o f religion, caste, sex, place o f birth or any o f them.'\" The word ‘discrimination’ means ‘to make an adverse distinction with regard to’, ‘to distinguish unfavourably from others’. It must be noted that a discrimination based on any of these grounds and also on other grounds is not hit by Art. 15(1). Thus, a law which discriminates on the ground of residence does not violate Art. 15(1) (Place of birth is different from residence). Similarly, the requirement of a test in regional language for State employment doesn’t contravene Art. 15 as the test is made compulsory for all persons seeking employment. Clause (2) - “No citizen shall, on ground only o f religion, race, caste, sex, place o f birth or any o f them, be subject to any disability, liability, restriction or condition with regard to - (a) access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and places o f public entertainment; or (b) the use o f wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads and places o f public resort maintained wholly or partly out o f State funds or dedicated to the use o f general public.” (‘Places of public resort’ includes public parks, buses, railway, hospitals, etc.). It is to be noted that while clause (1) prohibits discrimination by State, clause (2) includes private persons also from making any discrimination. Provisos (or Exceptions) to Art. 15(1) and (2) Clause (3) - “Nothing in this article shall prevent State from making any special provision for women and children”. Thus, reservation of seats for women in a college does not offend against Art. 15(1). Clause (4) - “Nothing in this article or clause (2) o f Art. 29 shall prevent the State from making any special provision for advancement o f any socially and educationally backward classes o f citizen or for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.\" The scope of Art. 15(4) was discussed in Balaji v State o f Mysore (AIR 1963 SC 649). The court observed that Art. 15(4) only enables the State to make special and not exclusive provisions for backward classes. Clause (4) is only an enabling provision and does not impose any obligation on the State to take any special action under it. It merely confers a discretion to act, if necessary. 28 Law Guide (or Competitive Examinations In State o f U.P. wPradeep Tandort (AIR 1975 SC 563), held that while reservation for candidates coming from rural areas was Unconstitutional, for those coming from the Hill and Uttarakhand areas was valid as these areas were instances of socially and educationally backward-class citizens.

    "content": "Law Guide (or Competitive Examinations In State o f U.P. wPradeep Tandort (AIR 1975 SC 563), held that while reservation  for candidates coming from rural areas was Unconstitutional, for those coming from the  Hill and Uttarakhand areas was valid as these areas were instances of socially and  educationally backward-class citizens. In Dr. Priti Srivasta\\’a v State o f M.P. (AIR 1999 SC 2894) held that lowering of the minimum qualifying marks for admission to “super­ specialty” post-graduate medical courses in favour of the reserved category candidates is unconstitutional and violative of Art. 15(4) of the Constitution. The Apex Court in State o f M.P. v GD. Ttrlhani (AIR 2003 SC 2952), emphasized on the need for a common entrance test and minimum qualifying marks for admission to post­ graduate course. Again, in Harish Verma v A jay Srivastava (AIR 2003 SC 3371), the court reiterated with approval the law laid down in Preeti Srivastava and GD. Tirthani and struck down admissions given to in-service candidates, to post-graduate medical course, who had secured marks less than the minimum prescribed by the Medical Council of India. In K.H. Siraj v High Court o f Kerala (AIR 2006 SC 2339), the appellants challenged the validity of Kerala Judicial Service Rules 14 and 15, fixing the minimum marks for interview for selection of Munsif Magistrate. The Supreme Court held that the Rules made by the Kerala High Court for the selection of judicial officers is valid. It also held that interview is the best method of assessing the suitability of a candidate. It brings out overall intellectual and personal qualities of candidates while written examination will testify the candidate’s academic knowledge. Clause (5) - The Constitution 93rd Amendment Act, 2005, has added a new Clause (5) to Art. 15. Cl. (5) provides that nothing in Art. 15 or in Art. I9(l)(g) prevent the State in making any special provision, by law, for the advancement o f socially and educationally backward classes o f citizens or for SCs/ STs in so far as such special provision relate to admission to educational institutions, including private ones, whether aided or unaided by the State, other than minority educational institutions referred to in Art. 30 (I). ARTICLE 16: Equality of Opportunity in Public Employment Under Art. 16, the guarantee against discrimination is limited to ‘employment and appointment’ under the State. Art. 15 is more general and deals with all cases of discrimination which do not fall under Art. 16. Clause (I) - There shall be equality o f opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to '’employment or appointment ’ to any office under the State. Clause (2) - No citizen shall, on grounds only o f religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place o f birth, residence or any o f them, be ineligible for, or discriminated against in respect o f any employment or office under the State. In State o f Kerala v N.M. Thomas (AIR 1976 SC 490), the Court observed: “The rule of equality within Art. 16(1) will not be violated by a measure which ensures equality of representation in the services for the unrepresented classes after satisfying the basic needs of efficiency of administration.” The members of the SC, STs and other backward classes can be given concessions, test exemptions and other employment preferences (not involving reservations), under Art. 16(1). In this case, a new interpretation of Art. 16(1) were made. The majority stated that Articles 14, 15 and 16 form part of a string of constitutionally guaranteed rights Constitution/Constitutional Law 29 supplementing each other. Art. 16 was explained as an incidence of guarantee of equality contained in Art. 14 and, therefore, permitted reasonable classification of employees in matters relating to employment or appointment. Exceptions to Clauses (1) and (2) Clause (3) - It empowers Parliament to make a law prescribing any requirement as to residence within that State or UT, prior to employment or appointment in that State or UT. Clause (4) - It empowers the State to make special provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward classes of citizens, which in the opinion of the State are not adequately represented in the services under the State. Clause (5) - Nothing in this Article shall affect the operation of any law, which provides that the incumbent of an office in connection with the affairs of any religions institution or any member of the governing body shall thereof shall be a person professing a particular religion. Article 16(4) applies only if two conditions are satisfied - (i) the class of citizens is backward i.e. socially and educationally, (ii) the said class is’not adequately represented in service of the State. The second test cannot be the sole criterion. Art. 16(4) must be interpreted in the light of Art. 335 which says that claims of SC and ST shall be taken into consideration constituently with the maintenance of efficiency of administration. However, the 82nd Amendment Act, 2000 restored the relaxation in qualifying marks and standards of evaluation in both, job reservation and promotions to SC/STs by adding a proviso to this effect in Art. 335. In State o f Kerala v N.M. Thomas case, held that Art. 16(4) indicated one of the methods of achieving equality embodied in Art. 16(1), and Art. 16(4) do not exhausts the equality of opportunity which can be made available to the backward classes. The guarantee of equality before law is something more than is required by formal equality, and Art. 16(1) means effective material or real equality. Thus, Art. 16(4) is not to be read by way of any exception to Art. 16(1). “Equality of opportunity admits discrimination with reason, which means rational classification for differential treatment having nexus to the constitutionally permissible object.” Protective discrimination is a facet of equality under Arts. 14, 15 and 16 (Jagdish Lai v State o f Haryana AIR 1997 SC 2366).

Mandal Case The scope and extent of Art. 16(4) has been examined thoroughly by the Supreme Court in Indira Sawhney v Union o f India (“The Mandal Case”) (AIR 1993 SC 477). The Court by 6-3 majority upheld the decision of Union government to reserve 27% Government jobs for OBCs (Other Backward Classes) provided “creamy layer” among them are eliminated and reservation only confined to initial appointments and not promotions and the total reservation shall not exceed 50% (There is already a 2214% reservation for SC and STs in government jobs). However, the court struck down the government notification reserving 10% government jobs for economically backward classes among higher castes. The majority held that the Mandal Report is valid... however, no opinion is expressed by it. Also, held that a provision under Art. 16(4) can be made by ‘executive’ order. The majority opinion may be summarized as follows: (I) Backward class o f citizens in Art. 16(4) can be identified on the basis o f caste and not only on economic basis - A caste can be quite often is a social class in India and if 30 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations it is backward socially, it would be a backward class for the purpose of Art. 16(4). Though caste alone can’t be taken into consideration for purposes of identification of backward classes (occupation groups, classes and sections of people are other important criteria). (II) Art. 16(4) is not an exception to Art. 16(1), but an independent clause. Reservation can be made under Art. 16(1) on the basis o f reasonable classification - The court thus overruled Balaji case and approved Thomas case. Further, court said that Art. 16(4) is exhaustive of the subject of reservation in favour of backward classes, though it may not be exhaustive of very concept of reservation. Reservation for other classes can be made under Art. 16(1). (III) Backward classes in Art. 16(4) are not similar to as socially and educationally backward in Art. 15(4) - It is much wider and takes in SC/STs and OBCs including socially and educationally backward classes. (IV) Creamy layer (socially advanced persons) can be and must be excluded from Backward Classes - For excluding creamy layer, an economic criteria can be adopted as an indicium or measure of social advancement. (V) Art. 16(4) permits classification o f backward classes into backward and more backward classes. (VI) A backward class o f citizens cannot be identified only and exclusively with reference to economic criteria - Mainly social, and therefore educational and economic backwardness has to be taken into account. ~~ (VII) Reservation shall not exceed 50 percent - Art. 16(4) speaks of adequate representation and not the proportionate representation. Rule of 50% applicable to reservation proper only, not to exemptions, concessions or relaxations provided to backward classes. The court also held that ‘carry forward rule' (to carry forward the unfilled vacancies in the next year) is valid provided it shouldn’t result in breach of 50% rule. (VIII) No reservations in promotions - The court thus overruled A.B.S.K. Sangh Rly. case (AIR 1981 SC 298). The Supreme Court observed that the rule of reservation cannot be called anti-meritarian. It also observed that there are certain services where reservation should not be applied e.g. Professors, Pilots, Scientists, Technicians, Technical posts, Defence Services, etc. Comments: The determination of backwardness on the sole ground of caste has been criticised by Nani A. Palkhiwala, an eminent jurist, on the ground that it will revive casteism which the Constitution emphatically intended to end. The minority judgment of justices Thomas, Kuldip Singh and R.M. Sahai according to Palkhiwala state the correct law. They had held that casteism can never be the basis of reservations for employment under the Government. Other Cases Application of reservation to ‘Single isolated post’ will amount to 100 per cent reservation, which is not permissible [Post Graduate Institute o f Med. Ed. & Res. v Faculty Association, JT 1998(3) SC 223]. In E.V. Chinnaiah v State o f A. P. (2005) 1 SCC 394, it was held that it is not open to a State to sub-classify the Scheduled Castes and apportion the seats/quota already reserved for Scheduled Castes as a whole, amongst sub-classes of Scheduled Castes so Constitution/Constitutional Law 31 created. Such sub-classification or micro-classification would be violative of Art. 14 and of the doctrine of reasonableness. Except, to the extent the Constitution itself makes a sub-classification, there cannot be grouping of Scheduled Cates into different categories for differential treatment. The Constitution itself has kept the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes List out of interference by the State Governments. The court also noted: Reservation to a ‘backward class’ is not a constitutional mandate. It is the prerogative of the State concerned. Though the State can lay down a legislative policy as regards extent of reservation to be made for different members of the backward classes including Scheduled Castes, it cannot take away the said benefit on the premise that one or the other group amongst the members of the Scheduled Castes has advanced and thus, is not entitled to the entire benefit of reservation. In A.P.B.C. Sangh v Jharkhand State Vaishya Federation (AIR 2006 SC 2814), the appellants challenged the validity of the State Government order amalgamating ‘Extremely Backward Class’ and ‘Backward Class’ into one group for the purpose of reservation in professional and educational institutions as violative of Art. 14. It was held that the State Government’s decision to amalgamate the two classes is unreasonable as two different classes are treated similarly. Treating unequals as equals is violative of Art. 14.",

Sangh v Jharkhand State Vaishya Federation (AIR 2006 SC 2814), the  appellants challenged the validity of the State Government order amalgamating ‘Extremely  Backward Class’ and ‘Backward Class’ into one group for the purpose of reservation in  professional and educational institutions as violative of Art. 14. It was held that the State  Government’s decision to amalgamate the two classes is unreasonable as two different  classes are treated similarly. Treating unequals as equals is violative of Art. 14. In the absence of new circumstances justifying the aforesaid amalgamation, the government’s decision is arbitrary and unreasonable. In Ashoka Kumar Thakur v UOI (2008) 6 SCC I, the reservation of 27% seats for OBCs in specified State-aided Central Universities under the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2006 was in issue. The Constitution (93rd Amendment) Act, 2005, by which Art. 15(5) was inserted in the Constitution, was basically challenged in these petitions on various grounds. The Act of 2007 was passed by the Parliament consequent upon the 93rd Amendment Act. The Constitution (93rd Amendment) Act, 2005, is challenged on many grounds, viz. if it is allowed to stand it would be against the “basic structure” of the Constitution itself and this Amendment seriously abridges the equality principles guaranteed under Art. 15 and other provisions of the Constitution; the ‘Golden Triangle’ of Arts. 14,19 and 21 is not to be altered and the balance and structure of these constitutional provisions has been ousted by the Amendment Act, 2005. It was contended that the Union Government has failed in performing the constitutional and legal duties towards the citizenry and its resultant effect. Consequentially the Act of 2007 shall have the effect and wide ramifications and ultimately it shall have the result in dividing the country on caste basis. The court observed: Reservation is one of the many tools that are used to preserve and promote the essence of equality, so that disadvantaged groups can be brought to the forefront of civil life. It is the duty of State to promote positive measures to remove barriers of inequality. To cope with the modem world and its complexities and turbulent problems, education is a must and it cannot remain cloistered for the benefit of a privileged few. Reservations provide that extra advantage to persons who, without such support, can forever dream of university education, without ever being able to realise it. This advantage is necessary. However, the fact remains that any reservation or preference shall not lead to ‘reverse discrimination.’ The Apex Court held: The Constitution (93rd Amendment) Act, 2005, does not violate the basic structure of the Constitution so far as it relates to State-maintained 32 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations institutions and aided educational institutions. Equality is a multi-coloured concept incapable of a single definition. The principles of equality cannot be completely taken away so as to leave citizens in a state of lawlessness. But the facets of the principles of equality can always be altered, especially to carry out the directive principles of State policy. If any constitutional amendment is made which moderately abridges the principle of equality, it cannot be said that it violates the basic structure of the Constitution. It has not been held in Keshavananda (1973) 4 SCC 225 that all facets of Art. 14 or any of the fundamental rights would form part of the basic structure. If any one of the provisions relating to a particular basic feature of the Constitution is altered or modified, that does not amount to the alteration of the basic structure. The court also held that Art. 15(5) is constitutionally valid and Arts. 15(4) and 15(5) are not mutually contradictory. But, in the case of Art. 15(5), the minority educational institutions (whether aided or unaided) are excluded from the purview of Art. 15(5). Further, classification of SEBCs cannot be done exclusively on the basis of caste as it would violate Art. 15(1). Poverty, social backwardness, economic backwardness, all are criteria for determination of backwardness. However, it is clear from Indr a Sawhney case that caste itself is not the final destination, that is, caste by itself cannot be determinative of social and educational backwardness, though caste can be the starting point for determination of backwardness. If 49.5% caste-based reservation was upheld in Indra Sawhney case for government employment, it follows that 49.5% caste-based reservation is permitted in aided educational institutions. Indra Sawhney case compels that conclusion that use of caste is valid. Hence, there is no choice but to uphold the impugned legislation by which the Government may still identify SEBCs, in part, by using caste. In Nair Service Society v Dr. T. Beermasthan (2009) 5 SCC 545, it was held: Reservation provisions are enabling provisions. The State is not bound to make a reservation but it is empowered to do so in its own discretion. Different State Governments in the country may have different methods for providing reservations, afid these will be valid as long as the method employed by a particular State Government does not violate any constitutional provision or statute. It is not for the Court to decide on the wisdom or otherwise of the method of reservation. Courts should exercise judicial restraint and not interfere with the same unless there is some clear illegality. In Subhash Chandra v Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board (2009) 15 SCC 458, it was held: There is a distinction between Art. 15(4) and Art. 16(4) of the Constitution. The words “Backward Classes” and “Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes” find place in Art. 15(4) but only the words “backward class of citizens” find place in Art. 16(4). The term “backward class of citizens” contained in Art. 16(4) includes Scheduled Castes/ Tribes for all intent and purport. Therefore, the protection sought to be accorded to a section of the citizenry must not only be to Backward Class but may also be to Scheduled Castes/Tribes for whom a special provision can be made. Indisputably, the classes contemplated by Art.",

Constitution/Constitutional Law 33 Creamy Layer In accordance with the direction given by the Supreme Court the Union Government appointed an expert committee known as Justice Ram Nandan Committee to identity the ‘Creamy Layer’ among the socially and educationally backward classes (SEBC). The Government of India has accepted the report. The report says that certain constitutional posts qualify for the rule of exclusion e.g. posts of President, Vice President, Judges of Supreme and High Courts, Chairman and, ■ members of UPSC and State PCS, Chief Election Commissioners, CAG, Governors, Ministers and Membership of Legislatures. The rule of exclusion covers class I officers of Central and State Services (direct recruits) public sector undertakings, armed forces, professional class including trade, business and industry and property owners. It excludes those having gross annual income of Rupee one lakh and above. The Supreme Court’s judgment, Ashok Kumar Thakur v State o f Bihar and Others (1995) 5 SCC 403 - reiterated that the ‘creamy layer’ among OBCs cannot quality for job reservations under its interpretation of the Mandal Commission recommendations. Reservation In Promotions The Constitution (77th Amendment) Act, 1995 - This amendment has been passed to remove the difficulty created by the Mandal case in which the court had held, that reservation could not be made to promotions in jobs. This amendment has added a new clause (4-A) to Art. 16 which provides that “Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any provision for reservations in the matters of promotion to any class or classes of posts in the services of the State in favour of SCs and STs which, in the opin'io'flj of the State, are not adequately represented in the services under the State.” This means'that the reservation in promotions in government jobs will continue in favour of SCs and STs. ‘Right to promotion’ is ordinarily a'statutory right. It is not a fundamental right. The right to promotion to a post/class of posts depends upon the operation1 o i the conditions of service. Article 16(4-A) read with Arts. 16(1) and 14 guarantees a rignt to promotion to SCs/ STs as a fundamental right where they do not have adequate representation consistently with the efficiency in administration [Ashok Kumar Gupta v State o f U.P. (1997)5 SCC 201], Eighty-fifth Amendment {2001): Amended Clause (4-A) of Art. 16 and substitutes for the words “in matter of promotion to any class” the words “in matters of promotion with consequential seniority, to any class”. It means that the promotion will be given to these classes with retrospective date i.e. 17th June 1995. It nullifies the decision in the Mandal case, wherein it was held that there can be no reservation in promotions. In M. Nagaraj v UOl (AIR 2007 SC 71), the petitioner invoked Art. 32 for a writ in % the nature of certiorari to quash the Constitution (85th Amendment) Act, 2001 inserting Art. 16 (4A) retrospectively from 17-6-1995 providing ‘reservation in promotion with consequential seniority’ for SCs and STs as being unconstitutional and violative of basic structure. The main issue concerned the “extent of reservation” (reservation within reservation). A five-judge Bench unanimously held that Clause (4A) of Art. 16 is an enabling provision. It applies only to SCs and STs. The said clause is carved out of Art. 16(4). Therefore, clause (4A) will be governed by the two compelling reasons 34 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations “backwardness” and “inadequacy of representation” as mentioned in Art. 16(4). If the said two reasons do not exist then the enabling provision cannot come into force. The State can make provision for reservation only if the above two circumstances exist. There is no violation of basic structure of the Constitution by the impugned legislation. Backlog Vacancies The Constitution {81st Amendment) Act, 2000 - This amendment has added a new clause (4- B) to Art. 16 which ends the 50% ceiling on reservation for SC/STs and OBCs in backlog vacancies which could not be filled due to the non-availability of eligible candidates of these classes in the previous year or years. The new clause provides that the unfilled vacancies would be treated as a separate class and would be filled in succeeding year or years and will not be considered together with vacancies of the year in which they are being filled up, even if the 50% limit imposed in the Mandal case is crossed. Marriage and Status of SC/ST In Sandhya Thakur v Vimla Devi Kushwah (2005) 2 SCC 731, it was held that the appellant, who by birth did not belong to a backward class or community, would not be entitled to contest a seat reserved for a backward class or community merely on the basis of her marriage to a male of that community. Also, in Meera Kanwaria v Sunita (AIR 2006 SC 597), it has been held that if a female of high caste Hindu marries a person belonging to Scheduled Caste she is not entitled to take the benefit of reservation under Arts. 15(4) and 16(4) of the Constitution.",

    "content": "in Meera Kanwaria v Sunita (AIR 2006  SC 597), it has been held that if a female of high caste Hindu marries a person belonging  to Scheduled Caste she is not entitled to take the benefit of reservation under Arts. 15(4)  and 16(4) of the Constitution. The court observed and held that a person who is a high caste Hindu and not subjected to any social or educational backwardness in her life, by reason of marriage alone cannot ipso facto become a member of SC/ST. In absence of any strict proof, she cannot be allowed to defeat the very provisions made by the State for reserving certain seats for disadvantaged people. In Sobha Hymavathi Devi v Setti Gangadhar Swamy (AIR 2005 SC 800), it was held that the reservation under Arts. 15(4) or 16(4) or 330 and 332 of the Constitution, would benefit only those who belong to a SC or ST and not those who claim to acquire the status by marriage. The appellant, in the present case, could not claim the right to contest 1 a seat reserved for a Scheduled Tribe in terms of Art, 332 merely by virtue of her marriage to a person belonging to a Scheduled Tribe. In M.C. Vais ala v State o f Kerala (AIR 2006 Ker 1), the issue was whether children bom out of inter-caste married couple could claim the status of SCs/STs for the benefit of reservation in admission to educational institutions and in public employment on the mere fact that one of their parents belonged to SCs /STs. It was observed and held that a particular community, caste, race or tribe or part of group thereof can be declared as SC or ST initially by the President of India and new groups can be added to the lists only by a Parliamentary legislation. The State Government cannot, by an executive' fiat, direct to treat any particular group of persons as SC or ST. There is no legislative competence for the State to do so in the light of Arts. 341 and 342. The caste of person depends on birth. It is, thus, obvious that the government cannot determine the caste of a particular person or class of persons. The burden is on the person who claims the benefit to establish that he/shc is subjected to the same hardship and disadvantages having been bom as a member of SC/ST. I Constitution/ConstitUtional Law 35 ARTICLE 17: Abolition of Untouchability Article 17 abolishes untouchability and forbids its practice in any form. Untouchability is neither defined in the Constitution nor in the Act. It refers to a social practice which looks down upon certain depressed classes solely on account of their birth and makes any discrimination against them on this ground. ‘ V* The Protection o f Civil Rights Act, 1955 [previously Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955] defines ‘Civil Right’ as ‘any right accruing to a person by reason of the abolition of untouchability by Art. 17 of the Constitution.’ The Act prescribes punishment (1-2 years imprisonment) for preventing any person from entering any place of public worship or from worshipping or denying access to any shop, public restaurants, hotels or places' of public entertainment or refusing to admit persons to hospitals and refusing to sell goods or render services to any person. Also, insulting a member of Scheduled Caste on the ground of untouchability or preaching untouchability or justifying it is a crime. Article 15(2) of the Constitution also helps in the eradication of untouchability. In PUDR v UOI (Asiad Project Workers' Case, AIR 1982 SC 1473) the Supreme Court held that the fundamental right under Art. 17 are available against “private individuals” and it is the constitutional duty of the State to take necessary steps to see that these rights are not violated. r». , ARTICLE 18: Abolition of Titles A democracy should not create titles and titular glories. This will go against the realization of social equality. Art. 18 abolishes all titles, k prohibits the State to confer titles on any body whether a citizen or a non-citizen. Military and academic distinctions are, however, exempted from the prohibition. Thus, a university can give title or honour on a man of merit. Clause (2) prohibits a citizen of India from accepting any title from any foreign State. Art. 18 is merely directory as there is no penalty prescribed for infringement of the prohibition. A 'title' (e.g. Sir, Nawab, Maharaja, etc.) means a title of honour, rank, function or office in which there is a distinctive appellation. The recent conferment of titles of “Bharat Ratna”, “Padma Vibhushan”, “Padma Shri”, etc. are spid to be not prohibited under Art. 18 as they merely denote State recognition of good work by citizens in the various fields of activity. In Balaji Raghavan v Union o f India, AIR 1996 SC 770), the Supreme Court upheld the validity of civilian honours but criticized the government for not exercising restraint in awarding these. ARTICLE 19: Right to Freedom Personal liberty is the most important of all fundamental rights. Articles 19-22 deal with different aspects of this basic right. Art. 19 guarantees to the citizens of India the following six fundamental freedoms'. (a) Freedom of Speech and Expression (b) Freedom of Assembly (c) Freedom to form Associations (d) Freedom of movement 36 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations (e) Freedom to reside and to settle (g) Freedom of profession, occupation, trade or business. The freedoms enumerated in Art. 19 (1) are those great and basic rights which are recognized as the natural rights inherent in the status of a citizen. But none of these freedoms is absolute or uncontrolled and may be restricted. A restriction to be constitutionally valid, must satisfy the following two tests: (i) The restriction must be for the purposes mentioned in clauses (2) to (6) of Art. 19. (ii) The restriction must be reasonable.",

    "content": "none of these freedoms is  absolute or uncontrolled and may be restricted. A restriction to be constitutionally valid,  must satisfy the following two tests: (i) The restriction must be for the purposes mentioned  in clauses (2) to (6) of Art. 19. (ii) The restriction must be reasonable. The Supreme Court has laid down the following guidelines: (i) The term “reasonable restriction” connotes that the limitation imposed on a person in the enjoyment of his right should not be arbitrary or of an excessive nature beyond what is actually required in the interest of public. The word “reasonable” implies intelligent care and deliberation, i.e. choice of a course which reason dictates. Reasonableness has to be determined in an objective manner. Each case is to be judged on its own merit. (ii) The expression “reasonable restriction” seeks to strike a balance between the individual rights guaranteed by Art. 19 and social control permitted by Art. 19(2}-{6). A restriction which is imposed for securing the objects laid down in Directive Principles of State Policy, may be regarded as reasonable. (iii) The restrictions on the rights can only be imposed by,a “law” and not executive or departmental instructions. » (iv) It is the courts and not the legislature which has to judge finally the reasonableness of restriction (both substantive and procedural). A law may be reasonable, but restriction imposed by it on the exercise of freedom may not be reasonable. Rights available to ‘citizens’ only - ‘Citizens’ under Art. 19 mean only natural persons and not legal persons, such as corporations or companies. But, the Bank Nationalization Case has established the view that the fundamental rights of shareholders, editors, and printers, as citizens are not lost when they associate to form a company. Art. 19 (1) (a): Freedom of Speech and Expression Article 19( 1 )(a) says that all citizens shall have the right “to freedom of speech and expression”. But, this right is subject to limitations imposed under Art. 19(2) which empowers the State to put ‘reasonable’ restrictions on the following grounds: “security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order; decency and morality, contempt of court, defamation, incitement to offence, and, sovereignty and integrity of India”. The freedom of speech and expression means the right to express one’s convictions, and opinioni freely by word of mouth, writing, printing, pictures or any other mode. It also includes the right to propagate or publish the views of other people, otherwise this freedom would not include the ‘freedom of press’. The fundamental principle involved here is the people’s right to know. In National Anthem case (1986) 3 SCC 615, held that the freedom under Art. 19(l)(a) also includes the freedom o f silence. Freedom of Press Unlike the American Constitution, Art. 19(1) (a) does not expressly mention the liberty of Constitution/Constitutional Law 37 press i.e. the freedom to print and to publish what one pleases without previous permission. But it is settled law that the right to freedom of speech and expression includes the liberty of the press. Press is supposed to guard public interest by bringing to fore the misdeeds, failings and lapses of the government and other bodies exercising governing power. Rightly, therefore, it has been described as the Fourth Estate. In Bennett Coleman’s case (AIR 1973 SC 106), held that the freedom of newspapers to publish any number of pages or to circulate it to any number of persons and to fix price is each an integral part of the freedom of speech and expression. Freedom of press is both quantitative and qualitative. Freedom lies both in circulation and its content (news and views). In Sakai Paper's case (AIR 1962 SC 305), held that the freedom of speech could not be restricted for the purpose of regulating the commercial aspects of activities of the newspapers. In Express Newspaper v Union o f India (AIR 1958 SC 578), held that a law which imposes pre-censorship (censorship prior to publication) or prevents newspapers from being started or require them to seek government aid in order to survive was violative of Art. I9(lXa). In Express Newspaper s case, held that the press industry is not free from taxation, but tax should be within reasonable limits and does not impede freedom of expression i.e. circulation. In Rajagopal v State ofT.N. (1994) 6 SCC 632, held that the press have the right to publish an unauthorized account of a citizen’s life (autobiography of a convict accused of several murders) in so far as it. js based upon public records. Freedom of the press, the court said, means absence of interference by the State except insofar as it is authorized by the Constitution and by laws. In A jay Goswami v UOI (AIR 2007 SC 493), the ‘freedom of press’ was in issue. The court recognized the right of adults to entertainment within the acceptable level of decency on the ground that it may not be appropriate for children. “Fertile imagination” of minors should not be a matter that should be agitated in court of law. The court considered the applicability of American test of “clear and present danger”. Advertisement, Demonstration, and Films: Whether Protected under Art. 19(lXa)? ‘Advertisement’ is undoubtedly a form of speech. But every form of ad is not a form of speech or expression of ideas e.g. social, political, literary, etc. An ad of a ‘commercial’ nature is not protected under Art. 19( 1 )(a). Such ad has an element of trade and commerce. Professionals like doctors, lawyers and C.A. are legally forbidden to advertise their services. In Tata Press v M.T.N.Lt (1995) 5 SCC 139, the Court declared that the right to “Commercial Speech” or advertisement is part of the freedom of speech guaranteed by Art. 19(l)(a). A private agency like Tata Press is, therefore, entitled to bring out yellow pages comprising advertisements, the annual buyer’s guide for Bombay. ‘Demonstration’ or ‘picketing’ are visible manifestation of one’s ideas and in effect a form of speech and expression.",

In Tata Press v M.T.N.Lt (1995) 5 SCC 139, the Court declared that the right to  “Commercial Speech” or advertisement is part of the freedom of speech guaranteed by  Art. 19(l)(a). A private agency like Tata Press is, therefore, entitled to bring out yellow  pages comprising advertisements, the annual buyer’s guide for Bombay. ‘Demonstration’ or ‘picketing’ are visible manifestation of one’s ideas and in effect  a form of speech and expression. They are protected under Art. 19(l)(a) provided they are not violent and disorderly. ‘Right to strike’ is not included within the ambit of freedom of speech. In T.K. Rangarajan v State ofT.N. (AIR 2003 SC 3032), held that Government servants have no legal or statutory right to go on strike. In the year 2002, the Government of Tamil Nadu terminated the services of 2 lakh employees under the T.N. Essential Services Maintenance Act, 2002; the government employees had gone on strike for their demands. The court said that “Government employees cannot hold society to ransom by 38 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations going on strike”. If the employees felt aggrieved by any Government action, they should seek redressal -from the statutory machinery provided under different statutory provisions. The court said strike as a weapon is mostly misused which results in chaos and total mal­ administration. Though the trade unions have a guaranteed “right for collective bargaining” on behalf of employees, they have no fundamental right to strike under Art. 19(l)(c). A Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in Harish Uppal v UOl (AIR 2003 SC 739), categorically pronounced that the lawyers had no right to go on strike or give a call for boycott, not even a token strike. It has been suggested that the Advocates can get redressal of their grievances by passing resolutions, making representations and taking out silent processions, holding dharnas or to resort to relay fast, having discussion by giving T.V. interviews and press statements. In James Martin v State o f Kerala (2004) 2 SCC 203, it was held that no person has any right to destroy another’s property in the guise of bandh or hartal or strike, irrespective of the proclaimed reasonableness of the cause or the question whether there is or was any legal sanction for the same. There is need to control such acts with an iron hand. It has been held that the freedom of expression under Art. 19(l)(a) includes the freedom to “fly the national flag” by a citizen at his home, office or business place (Navin Kumar Jindal v Union o f India, 1995). In Union o f India v Navin Jindal (2004) 2 SCC 410, the Supreme Court made certain important observations in respect to the flying of the National Flag: (i) Right to fly the National Flag freely with respect and dignity is a fundamental right of a citizen within the meaning of Art. 19 (l)(a) being an expression and manifestation of his allegiance and feelings and sentiments of pride for the nation. However, such right is not an absolute right but a qualified one being subject to reasonable restrictions under Art. 19(2). 00 The Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950 and the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971 regulate the use of the National Flag. (iii) Flag Code although is not a law within the meaning of Art. 13 (3) of the Constitution of India, for the purpose of Art. 19 (2) it would not restrictively regulate the free exercise of the right of flying the National Flag. However, the Flag Code to the extent it provides for preserving respect and dignity of the National Flag, the same deserves to be followed. (iv) For the purpose of interpretation of the constitutional scheme and for the purpose of maintaining a balance between the fundamental/legal rights of a citizen vis-a-vis, the regulatory measures/restrictions, both Parts IV and IV- A of the Constitution can be taken recourse to. ‘Pre-Censorship of films’ justified under Art. 19(2) on the ground that films have to be treated separately from other forms of art and expression because a motion picture was able to stir up emotions more deeply. Hence, classification of films into ‘A’ & ‘U’ categories held to be valid in K.A. Abbas v Union o f India (AIR 1971 SC 481). Right of citizens to exhibit films on Doordarshan subject to the terms and conditions to be imposed by the Doordarshan is a part of the fundamental right of freedom o f expression (Odyssey Communications Pvt. Ltd. v Lokvidayan Sangathan AIR 1988 SC 1642). Constitulion/Constitutional Law 39 In Union o f India v Motion Pictures Asscn. (AIR 1999 SC 2334), held that the compulsion for cinema owners to show scientific/educational films do not infringe their freedom of speech guaranteed under Art. 19(1 )(a) of the Constitution. ‘Compelled speech’, often known as a ‘must carry’ provision in a Statute, Rule or Regulation, can be an infringement of the right to free speech, except to the extent permitted under Art. 19 (2). In LlC v Manubhai D. Shah (1992) 3 SCC 637, the Supreme Court held that the freedom of speech and expression includes freedom of circulation and propagation of ideas and ‘therefore’ the right extends to the citizen to use the media to answer the criticism levelled against his views propagated by him. A “right to reply’ (by a dissonant note) is implied in the system of Freedom of Expression. The Secretary, Ministry o f I & B v Cricket Association, Bengal with Cricket Association, Bengal v Union o f India (AIR 1995 SC 1236) is a landmark judgment as it recognizes the 'right to information' as part of the fundamental right to speech and expression under Art. 19(1 )(a). The court observed that a citizen has a fundamental right to use the best means of imparting and receiving information through “electronic media”.",

    "content": "Secretary, Ministry o f I & B v Cricket Association, Bengal with Cricket  Association, Bengal v Union o f India (AIR 1995 SC 1236) is a landmark judgment as it  recognizes the 'right to information' as part of the fundamental right to speech and  expression under Art. 19(1 )(a). The court observed that a citizen has a fundamental right  to use the best means of imparting and receiving information through “electronic media”. Albeit with a caveat: the airwaves are a public resource and must, therefore, be regulated in the public interest. The court ruled that the freedom of speech and expression includes the right to educate, inform and entertain. ‘Sport’ is an expression o f self. The Government can impose restrictions on such a right only on grounds specified in Art. 19(2). State monopoly on electronic media is not mentioned in Art. 19(2). In Union o f India v Asscn. for Democratic Reforms (AIR 2002 SC 2112), it was held that the voter’s right to know antecedents including criminal past of a candidate to membership of Parliament or Legislative Assembly is a fundamental right covered under Art. 19 (1) (a), and. Art. 19 (1) and (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966. The Apex Court observed: The right to get information in a democracy is recognized all throughout and it is a natural right flowing from the concept of democracy. The people of the country have a right to know every public act, everything that is done in a public way by the public functionaries. MPs or MLAs are undoubtedly public functionaries. The right to freedom of speech and expression does not entitle a person to commit ‘contempt of court’ [In Re Arundhati Roy AIR 2002 SC 1375; Radha Mohan Lai v Rajasthan High Court AIR 2003 SC 1467]. The law relating to the Contempt of Courts imposes reasonable restrictions on the freedom and within the ambit of Art. 19 (2) [.Narmada Bachao Andolan v UOl AIR 1999 SC 3345]. Art. 19 (1) (b): Freedom to Assemble Art. 19 (l)(b) secures to all citizens of India the right “to assemble peaceably and without arms”. Thus, there is a right to hold public meetings and demonstrations and take out processions peacefully. Under Art. 19 (3), reasonable restrictions can be imposed on the right by the State by law “in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India or public order”. Thus, an assembly declared unlawful can be validly banned. Art. 1 9 (1) (c): Freedom of Association Art. 19 (l)(c) guarantee to all citizens the right “to form associations and unions for pursuing lawful purposes”. Under Art. 19 (4), however, reasonable restrictions can be imposed by the State “in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India or public 40 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations order or morality”. The associations so formed would include political parties, societies, clubs, companies, organizations, partnership firms, trade unions and indeed any body of persons. It has been held that this Article does not guarantee a ‘right to strike’. In dharam Dull v UOl (AIR 2004 SC 1295), the Supreme Court held that a right to form associations or unions does not include within its ken as a fundamental right a right to form associations or unions for achieving a particular object or running a particular institution, the same being a concomitant or concomitant to a concomitant of a fundamental right, but not the fundamental right itself. The associations or unions of citizens cannot further claim as a fundamental right that they must also be able to achieve the purpose for which they have come into existence so that any interference with such achievement by law shall be unconstitutional, unless the same could be justified under Art. 19 (4). Art. 1 9 (1) (d) & (e): Freedom of Movem ent and Residence The right of every citizen of India “to move freely throughout the territory of India” and his right “to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India” guaranteed under clauses (d) and (e) respectively of Art. 19 (1) are really interlinked. Both the rights lay stress on the oneness of the territory of India. Any citizen can travel to or reside in any part of India. Art. 19 (5), however, provides for imposition of reasonable restrictions on the exercise of these rights by law “in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe”. Generally, the protection afforded by these rights is invoked to challenge the validity of extemment or deportation orders which go to curtail the two freedoms. Restrictions imposed on prostitutes to carry on their trade within a specified area and to reside in or move from particular areas have been held to be valid. Likewise, restrictions on residence imposed on habitual offenders have been upheld. Restrictions on the movement of persons afflicted by AIDS have also been upheld. No political party has the right to call for ‘bandh’ on the plea that it is a part of its fundamental right of speech and expression under Art. 19(1 )(a). The calling for and holding o f ‘bandh’ by a political party/organization involved a threat, express or implied, to citizen not to carry on his activities or to practice his avocation on the day of the ‘bandh’ and hence violative of Arts. 19(l)(a) (b) (c) (d) and 21. Calling for a bandh is different from calling for hartal or strike having regard to the effect of bandh on the fundamental right of the people ‘as a whole’ [Communist Party o f India (M) v Bharat Kumar AIR 1998 SC 184], Art. 19 (1) (g): Freedom of Profession and Trade Under Art. 19 (l)(g) every citizen of India has the right “to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business”. This right is also not absolute and the State can impose reasonable restrictions “in the interest of the general public”. Under Art.",

    "content": "(l)(g) every citizen of India has the right “to practice any profession or to  carry on any occupation, trade or business”. This right is also not absolute and the State  can impose reasonable restrictions “in the interest of the general public”. Under Art. 19(6) the State has also been empowered to prescribe professional or technical qualifications necessary for practicing and profession or carrying on any occupation, trade or business, as well as for enabling the State to carry on any trade or business to the exclusion of citizens wholly or partially. In fact the State is competent to nationalize any trade or to monopolize a trade. Constitution/ConstituHonal Law 41 In B.R. Enterprises v State o f U.P. (AIR 1999 SC 1867), it was held that the right of sale of lottery tickets is not a right under Art. 301 or Art. 19 (I) (g). Lottery has been held to be gambling. In it, there is no skill but only an element of chance, it falls outside the realm of res commercium. Even State lotteries cannot be said to constitute “trade” as contemplated by Art. 301. A person has no fundamental right to carry on trade to the detriment of others (viz. causing of pollution, noise, etc.) (Abhilash Textiles Ltd. v Rajkot Municipal Corporation AIR 1988 Guj 57). In Noise Pollution (K), In re (2005) 5 SCC 733, it was held that the right to speech implies the ‘right to silence’. It implies freedom, not to listen, and not to be forced to listen. Free speech is not to be treated as a promise to everyone with opinions and beliefs, to gather at any place and at any time and express their views in any manner. A person can decline to read a publication, or switch off a radio or television set. But, he cannot prevent the sound from a loudspeaker reaching him. He could be forced to hear what he wishes not to hear. No one has a right to trespass on the mind or ear of another and commit auricular or visual aggression. In T.M.A. Pai Foundation v State o f Karnataka (2002) 8 SCC 481, the Supreme Court for the first time brought into existence the concept of education as an “occupation\", a term used in Art. 19 (l)(g) of the Constitution. The fundamental right to establish and run educational institutions is thus subject to reasonable restrictions under Art. 19 (4). In State o f Gujarat v Mirzapur Moti Qureshi Kassab Jamet (AIR 2006 SC 212), it was held that the prohibition of slaughter of cows and her progeny does not amount to total ban on activity of butchers. It is not a prohibition but only a restriction. They can slaughter animals other than cow progeny and carry on their activity. Cow and her progeny are the backbone of Indian agriculture and economy. Thus, the ban on slaughter of cow progeny is in the interest of general public and is reasonable restriction within the meaning of Art. 19(6) of the Constitution. It is not violative of the fundamental right to carry on trade and business under Art. 19(l)(g) of the Constitution. ARTICLE 20: Protection In Respect of Conviction for Offences Under Art. 20, the Constitution of India has taken care to safeguard the rights of persons accused of crimes. This Article cannot be suspended even during an emergency by an order under Art. 359. Art. 2 0 (1): Ex-Post Facto Law According to Art. 20 (1), “no person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of law in force at the time of commission of the act charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of commission of offence”. Thus, the legislature is prohibited to make criminal laws having retrospective effect. Art. 20 (1) is not applicable to a trial or a civil liability or preventive detention case. Art. 2 0 (2): Double Jeopardy Article 20 (2) provides that “no person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once”. The principle of double jeopardy has been already recognized in the Sec. 26, General Clauses Act and Sec. 300, Cr. P.C. The protection afforded by Art. 20 (2) is. 42- Law Guide for Competitive Examinations however, attracted only in respect of punishment inflicted by court of law or judicial tribunal. .Thus, a Government servant prosecuted and convicted by a court of law can be punished under departmental proceedings for the same offence. Similarly, it does not ban proceedings before a civil court for disobedience of an injunction along with criminal proceedings. Art. 2 0 (3): Protection Against Self-Incrlmlnatlon Art. 20 (3) lays down that “no person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself’. In other words, the accused person is protected against incriminating himself under compulsion e.g. ‘making a statement which makes the case against the accused person at least probable considered by itself. Compulsion in this context would mean “duress” (State of Bombay v Kathi Kolu Oghad AIR 1961 SC 1808). In NandiniSathpathy v P.L. Dani (AIR 1978 SC 1025), the Supreme Court held that “relevant replies which furnish a real and clear link in the chain of evidence indeed to bind down the accused with the crime become incriminatory and offend Art. 20 (3) if elicited by pressure from the mouth of the accused”. It widened the scope of compulsion and held that “compelled testimony” is evidently procured not merely by physical threats or violence but also by psychic torture, atmospheric pressure, environmental coercion, tiring interrogative proximity, overbearing and intimidating methods and the like. In Sampath Kumar v E.O. Enforcement Directorate, Madras (AIR 1998 SC 16), held that administration of “caution” to person summoned that not making truthful statement was an offence, did not amount to use of pressure within the meaning of Art. 20 (3).",

    "content": "Sampath Kumar v E.O. Enforcement Directorate, Madras (AIR 1998 SC 16), held  that administration of “caution” to person summoned that not making truthful statement  was an offence, did not amount to use of pressure within the meaning of Art. 20 (3). Administration of such a caution, the Court said, was, in fact, in the interest of the person who was making the statement. The privilege given by Art. 20 (3) to the accused person may be waived by him. Thus, this Article is not violated when he volunteers evidence against himself. Further, the immunity granted to the accused does not extend to compulsory production of material objects or compulsion to give specimen writing/ signature, finger impression or giving of blood specimens. Also, compulsion for production of documents is prohibited only if the documents convey the personal knowledge of the accused relating to the charge. Search of the premises of a person accused of an offence under a search warrant and seizure of the documents are not violative of Art. 20 (3). ARTICLE 21: Protection of Life and Personal Liberty Art. 21 reads: ‘Wo person shall be deprived o f his life or personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law.\" After the Maneka Gandhis decision. Art. 21 now protects the right of life and personal liberty not only from the executive action but from the legislative action also. The right guaranteed in Art. 21 is available to citizens as well as non-citizens (Chairman, Railway Board v Chandrima Das AIR 2000 SC 988). Art. 21-A (Right to Education) Inserted by the 86th Constitution Amendment Act, 2002: \"The State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children between the age o f 6 and 14 years in such manner as the State may, by law, determine.\" Constitution/Constitutional Law 43 Eighty-sixth Amendment (93rd Amendment Bill) has added Art. 2I-A after Art. 21 making the ‘right of education’ of children of the age of 6-14 years a Fundamental Right. Every child/citizen has right to free education until he completes the age of 14 years. Thereafter, his right to education is “subject to the limits o f economic capacity and development o f the State.\" Personal liberty: Meaning and Scope In A.K. Copalan’s case (AIR 1950 SC 27), the court took the view that ‘personal liberty’ only means ‘liberty relating to or concerning the person or body of the individual’. In England, the expression has been understood in the restricted sense. Dicey has said, “right to personal liberty means a person’s right not to be subjected to imprisonment, arrest, or other physical coercion in any manner that does not admit of legal justification”. But, in Kharak Singh v State o f Punjab (AIR 1963 SC 1295), the term ‘personal liberty’ was interpreted to be a compendious term including within itself all the varieties of rights which go to make up the personal liberty of man other than those dealt with in Art. 19(1). While Art. 19(1) deals with particular species or attributes of that freedom, ‘personal liberty’ in Art. 21 takes in and comprises the residue. In R. C. Cooper v Union o f India (AIR 1970 SC 564), it was held that each freedom has different dimensions and there may be overlapping between different fundamental rights and therefore it is not a valid argument to say that the expression ‘personal liberty’ in Art. 21 must be so interpreted as to avoid overlapping between that Art. 21 and Art. 19(1). In Maneka Gandhi v Union o f India (AIR 1978 SC 597), Bhagwati J. observed: “The expression ‘personal liberty’ is of widest amplitude and it covers a variety of rights which go to constitute the personal liberty of man and some of them have raised to the status of distinct fundamental rights and given additional protection under Art. 19. Art. 21 is controlled by Arts. 14 and 19. The concept of reasonableness must be projected in the procedure contemplated by Art. 21 having regard to the impact of Art. 14 on Art. 21.” The interaction of Articles 14, 19 and 21 analyzed by the Court in this case, demonstrates that the requirement of ‘reasonableness’ runs like ‘a golden thread through the entire fabric of fundamental rights’. In Francis Coralie v Delhi Admn. (AIR 1981 SC 746), held that the word ‘personal liberty’ is of widest amplitude and it includes the ‘right to socialize' (by a detenu) with members of family and friends subject to reasonable prison regulations. Detenu’s right to have interview with his lawyer and family member is part of his ‘personal liberty’ guaranteed by Art. 21. Right to ‘live’ is not merely confined to physical existence but it includes within its ambit the right to live with human dignity (vide Maneka Gandhi case), and all that goes along with it, namely, the bare necessities of life such as adequate nutrition, clothing, and shelter, and facilities for reading, writing, and expressing ourselves in diverse forms, freely moving about and mixing with fellow human beings. Scope o f 'procedure established by law ’ - The term ‘procedure established by law’ is a narrower term in comparison to the term ‘due process of law’, because the former includes only procedural law (C.P.C, Cr. P.C. etc.) while the latter includes both substantive law (I.P.C., Hindu Marriage Act, etc.) and procedural law. The phrase ‘due process of law’ is used in the American Constitution. In Maneka Gandhi fcase, Bhagwati J. did not applied the concept of “due process” as such in the context of Art. 21, when he stated that the protection secured by Art. 21 44 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations is a limited one in as much as Art. 21 safeguards the right to ‘personal liberty’ against executive interference which is not supported by law, and law here means ‘enacted law’ or ‘State law’. However, he read ‘procedure’ in Art.",

    "content": "not applied the concept of “due process”  as such in the context of Art. 21, when he stated that the protection secured by Art. 21 44 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations is a limited one in as much as Art. 21 safeguards the right to ‘personal liberty’ against  executive interference which is not supported by law, and law here means ‘enacted law’  or ‘State law’. However, he read ‘procedure’ in Art. 21 not as prescribing any specific procedure, but only that procedure which conforms to the principles of natural justice i.e. procedure has to be ‘fair, right and just’. Further, Krishna Iyer J., extended the guarantee in Art. 21 not only to ‘procedure’ as being fair and just, but also to ‘law’ as being ‘reasonable’; it meant in a way reading ‘procedure established by law’ as almost amounting to ‘due process of law’ in the American sense. Im plied Fundam ental Rights under Art. 2 1 A new judicial trend has emerged from the cases of Maneka Gandhi. Sunil Batra, Hoskot and Hussainara Khatoon, in which the Supreme Court has taken the view that the provisions of Part III of the Constitution of India should be given widest possible interpretation. In Maneka Gandhi’s case, Bhagwati J., said, “the correct way o f interpreting the provisions o f Part 111 is that attempt o f the court should be to expand the reach and ambit o f the fundamental rights rather than to attenuate their meaning and content.\" Article 21 is worded in negative terms as it prohibits or restricts State’s actions, rather than require it to do something beneficial for the citizens, a positive aspect. By an activist interpretation most of the fundamental rights, especially the right to equality (Art. 14) freedom of speech and expression [Art. 19(l)(a)] and right to life and personal liberty (Art. 21) have been converted into a regime of positive human rights unknown in previous constitutional diction. By an affirmative action the courts are trying to force the government to create favourable conditions for effective realization of the new individual, collective, diffuse rights. The Supreme Court has held that to be a fundamental right it is not necessary that a right must be specifically mentioned in a particular Article. Even if it is not mentioned in any of the Articles specifically, it may be a fundamental right if it is an integral part o f a named fundamental right or partakes o f the same basic nature and character as that fundamental right. Every activity which facilitates the exercise of the named fundamental right may be considered integral part of that right and hence be a fundamental right. The discoveries of egalitarian goals in the fundamental rights have resulted in the explosion of rights. Thus, Article 21 of the Constitution has sprung up a whole lot of human rights jurisprudence. For example, it has been held that these are fundamental rights under Article 21, though not specifically mentioned: (0 Right to speedy trial (M.H. Hoskot v State o f Maharashtra, AIR 1978 SC 1548; Hussainara Khatoon v State o f Bihar, AIR 1980 SC 1819; Raj Deo Sharma v State o f Bihar ( 1998) 7 SCC 507). (it-) Right to travel abroad (Maneka Gandhi’s case). (iii) Right to dignity (Maneka Gandhi, Francis Coralie cases). (iv) Right to privacy (Govind v State o f M.P.). (v) Right to clean environment (M.C. Mehta v Union o f India). (vi) Right to livelihood (Olga Tellis case). (vii) Rieht to education (Mohini Jain and Unni Krishnan cases). Constitution/Constitutional Law 45 (viii) Right to die (Rathinam v Union o f India). (ix) Right against torture (Sunil Balra v Delhi Admn., AIR 1980 SC 1979; Jolly Varghese v Bank o f Cochin, AIR 1980 SC 470; Khatri v Slate o f Bihar (1981) 1 SCC 623). (x) Right against bondage (Bandhua Mukti Morcha case). People's Union For Democratic Rights v Union of India, (1982) 2 S.C.C. 235; Neeraja Chaudhary v State ofM.P., (1984) 3 SCC 243). (xi) Right to legal aid (Sheela Barse v Union o f India, (1986) 3 S.C.C. 632; Suk Das case, (1986) 2 SCC 401). (xii) Right to food (PUCL v UOl 2000 (5) SCALE). Similarly, the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Art. 19 (I) (a) includes the right to know, right to information, right to reply etc. Freedom of press is inferred from the freedom of speech and expression. In State ofM.P. v Ram Kishan Balothia (AIR 1995 SC 1198), held that anticipatory bail cannot be granted as a matter of right. It is essentially a statutory right. Similarly, the ‘right to vote’ is a statutory right and not a fundamental/ common law right. The right to vote is subject to the limitations imposed by the statute, and the challenge to any provision in the statute prescribing the nature of right to elect cannot be made with reference to a fundamental right in the Constitution. Thus, Prisoners/Under trials cannot claim a right to vote (Anukul Chandra Pradhan v Union o f India AIR 1997 SC 2814). Case Law (0 In R. Rajagopal v State ofT.N. (1994) 6 SCC 632, held that the “right to privacy” is included in Art. 21 and a “citizen has a right to safeguard the privacy of his own, his family, marriage, procreation, motherhood, child bearing and education among other matters”. In State of Maharashtra v Madhidkar Narain (AIR 1991 SC 207), it was held that this right is available even to a woman of easy virtue, and no one can invade her privacy. Right against “sexual harassment in work places” has been recognized in Vishaka v State o f Rajasthan (AIR 1997 SC 3011).",

    "content": "against “sexual harassment in work places” has been recognized in Vishaka v State  o f Rajasthan (AIR 1997 SC 3011). Also, in Apparel Export Promotion Council v A.K. Chopra (AIR 1999 SC 625), the Supreme Court applied the law laid down in Vishaka's case and upheld the dismissal from service of a superior officer who was found guilty of “sexual harassment” of a subordinate female employee at the place of work on the ground that it violated her fundamental rights guaranteed by Art. 21 (right to dignity) and Art. 14. A Bill (Mo. XI of 1998) to provide for the prevention of sexual harassment of women employees at their work places has been introduced in the Parliament. Sec. 2 (c) of the Bill defines “sexual harassment” as including any unwanted verbal or gestrual sexual advances, sexually implicit and derogatory statements or remarks, avoidable physical contacts, touching or patting, suggestive remarks, sexually slanted and obscene jokes, comments about physical appearance, compromising invitations, use of pornographic material, demands for sexual favours, threats, innuendoes, physical assault and molestation of and towards women workers by their male superiors, colleagues or anyone who for the time being is in a position to sexually harass the women workers. 46 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations When a person is talking on telephone, he is exercising his right to freedom of speech and expression. “Telephone-tapping” unless it comes within the grounds of restrictions under Art. 19(2) would infract Art. 19 (l)(a)” (People’s Union for Civil Liberties v Union of India AIR 1997 SC 568). The judgment of the Supreme Court will go a long way in protecting the ‘right of privacy’ of Indian citizens enshrined under Art. 21. In State o f Bihar v Lai Krishna Advani (AIR 2003 SC 3357), the Apex Court made it clear that one was entitled to have and preserve one’s reputation and one also had a right to protect it. In R.D. Upadhayay v State o f Andhra Pradesh (AIR 2006 SC 1946), the Apex Court showing serious concern regarding the plight of children living in jails with prisoner mothers issued detailed directions for their interest regarding food, shelter, medical care, clothing, education and recreation facilities which are declared to be child’s right. The court directed that the child above 6 years not to be kept with female prisoners. Birth of child in prison is not to be recorded as ‘prison’ in Birth Certificate. In Lata Singh v State o f U.P. (AIR 2006 SC 2522), it was held that the right to life includes ‘right to marriage’ A major boy or girl undergoing inter-caste or inter-religious marriage are to be protected from harassment, threats or acts of violence. Stern action should be taken against person who give threats or harass or commit violences Right to Privacy o f an AIDS Patient - In Mr. X ' v Hospital ‘Z ’ (Dr. Tokugha Yepthomi v Appollo Hospital AIR 1999 SC 495) held that the ‘right to privacy’ is not absolute. Where there is a clash of two fundamental rights, namely, the appellant’s right to privacy as part of right to life and his fiancee’s right to lead a healthy life which is her fundamental right under Art. 21, the right that would advance the public morality or public interest, would alone be enforced through the process of court. Thus, the hospital authorities could waive confidentiality in the public interest. In Mr. X ’ v Hospital ‘Z ’ (AIR 2003 SC 664), the Supreme Court partly overruled the earlier decision (AIR 1999 SC 495) and confined it to that “it was open to the hospital or the doctor concerned to reveal information about the ‘AIDS status’ of a person to persons related to the girl whom he intended to marry and she had a right to know about the HIV positive status of the appellant.” (ii) In Olga Tellis v Bombay Municipal Corpn. (AIR 1986 SC 180), (also known as pavement dwellers' case), the court held that the world life in Art. 21 includes the right to livelihood also, because no person can live without the means of livelihood. (iii) In Shiv Sagar Tiwari v Union o f India (AIR 1997 SC 2725), the out-of-tum allotments of Government residential quarters on ‘special compassionate ground’ in Delhi were in issue. The Supreme Court while recognizing the ‘right to shelter’ emphasized the need to prevent or regulate “illegal shelter”. (iv) The Supreme Court (A/. C. Mehta cases) and High Courts in India have interpreted the right to life and personal liberty to include the “right to a wholesome environment.\" In T. Damodhar Rao v Municipal Corpn. of Hyderabad (AIR 1987 AP 171), the court held that the enjoyment o f life and its attainment and fulfillment guaranteed by Art. 21 embraces the protection and preservation o f nature's gifts without which life cannot be enjoyed. Constitution/Constitutional Law 47 In Kinkri Devi v State o f H.P. (AIR 1988 HP 4), the court held that if a just balance is not struck between development through tapping of natural resources and the protection of ecology and environment, there will be a violation of fundamental rights conferred by Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. In Subhash Kumar v State o f Bihar (AIR 1991 SC 420), the court held the right to live includes the right of enjoyment of pollution-free water and air for full enjoyment of life. In Murli S. Deora v UOI (2001) 8 SCC 765, realizing the gravity of the situation and considering the adverse effect of smoking on smokers and passive smokers, the court directed and prohibited smoking in public places and issued direction to the Union of India, State Governments and UTs to take effective steps to ensure prohibiting smoking in public places. In N.D. Jayal v UO/ (AIR 2004 SC 867), it was held that right to clean environment and right to development are integral parts of human rights covered by Art. 2 1.",

    "content": "N.D. Jayal v UO/ (AIR 2004 SC 867), it was held that right to clean environment  and right to development are integral parts of human rights covered by Art. 2 1. Sustainable development is a means to achieve the object and purpose of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 as well as protection of “life” envisaged under Art. 21 of the Constitution. The construction of dam (Tehri Dam) is a component of development and a strict compliance with the Environment Act is necessary. In Intellectuals Forum, Tirupathi v State o f Andhra Pradesh (AIR 2006 SC 1350), the Supreme Court has held that under Art. 21 and Art. 51-A, it is the constitutional obligation of the Government to protect and preserve the environment. In the name of urban development, the environment (fresh water resources in the present case) cannot be destroyed. Emphasising the need of sustainable development, the court held that the right of shelter is not so pressing need so as to outweigh all environmental considerations. As per the doctrine of 'public trust’, the natural resources which includes lakes are held by the State as a trustee of public, and can be disposed of only in a manner that is consistent with nature of such trust. In Milk Men Colony Vikas Samiti v State o f Rajasthan (2007) 2SCC 413, the Supreme Court held that the ‘right to life’ means clean surroundings which lead to healthy body and mind. It includes right to freedom from stray cattle and animals in urban areas. (v) In Mohini Jain v State o f Karnataka (AIR 1992 SC 1858), the Supreme Court held that every citizen has a \"right to education' under the Constitution. The right to education is concomitant to the fundamental rights. Thus, right to freedom of speech and expression cannot be fully enjoyed unless a citizen is educated and conscious of individualistic dignity. Right to education is implicit in right to life because of its inherent fundamental importance (in the life of an individual). The State is under a constitutional mandate to provide education at all levels (including professional education like medicine, engineering) for citizens. In Unni Krishnan v State o f A.P. (“Capitation Fee Case\") (AIR 1993 SC 2178), the five- judge bench which was constituted to review the two-judge bench decision of the court in Mohini Jain’s case, by 3-2 majority held that admission to all recognized private educational institutions particularly medical and engineering, shall be based on merit (\"free seats”), but 50% of seats in all professional colleges be filled by candidates prepared to pay a higher fee (“payment seats”). 48 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations (vi) In Consumer Education & Research Centre v Union o f India (AIR 1995 SC 922), the Supreme Court has held that the “right to health and medical care” is a fundamental right under Art. 21 as it is essential for making the life of the workmen meaningful and purposeful with dignity of person. ‘Right to life’ in Art. 21 includes protection of the health and strength of the worker. (vii) The Bombay High Court in case of State o f Maharashtra v Marut'i Sripati Dubai (HT, Oct. 12, 1986), held that the right to live guaranteed by Art. 21 include also a “right to die”. In Rathinam v Union o f India (1994) 2 SCALE VOL II No. 7674, the Supreme Court held that a person has a right to die and declared unconstitutional Sec. 309,1.P.C., which makes attempt to commit suicide a penal offence. The right to live in Art. 21 includes the right not to live i.e. right to die. A person can't be forced to enjoy right to life to his detriment, disadvantage or disliking. But, the court rejected the plea that euthanasia (mercy killing) should be permitted by law. There is a distinction between an attempt of a person to take his life and action of some others to bring to an end the life of a third person. In Gian Kaur v State o f Punjab (1996) 2 SCC 648, a five judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court overruled the P. Rathinam’s case and held that ‘right to life’ under Art. 21 does not include ‘right to die’ or ‘right to be killed’. The ‘right to die’ is inherently inconsistent with the ‘right to life’ as is ‘death with life’. The Court accordingly held that Sec. 309 of I PC is not violative of Art. 21. (viii) In State o f U.P. v Raj Narain (AIR 1975 SC 865), the court held that the people have a “right to know” every public act, everything that is done in a public way, by their public functionaries. In S.P Gupta v Union o f India (AIR 1982 SC 149), the court recognized the right to know to be implicit in the right to free speech and expression i.e. Art. 19(l)(a). In Reliance Petrochemical Ltd. v Proprietors o f Indian Express Newspapers Bombay Pvt. Ltd. (AIR 1989 SC 190) the court recognized the right to know as emanating from the right to life i.e. Art. 21. (ix) In PUCL v UOl (2000), recognizing the ‘right to food’ the Supreme Court held that the people who are starving because of their inability to purchase food grains (viz. aged, infirm, disabled, destitute men/women, pregnant and lactating women and destitute children) ought to be provided the same free of cost by the States out of surplus stock lying with the States. ARTICLE 22: Safeguards Against Arbitrary Arrest and Detention Article 22 prescribes the minimum procedural requirements that must be included in any law enacted by the legislature in accordance with which a person may be deprived of his life and personal liberty. Thus, Art. 21 has to be read as supplemented by Art. 22. Art. 22 is not a complete code, and a law relating to preventive detention must satisfy requirement of Articles 14, 19 and 21, thus procedure prescribed under the preventive detention law must be reasonable, just and fair.",

    "content": "(I) and (2) - guarantees four rights to the persons (citizens and non-citizens) who are arrested under an ordinary law: Constitution/Constitutional Law 49 (a) the right to be informed ‘as soon as may be’ of ground of arrest, (b) the right to consult and to be represented by a lawyer of his own choice, (c) the right to be produced before a Magistrate within 24 hours, and (d) no detention beyond 24 hours except by the order of Magistrate. In Joginder Kumar v State o f U.P. (1994) 4 SCC 260, the Supreme Court has laid down guidelines governing arrest of a person during the investigation. The court laid down the following guidelines: (0 An arrested person being held in custody is entitled to have pne^ friend, relative or other person who is known to him or likely to take an interest in his welfare told as far as is practicable that he has been arrested and where he is being detained. (ii) Police Officer shall inform the arrested person, when he is brought to police station, of this right. (iii) An entry shall be required to be made in the police diary as to who Was informed of the arrest. In D. K. Bastt v State ofW .B. (AIR 1997 SC 610), the Supreme Court took serious note of custodial violence and death in police lock-up. It laid down various guidelines to be followed in all cases of arrest or detention. I : Clause (3) - provides two exceptions to rule contained in clause (1) and (2). It says that rights under clause (1) and (2) are not available to (a) an enemy alien, and, (b) a person detained under a Preventive Detention law. Preventive Detention Clause^ (4) to (7) of Art. 22 provides the procedure which is to be followed if a person is arrested under the law of Preventive Detention. Preventive Detention means ‘detention of a person without trial’. There is no authoritative definition of the term “preventive detention” in Indian law. While the object of the punitive detention is to punish a man for having done something, the object of preventive detention is to intercept him before he does it and to prevent him from doing it. No offence is proved nor any charge is formulated. The sole justification of such detention is suspicion or reasonable probability of the detenu committing some act likely to cause harm to society or endanger the security of the Government, and not criminal conviction which can only be warranted by legal evidence. Various such laws have been enacted e.g. MISA (Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971); Prevention o f Black-marketing and Maintenance o f Supplies o f Essential Commodities Act; NSA (National Security Act); COFEPOSA, TADA, etc. *•> Constitutional Safeguards Against Preventive Detention Laws Such safeguards against Preventive Detention laws are necessary to mitigate their harshness, by placing fetters on legislative power conferred on the Legislature. It is fo r, this reason that Art. 22 has been given a place in the chapter on “guaranteed rights”. Clauses (4) to (7) provides the following safeguards: (a) Review by Advisory Board. 50 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations (b) Composition and procedure of Advisory Board. (c) Grounds of detention and representation. (a) Review by Advisory Board Clause (4) (prior to 44th Amendment)- No law providing for preventive detention shall authorize the detention of a person for a longer period than 3 months unless, (a) an advisory board consisting of who are, or have been, or are qualified to be appointed as Judges of a High Coiirt has reported before the expiration of said period of 3 months that there is in its opinion sufficient cause'for such detention, and (b) such person is detained in accordance with the provisions of any law made by parliament under (a) and (b) of Clause (7). 'Clause (4) (after 44th Amendment) - The Amendment reduced the period from 3 months to 2 months i.e. period for which a person may be detained without obtaining the opinion of Board. The Amendment made the Advisory Board an independent body i.e. free from executive control. The Amendment abolished the provision for preventive detention without reference to an Advisory Board as provided in Clause (7) (a). Clause (7): (a) Parliament may by law prescribe the circumstances under which a person may be detained for a period longer than 3 months, without obtaining the opinion o f an Advisory Board. (Sub-clause (a) now deleted), (b) Parliament may by law prescribe the maximum period for which a person may be detained under any law providing for preventive detention. (Note: 44th Amendment has not yet been brought into force.) If the Advisory Board reports that detention is not justified the Government is duty bound to revoke the detention order. If the Board reports that detention is justified, than only the detaining authorities determine the period of detention, however the Board cannot express any opinion as to how much longer than 3 months the detenu should be kept in detention. If the Board fails to submit report before expiration o f said 3 months, the detention would become illegal. (b) Composition and Procedure of Advisory Board The Constitution of the Advisory Board has to be in accordance with the recommendation of Chief Justice of the Appropriate High Court. The chairman of the Board has to be a serving judge of High Court and other members have to be serving or retired judges of High Court. (c) Grounds of Detention and Representation Clause (5) - gives two rights to the detenu: (a) the authority making the order of detention must “as soon as may be” communicate to the person detained the grounds of his arrest i.e. the grounds which led to subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority, (b) to give the detenu “the earliest opportunity” of making a representation against the order of detention i.e. to be furnished with sufficient particulars to enable him to make a representation.

    "content": "22 (5) cast a duty on detaining authority to inform the detenu while serving the order of detention that he has a right to make representation against the order o f detention and also a right to be heard by the Advisory Board. It is to be noted that the consideration Constitution/Constitutional Law 51 of representation by detaining authority is entirely independent o f any action Ijy Advisory Board including the consideration of representation by the Board (Jaynarain Sukul v State ofW .B. AIR 1979 SC 675). The National Security Act provides that the detenu will be conveyed the grounds of the detention within 5 days and in exceptional cases within 10 days o f his detention. If there are exceptional circumstances, the detaining authority is to record its reasons in Writing. It is important to note that the grounds o f detention must be existent at the time of making the order. Subjective satisfaction of detaining authority can be challenged on the following grounds, namely, mala fid e or vagueness, and irrelevant or non-existent grounds or mechanical application of mind of detaining authority. Exception to Clause (5): Clause (6) provides that the authority to the detenu may Hot furnish disclosure of facts which are considered to be against public interest. In A.K. Roy v UOI (AIR 1982 SC 710), popularly known as the “NSA (National Security Act) Case”, the Supreme Court by 4-1 majority upheld the constitutional validity of the NSA. Held that the right of legal representation before the Board is not permissible [as contemplated by exceptions to Art. 22(1) and (2)]. Art. 22(5) gives a right to make a representation against the detention order, but that right does not carry with it the said right. The detaining authority also does not have such right. However, even in the face of constitutional and statutory denial of legal representation to a detenu, he is entitled to a common law right of representation through a ‘friend’ (but that ‘friend’ should not be a lawyer, law professor, etc.). Also held that a detenu has no right to cross-examine, but has right to present his own evidence in rebuttal of the allegations made against hiin. The court reasoned that firstly the question before the Board is not whether the detenu is guilty o f any charge but whether there is sufficient cause for his detention and, secondly, the witnesses would be most reluctant to testily and often it may harm public interest to disclose their identity [Art. 22(6)]. It also laid down that the detenu must be detained in a place where he habitually resides, unless exceptional circumstances require detention at other place. In Attorney General o f India v Amrit Lai, (1994) 5 SCC 54, a 9-judge Constitution Bench of Supreme Court held that during the period o f emergency the President is empowered to suspend fundamental rights of people and a detenu has no locus standi to question the reasons or grounds of his detention. The court upheld Sec. 12-A of COFEPOSA which had done away with the requirements of supply of grounds o f detention and the consultation with Advisory Board during the emergency. ARTICLES 2 3 -2 4 : Right Against Exploitation Article 23 prohibits “traffic in human beings and begar and other forced labour”. Traffic in human beings — women, children, etc. - and forced labour militate against human dignity. Under the old zamindari system, the tenants were sometimes jerced to render free service to their landlords. This was called begar. It has been held that even If some remuneration is paid, the labour may be a forced one (P U pR v UOI AIR 1982 SC 1473). Devadasis are also covered under the term “traffic in human beings”. Children of the prostitutes have a right to equality of opportunity, dignity, care, protection and rehabilitation so as to be part of the mainstream o f social life (Gaurav Jain v UO/ AIR 52 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations 1997 SC 3021). It may be noted that Art. 23 does not prohibit the State from imposin,, compulsory service for public purposes e.g. social or military service. In State o f Guja/-ai v H on’ble ffigh Court o f Gujarat (1998) 7 SCC 392, held that exaction of hard labour fr0tt1 convicted prisoners is not forced labour. Article'24 prohibits “employing children below age of 14 in any hazardous employment” This is in keeping with the human rights concepts and United Nations norms. In M.c, Mehta v State ofT.N. (AIR 1997 SC 609), held that children below the age of 14 years cannot be employed in any hazardous industry, mines or other works and has laid down exhaustive guidelines how the State authorities should protect economic, social and humanitarian rights of m|Ilions of working children. In Bandhua Mukti Morcha v Union o f India (AIR 1997 SC 2218), the court observed: “The basic cause for child labour being poverty, instead of its total abolition which will have adverse effect, it should be banned progressively in a planned manner starting from the most hazardous and intolerable activities like slavery, bonded labour, trafficking, prostitution, pornography and dangerous forms of labour, etc.” ARTICLES 25-28: Right to Freedom of Religion Articles 25 and 26 embody the principles of religious tolerance that has been the characteristic feature of Indian civilization from the start of history. Besides they serve to emphasize the secular nature of Indian democracy i.e. equal respect tp all religions. A secular State does not mean an irreligious State, it only means that in matters of religion it is ‘neutral’, the State can have no religion of its own, and the State protects all religions but interferes with none. In a secular State, the State is only concerned with the relation between man and man, it is not concerned with the relation o f man with God. It is left to the individual’s conscience.",

In a secular State, the State is only concerned with  the relation between man and man, it is not concerned with the relation o f man with God. It is left to the individual’s conscience. The word ‘secularism’, however, is vague as it might be used as an instrument of unrestrained communalism or bigotry or anti-religionism. In Santosh Kumar v Secy., Ministry o f Human Resources Development, AIR 1995 SC 293, the court said that “State tolerance of religion, does not make it either a religious or a theocratic State.” Secularism is neither ante-God nor pro-God, as it treats alike the devout, antagonistic and the atheist. In S.R. Bommai v Union o f India J.T. 1994 (2) SC 215, the court held that ‘secularism’ is a basic feature of the Constitution and any State Government which acts against that ideal can be dismissed by the President. In matters of State, religion has no place. No political party can simultaneously be a religious party, and, politics and religion cannot be mixed. In M. Ismail Faruqui v Union o f India (“Ayodhya Case”) (AIR 1995 SC 605), the court observed: “The concept of secularism is one facet o f the right to equality woven as the central golden thread in the fabric depicting the pattern of the scheme in Constitution. Moreover, any step taken to arrest escalation o f communal tension and to achieve communal accord and harmony can, by no stretch of argumentation, be termed non­ secular or anti-secular. Secularism is a creed of the Indian people embedded in the ethos”. Art. 2 5 : Freedom o f Conscience an d Free P rofession, P ra c tic e and Propagation o f Religion (1) Subject to “public order, morality and health and to the other provisions o f Part III of Constitution”, all persons are equally entitled to freedom o f conscience and the right freely to profess, practice and propagate religion. Constitution/Conslitutional Law 53 (2) Nothing in this Article shall affect the operation o f any existing law or prevent the State from making any law - (a) regulating or restricting any economic, financial, political, or other secular activity which may be associated with religious practice; (b) providing for social welfare and reform or the throwing open of Hindu religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections o f Hindus. Explanation I - The wearing and carrying of Kirpans shall be deemed to be included in the profession of Sikh religion. Explanation II - The expression “Hindu” includes Jain, Sikhs and Buddhists. Religion is essentially a matter o f personal faith and belief. Freedom o f conscience connotes a person’s right to entertain beliefs and doctrines concerning matters which are regarded by him to be conducive to his spiritual well being. To 1profess’ a religion means to declare freely and openly one’s faith and belief by practical expression in any manner one likes. To ‘practice’ religion is to perform the prescribed religious duties, rites and rituals. To ‘propagate’ means to spread and publicize his religious views for the edification of others. The right to propagate one’s religion does not give a right to convert another person to one’s own religion, as that would impinge on the “freedom o f conscience” guaranteed to all persons (Stainlaus v State o f M.P. AIR 1977 SC 908). In Bijoe Emmanuel v State o f Kerala (1986) 3 SCC 615 (“National Apthem Case”), fhree children belonging to the ‘Jehovah’s witnesses’ of Christian community were expelled from school for refusing to sing National Anthem. The Kerala High Court held that it was their Fundamental Duty under the Constitution to sing the National Anthem. The Supreme Court, however, held that there is no legal obligation for a citizen to sing national anthem. The freedom of speech and expression under Art. 19(l)(a) also includes the freedom o f silence'. The court said that by standing up while the anthem was being sung, the children had shown proper respect to national anthem and had thus not violated the fundamental duty (Art. 51 A). It relied heavily on the decisions of Australian and American Supreme Courts (Minersville School v Gobitis and West Virginia Board o f Education v Barnette). The Court observed: Art. 25 is an Article of faith in the Constitution, incorporated in recognition of the principle that the real test of a true democracy is the ability o f even an insignificant minority to find its identity under Constitution. The question is not whether a particular religious belief or practice appeals to our reason or sentiment, but whether the belief is genuinely and conscientiously held as part o f the profession or practice o f religion. Thus, held that no person can be compelled to sing the national anthem “if he has genuine conscientious religious objection”. Restrictions on Freedom of Religion Art. 25: Clause(l) - In the name of religion, no act can be done against public order, morality and health of the public. For example, in the name o f religion ‘untouchability or traffic in human beings’ e.g. system of devadasis cannot be tolerated. The freedom o f religion is also subject to the “other provisions of this Part” e.g., right to freedom o f speech and expression, freedom of assembly and association, etc. 54 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations Clause (2)(a) - The freedom to practice extends only to those activities which are the ‘essence of religion’ [State ofW.B. v Ashutosh Lahiri (1995) 1 SCC 189]. It does not cover secular, political or commercial activities associated with religious practice.",

    "content": "does not cover  secular, political or commercial activities associated with religious practice. In Acharya Jagdishwaranand v Commissioner o f Police, Calcutta (‘Anand Margj' Case) (1984) 4 SCC 522, held that the ‘Tandava dance’ in procession or at public places by Ananda Margis carrying lethal weapons and human skulls was not an ‘essential1 religious rite and hence the order prohibiting such procession was not violative of the right of petitioners under Articles 25 and 26. In Commr. o f Police v Acharya Jagadishwarananda (2004) 12 SCC 809, the Apex Court (majority opinion) held that the performance of Tandava dance in public procession by Ananda Margis is not an essential or integral part of their religion and, thus, not a matter of religion within the meaning of Arts. 25 and 26. The test to determine whether a part or practice is essential to a religion is to find out whether nature of the religion will be changed without that part or practice, Clause (2)(b) - Under this clause, State can eradicate social practices (viz. bigamy and polygamy under Hindu law) and dogmas which stand in the path of the country’s onward progress. Such laws do not affect the essence of any religion. This sub-clause ensures an individual’s legal right to enter into a temple unobstructed irrespective of his caste, untouchability, social inequality, etc. Art. 26: Freedom to M anage Religious Affairs Subject to public order, morality and health, every religious denomination or any section thereof shall have the right: (a) to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes, (b) to manage its own affairs in matters of religion, (c) to own and acquire movable and immovable property, and, (d) to administer such property in accordance with law. While, right guaranteed by Art. 25 is an individual right, the right guaranteed by Art. 26 is the right of an ‘organized body’. The word ‘religious denomination’ in Art. 26 must satisfy three conditions: (1) It must be a collection of individual who have a system of beliefs which they regard as conducive to their spiritual well being i.e. a common faith. (2) It must have a common organization. (3) It must be designated by a distinctive name. Thus, in a large sense, ‘Hinduism’, ‘Muslims’, ‘Christians’ are such denominations. In limited sense, the various philosophers governing the Hindu society such as Advaitas, Saivites, etc. are also denominations. Among Mohammedans, Hanafi, Shia or Chisti sects are separate denominations. Also, maths or the spiritual fraternity (a section of denomination) represented by it comes within this Article (LT Swamiar's case). Under Art. 26 (b), the court has a right to determine whether a particular rite or ceremony is regarded as essential by the tenets of a particular religion. The right is also subject to the regulatory powers of State under Art. 25 (2) (b) (Saifuddin Saheb v State of Bombay AIR 1962 SC 853). Constitution/Constitutional Law 55 The right of a religious denomination to manage its property (Cls. (c) and (d) of Art. 26) has been placed on a different footing from the right to manage its own affairs in matters of religion. The latter is a fundamental right which can’t be taken away except on grounds mentioned in Art. 25, the former can be regulated by laws which the Legislature can validly impose e.g. general property law. Also, Art. 26(c) is to be read subject to State’s power to acquire private property under Art. 31. Thus, property of a denomination can be acquired by State. In Rati Lai v State o f Bombay (AIR 1954 SC 388) and Commr. HRE v L.T. Swamiar (AIR 1954 SC 282), held that the law must leave the right of administration of property to religious denomination itself subject to such regulation as to improve the administration. In S.R Mittal v Union of India (AIR 1983 SC 1), the Aurobindo Society and an international cultural township- Auroville were held not to be religious institutions or denomination. The teachings of Sri Aurobindo only represented his philosophy and not a religion. In Bramchari Sidheswar Shai v State of W.B. (1995) 4 SCC 646 (“.Ramakrishna Mission case”), held that the followers of Ramakrishna, who are collection of individuals, and who adhere to a system of beliefs, and who’ve an organization of definite name 'Ramakrishna Math or Mission’ can be regarded as a religious denomination within Hindu religion. In M. Ismail Faruqui v Union o f India (“Ayodhya Case”) the court held that the right to practice, profess and propagate religion under Art. 25 does not necessarily include the right to acquire or own or possess property. While offer of prayer or worship is a religious practice, its offering at every location where such prayers can be offered would not be an essential or integral part of such religious practices unless the place has a particular significance for that religion so as to form an essential or integral part thereof. In ERJ Swaml v State ofT.N. (AIR 1972 SC 1586), the T.N. Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Act, 1970 was questioned on the ground that it violated Articles 25 and 26 (i.e. by purporting to introduce social reforms in the matter of appointment of Archakas and pujaris, the State has really interfered with the religious faith and practices of saivite and vaishnavite temples). Held that Archaka is not regarded as a spiritual head, but rather a ‘servant’ subject to the disciplinary power of the trustee. He owes his appointment to a secular authority. The purposes of the Act are essentially secular, and not intended to effect a change in the rituals and ceremonies followed in temples. Art. 27: Freedom Not to Pay Taxes for Religious Promotion Art. 27 says that no person shall be compelled to pay any taxes for expenses on promotion or maintenance of any particular religion i.e. there could be no objection if the taxes were used for the promotion of all religions.

Art. 27: Freedom Not to Pay Taxes for Religious Promotion Art. 27 says that no person shall be compelled to pay any taxes for expenses on  promotion or maintenance of any particular religion i.e. there could be no objection if the taxes were used for the promotion of all religions. Art. 28: Freedom Not to Attend Religious Instructions Art. 28 prohibits religious instructions in educational institution wholly maintained by the State. In case of other institutions recognized and aided by the State, there will be freedom for every person not to participate in religious instruction or worship. In Aruna Roy v Union o f India (2002) 7 SCC 368 (“The Textbook Case”) (“New Education Policy Case”), the Supreme Court upheld the validity of National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCFSE) rejecting the petitioner’s contention that it was an attempt to “saffronise” education by the BJP led N.D.A. Government. It held that an 56 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations emphasis in, about requirement of “education about religions”, their basics, the values inherent therein and also comparative study of the philosophy of all religions is neither violative of Art. 28 nor offends against secularism. The court observed: The entire emphasis in Art. 28 is against imparting ‘religj0lls instructions’ (teaching rituals, customs, etc.). There is no prohibition for having study 0f religious philosophy and culture, particularly for having value-based social life in a society which is degenerating for power, post or property. Secularism is the basic structure o f the Constitution. “Secularism” has a positive meaning that is developing understanding and respect towards different religions (“religious pluralism”). The essence of secularism is non-discrimination of people by the State on the basis of religious differences. Art. 28 ( 1) does not prohibit introduction of study of religions in the State educational institutions including those wholly or partially aided by the State. After the National Education Policy of 1986, a shift by the impugned National Education Policy, 2002 towards teaching of religions in the schools to educate children to understand common factors in all religions, is not a non-secular step. ARTICLES 29-30: Rights to Minorities (Cultural and Educational Rights) The word “minority” is not defined in the Constitution. Whether a section of citizens constitutes a “minority” for the purpose of Arts. 29 and 30 in a State must be determined by reference to the entire population of the State. It refers to any community which is numerically less than 50% of the entire population of State. A minority could not be determined in relation to entire population of the country. In Frank Anthony Public School Employees Association v UOI (AIR 1987 SC 311) the Supreme Court observed: “The idea of giving special rights to minorities is not to have a kind of a privileged or pampered section of the population but to give them a sense of security and feeling of confidence”. In Bal Patil v Union o f India (AIR 2005 SC 3172), the Apex Court examined the scope and definition of the term “Minorities”. It observed that though not specifically defined, “minority” as understood from the constitutional scheme signifies an identifiable group of people or community who were seen as deserving protection from a likely deprivation of their religious, cultural and educational rights by other communities who happened to be in a majority and likely to gain power in a democratic form of government based on election. The constitutional ideal, which can be gathered from the group of articles in the Constitution under the chapters of fundamental rights and fundamental duties, is to create social conditions where there remains no necessity to shield or protect rights of a minority or majority. Art. 29: Protection of Interest of Minorities (1) Any section o f the citizens residing in the territory o f India or any part thereof having a distinct language, script or culture o f his own shall have the right to conserve the same. (2) No citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the State or receiving aid out o f State funds on grounds only o f religion, race, caste, language or any o f them. Constitution/Constitutional Law 57 A minority community can effectively conserve its language, script or culture by and through educational institutions, as what is conferred by Art. 29(1). Art. 29(2) is quite general and applies to all citizens, whether they belong to majority or minority groups. Therefore, a school run by minority, if it is aided by State funds, cannot refuse admission to boys of other communities. Also, the State cannot direct such school to restrict admissions to their own community. However, nothing in Art. 29(2) shall prevent the State from making reservations for backward classes under Art. 15. Art. 30: Right o f Minorities to Establish and Adm inister Educational Institutions (1) All minorities, whether based on religion or language, shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions o f their choice. (2) The State shall not, in granting aid to educational institutions, discriminate against any educational institution on the ground that it is under the management o f a minority. The right is conferred by this clause on two types of minorities: religious and linguistic. The word “establish” indicates the right to bring into existence, while the right to “administer■” means the right to effectively manage and conduct the affairs of institution. The ‘right to administer’ means the right to effectively manage and conduct the affairs of institution. The right to administer is said to consist of four principal matters: right to choose its managing or governing body, right to choose its teachers who have compatibility with the aims and aspirations of institution, right to admit students of their choice subject to reasonable regulations about academic qualifications, and, right to use its properties and assets for benefit of institution (St.",

The  right to administer is said to consist of four principal matters: right to choose its managing  or governing body, right to choose its teachers who have compatibility with the aims and  aspirations of institution, right to admit students of their choice subject to reasonable  regulations about academic qualifications, and, right to use its properties and assets for  benefit of institution (St. Xaviers College v State o f Gujarat AIR 1971 SC 1389). However, right to administer is not an absolute right. The right to administer is not the right to maladminister (Re Kerala Education Bill case). The regulatory measures aimed at making minority institutions effective instruments for imparting education, without nullifying management’s right in substantial measures, are permissible (Frank Anthony Public School Employees Association case). The following regulatory measures are held to be permissible: measures which regulate the educational standards, the course of study, the qualifications and appointment of teachers, the conditions of the employment of employees, safeguards which must be observed before removal of employees, the academic qualifications for admission of students, health and hygiene of students, facilities for libraries and labs, etc. (All Saints High School v State o f A.P. AIR 1980 SC 1042). A minority institution cannot prescribe qualifications for admission of students, but can prescribe procedure for admission of students. In St. Stephen s College v University o f Delhi ((AIR 1992 SC 1630), held that the “interview” is an integral part of the college’s administration. The University cannot direct the college to dispense with its admission programme in the absence of proof of maladministration of the college. Also, held that minority aided institutions may reserve up to 50% seats for their community candidates and aw entitled to prefer them in admissions as it is necessary to maintain the minority character of institutions. In St. Xavier College case, held that minority institutions have no fundamental right to affiliation, but to deny affiliation or recognition except upon certain terms and conditions 58 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations amount to the surrender of their right to administer under Art. 30( 1). When a minor- institution applies to a university for affiliation, it expresses its choice to participate'^ the system of general education. Affiliation is for regulating the educational character an*1 content of minority institutions. Relationship between Art. 29(1)/ (2) and Art. 30(1) In St. Xavier College case, held that Art. 30(1) covers institutions imparting genera! secular education. Articles 29 and 30 create two separate rights though it is possible ti,al the rights might meet in a given case. The court pointed out the following distinctions between two Articles: (i) Art. 29(1) confers right on any section of citizens, thus including majority; An 30(1) confers right only on religious or linguistic minorities. (ii) Art. 29(1) is concerned with only three subjects viz. language, script or culture- Art. 30(1) deals with minorities based on language or religion. (iii) Art. 29(1) is concerned with right to conserve language, etc.; Art. 30(1) deals with right to administer educational institutions. (iv) Art. 29(1) does not deal with education as such; Art. 30(1) dqals only with establishment and administration of educational institutions. Thus, conservation of language, script or culture under Art. 29(1) may be by means wholly unconnected with the educational institutions and similarly, establishment and administration of educational institutions under Art. 30(1) may be unconnected with any motive to conserve language, script or culture. In St. Stephen’s College case, the court observed: “It is necessary to mediate between Art. 29(2) and Art. 30(1), between letter and spirit of these Articles, between traditions of past and the convenience of the person, between society’s need for stability and its need for change.” Recent Case Law In T.M.A. Pai Foundation v State o f Karnataka (2002) 8 SCC 481, an II -Judge Constitution Bench (6:5 majority) held that minority communities have an untrammelled right to establish and administer unaided educational institutions, while the institutions which receive State aid could be subject to Government rules and regulations. In respect of ‘unaided’ institutions, the only regulation a State Government or University can make is regarding the qualifications and minimum conditions of eligibility in the interest of academic standards. The State can make no laws regarding admissions or fees in such institutions. A minority institution does not cease to be so, the moment grant-in-aid is received. An aided institution will be entitled to have the right of admission of students belonging to the minority group. At the same time, it would be required to admit a reasonable extent of non-minority students, so that the rights under Art. 30 (I) are not substantially impaired and further, citizen’s rights under Art. 29 (2) are not infringed. The Apex Court also ruled that the basic ratio in the St. Stephen’s case (reservation of 50 per cent of the seats in aided institutions to the management’s discretion) is correct, however, rigid percentage cannot be stipulated. The Court empowered States to fix quotas for minority students taking into account the type of institution, population and educational needs of the minorities. The Court reiterated that the constitutional rights conferred on Constitution/Constitutional Law 59 minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice is not absolute or above other laws. The court also held as “unconstitutional” the Scheme framed by the Apex Court in the Unnikrishnan s case viz. fixing ‘free’ and ‘payment’ seats. The court lifted the regulation on fees to be charged by unaided institutions with the proviso that there would not be “profiteering”. Reasonable surplus to meet the cost of expansion and augmentation of facilities does not, however, amount to profiteering.",

    "content": "five-judge Bench of the Supreme Court in Islamic Academy o f Education v State o f Karnataka (2003) 6 SCC 697, clarifying the doubts read in T.M.A. Pai Foundation case (majority decision), has directed the constitution of a separate committee in each State, to be headed by a retired judge of the High Court, to approve the fee structure of the institutions conducting medical and engineering courses and to ensure that the tests conducted for admission by these institutions were fair and transparent. In fixing percentage of quota for students to be admitted by the Management of unaided minority professional colleges, the State would keep in mind, apart from local needs, the paramount interest/ need of that community in the State. In Modern School v UOI (AIR 2004 SC 2236), it was held that in determination of the fee structure, unaided educational institutions exercise a great autonomy as they are entitled to generate a reasonable surplus for development of education and expansion of the institution itself. What is prohibited is commercialization of education/profiteering and the diversion of the profit/surplus for any other use or purposes and the use thereof for personal gains or for other business or enterprise. Hence a balance has to be struck between autonomy of such institutions and measures to be taken to prevent commercialization of education. In PA. Inamdar v State o f Maharashtra (2005) 6 SCC 537, the Apex Court clarified some issues raised in T.M.A. Pai case (2002) 8 SCC 481 and Islamic Academy case (2003) 6 SCC 697, relating to rights of professional unaided (minority and non-minority) educational institutions. It held: Each minority institution is entitled to have its own fee structure subject to the condition that there can be no profiteering and capitation fees cannot be charged. To check profiteering and capitation fees, the method of admission has to be regulated so that admissions are based on merit. Hence it is permissible to regulate admission and fee structure for achieving the same. Minority institutions stand on a better footing than non-minority institutions. State legislation cannot favour non-minority institutions over minority institutions. The difference arises because of Art. 30, the protection whereunder is available to minority institutions only. The unaided professional institutions will have full autonomy in their administration, but the principle of merit cannot be sacrificed, as excellence in professions is in the national interest. The court, however, clarified that neither can the policy of reservation be enforced by the State nor can any quota or percentage of admissions be carved out to be appropriated by the State in a minority or non-minority unaided educational institution. The State cannot insist on private educational institutions which receive no aid from the State to implement the State’s policy on reservation for granting admission on lesser percentage of marks i.e. on any criterion except merit. There is nothing in T.M.A. Pai case (2002) 8 SCC 481 which permits the same. Such State imposition would constitute a serious encroachment on the right and autonomy of private professional institutions and also cannot be held to be a 60 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations regulatory measure in the interest of the minority within the meaning of Art. 30(1) 0r reasonable restriction within the meaning of Art. 19(6) of the Constitution. In Naresh Agarwal v Bharat (2006), the petitioners (Hindu Students) were denied admissions to Post Graduate Medical Courses in Aligarh Muslim University (A.M.U.) f0r the 2005-06 Session. They challenged the validity of rule which declared the A.M.U a minority institution and allowed 50 per cent reservation to Muslim students. The Allahabad High Court held that A.M.U. was not a minority institution. The court struck down the amendment made to this effect in the statute of A.M.U. for reservation to Muslim Students. The court followed the Aziz Basha v UOI case wherein the Supreme Court had held that Aligarh University was established by an Act of Parliament, not by any Muslim ARTICLE 31: Right to Property and Saving of Certain Laws The ‘Right to Property’ has proved to be the most complicated and controversial. The consensus was embodied in Art. 19 (0 and Art. 31. But, the 44th Amendment, 1978 repealed these Articles completely with effect from 20 June 1979. Instead, in Part XII of the Constitution, a new Chapter IV and a new Art. 300-A was added to provide that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law. Thus, the “right to property” ceases to be a fundamental right but still remains a legal right. Art. 300-A gives protection against executive action but not against legislative action. Notwithstanding the repeal of Art. 31, Art. 31 -A (added by the 1st Amendment, 1951 and amended by the 4th, 17th, and 44th Amendment), Art. 31-B (added by the 1st Amendment, 1951) and Art. 31-C (added by the 25th Amendment, 1971 and amended by 42nd and 44th Amendments) remain part of the Fundamental Rights. Art. 31-A saves certain laws providing for acquisition of estates etc. from being questioned on grounds of inconsistency with Arts. 14 and 19. Art. 31-B saves certain Acts and Regulations listed in the 9th Schedule from being challenged on the ground of inconsistency with any of the Fundamental Rights. Art. 31-C saves certain laws giving effect to Directive Principles from being questioned and invalidated on grounds of inconsistency with Arts. 14 and 19. ARTICLES 32-35: Right to Constitutional Remedies See Art. 32 under the ‘Supreme Court and High Courts’. Article 33 empowers Parliament to modify the application of Fundamental Rights to the Armed Forces or forces charged with maintenance of public order, etc. in the interest of discharge of duties and maintenance of discipline. Though the appellate jurisdiction of courts is excluded in cases of court martial, the writ jurisdiction remains (unless taken away by law under Art. 33). Under Art. 34, Parliament may by law indemnify any person for anything done in contravention of fundamental rights for maintenance of order during the operation of martial law. Art.",

Though the appellate jurisdiction  of courts is excluded in cases of court martial, the writ jurisdiction remains (unless taken  away by law under Art. 33). Under Art. 34, Parliament may by law indemnify any person for anything done in  contravention of fundamental rights for maintenance of order during the operation of  martial law. Art. 35 lays down that the power to make laws to give effect to certain specified fundamental rights shall vest only in the Parliament and not in State Legislatures. Constitution/Constitutional Law 61 [B] Directive Principles of State Policy The Directive Principles of State Policy contained in Part IV of the Constitution (Arts. 36- 51) set out the aims and objectives to be taken up by the States in the governance of the country. The idea of ‘welfare State’ envisaged by our Constitution can only be achieved if the States endeavour to implement them with a high sense of moral duty. The real importance of Directive Principles is that they contain positive obligation of State towards its citizens. They are the ideals which the Union and State Governments must keep in mind while they formulate or pass a law. The Directive Principles constitute a very comprehensive political, social and economic programme for a modem democratic State. The main object in enacting them appear to have been to set standards of achievements before the legislature and the executive, the local and other authorities, by which their success or failure can be judged. Sanctions behind the Directive Principles are based on sound constitutional and moral obligations. Constitutional obligations are secured by having Directive Principles as an integral part of Constitution. The biggest moral force is public opinion which can enforce the Directive Principles and ensure government’s accountability at the time of elections. Thus, sanctions behind Directive Principles are political. Art. 37 of the Constitution lays down that it shall be the duty of State to apply these Directives in making laws. Articles 355 and 365 of the Constitution can be applied for enforcing implementation of Directive Principles. Classification of the Directive Principles (a) Social and Economic Charter (1) Social order based on justice - Art. 38(1) provides that the State shall strive to promote the welfare of people by securing and protecting a social order in which justice - social, economic and political - shall inform all the institutions of national life. Further, the State shall strive to minimize inequalities. (2) Economic justice - Art. 39 specifically requires the State to direct its policy towards securing the following principles: (a) Equal right of men and women to adequate means of livelihood. (b) Distribution of ownership and control of material resources of the community to the common good. (c) To ensure that the economic system should not result in concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment. (d) Equal pay for equal work for both men and women. (e) To protect health and strength of workers and tender age of children and to ensure that they are not forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their age or growth. (0 That children are given opportunities and facilities to develop in a healthy manner and in condition of freedom and dignity and that childhood and youth are protected against exploitation and against moral and material abandonment. 62 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations Articles 38 and 39 embody the principle of ‘distributive justice' which connotes the removal of economic inequalities rectifying the injustice resulting from transactions between unequals in society. In Randhir Singh v Union o f India (AIR 1982 SC 879), held that the principles of ‘equal pay for equal work’ (Art. 39(d)) though not a fundamental right is certainly a constitutional goal and, therefore, capable of enforcement through constitutional remedies under Art. 32. The right of tribals to social and economic empowerment is a fundamental right guaranteed under Art. 21 and Arts. 38,39 and 46 (Sama/Jia v State o f A.P. AIR 1997 SC 3297). (b) Social Security Charter (1) Participation o f workers in management o f industries - Art. 43-A. (2) Right to work, education and public assistance in cases o f unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement - Art. 41. (3) Just and human conditions o f work - Art. 42. (4) Living wage for workers - Art. 43‘. 'The concept of living wage includes in addition to the bare necessities of life (food, shelter and clothing), provisions for education of children and insurance, etc. (5) Free and compulsory education for children until they complete the age of 14 years - Art. 45. However, after the 86th Constitution Amendment Act, 2002, Art. 45 reads: \"The State shall endeavour to provide early childhood care and education to children below the age o f 6 years.” (6) Duty to raise the standard o f living and improvement o f health -- Art. 47. It includes, in particular, the prohibition of liquor. (7) Promotion o f educational and economic interest o f weaker sections - Art. 46. (8) Equal justice and free legal aid to economically backward classes - Art. 39- A. In Centre o f Legal Research v State o f Kerala (AIR 1986 SC 1322), it has been held that in order to achieve the objectives in Art. 39-A, the State must encourage and support the participation of voluntary organizations in operating the legal aid programme. In State of Maharashtra v Manubhai Pragaji Vashi (1995) 5 SCC 730, held that under Art. 21 read with Art. 39-A casts on the State a duty to afford grants-in-aid to recognized private law colleges similar to other faculties e.g. Art, Science, etc. ‘Free legal aid’ and ‘speedy trial’ guaranteed under Art. 21 read with Art. 39-A are fundamental rights. (c) Community Welfare Charter (1) Uniform Civil Code - Art. 44.",

(c) Community Welfare Charter (1) Uniform Civil Code -  Art. 44. While the State has tried to reform and codify the personal law of the Hindus (which is also applicable to Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists), no attempt has been made to bring the Muslims, Christians and Parsees under the purview of a common civil code.

Constitution/Constitutional Law 63 (5) Separation o f judiciary from executive - Art. 50. (6) Promotion o f international peace and security - Art. 51. Pursuant to the direction enshrined in Art. 51, Parliament passed the Protection o f Human Rights Act, 1993 which provides for the setting of a National Human Rights Commission and Human Rights Courts to meet the growing concern for human rights in the country and abroad. (7) Organization o f village panchayats - Art. 40. The object of this provision is to introduce democracy at the grass roots. Im plem entation and Utility of Directives Opinion differs on how far the Directives have been implemented in actual practice. In keeping with Directives, the main object of 5-year plans is to achieve a balanced economic development and to raise living standard of masses. As for the implementation of specific Directives, good progress has been made: (0 Land reforms, abolition of intermediaries and zamindari system. (ii) Organization of village panchayats; promotion of cottage industries; welfare of SC, ST, etc. (iii) Compulsory primary education achieved in most States. (iv) Minimum wages for workers; modernization of labour laws. (v) Hindu Marriage Act and Hindu Succession Act - for securing uniform civil code. The Directives are “moral precepts” for the authorities of State. They provide a middle way between individual liberty and public good. Dr. Ambedkar had said that these principles were not intended to be mere pious obligations; they are ‘instrument of instructions’ upon all future governments, irrespective of their party creeds. Directives have shaped the governmental policies and programmes. They are ‘fundamental in the governance of the country’ (Art. 37). Thus, they are not mere ‘moral precepts’, but are ‘positive mandates’. The courts are enforcing the Directives indirectly. In determining the Constitutional validity of legislation, they are given precedence over the Fundamental Rights. They are relevant to consider what are reasonable restrictions under Art. 19. In Sarla Mudgal v Union o f India (AIR 1995 SC 1531), the Supreme Court strongly recommended the need for a uniform civil code, declaring illegal the second marriage by a Hindu husband after conversion to Islam. The judges argued that religious practices, violative of human rights and dignity and sacerdotal suffocation of essentially civil and material freedoms, are not autonomy but oppression. The judges upheld the view that unified, progressive civil law would promote national unity and solidarity and safeguard the interests o f the weaker and oppressed sections. The court observed that Art. 44 sought to divest religion from social relations and personal laws. Marriage, succession and like matters of a secular character cannot be brought within the guarantees under Articles 25 and 26 of Constitution. The legislature is within its rights to supersede or supplement this personal law by a uniform civil code. In John Vallamatton v UOI (AIR 2003 SC 2902), the Supreme Court reiterated that a ‘Common Civil Code’ (Art. 44) would enhance the cause of national integration by removing the contradictions based on ideologies. 64 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations Relation between Directive Principles and Fundam ental Rights The Directive Principles differs from Fundamental Rights in certain respects: (1) The Directives are non-justiciable i.e. can’t be enforced by the courts; they are declaratory. While Fundamental Rights are justiciable i.e. can be enforced b courts; they are mandatory. (2) The Directives are instrument of instructions to the Government, they contain positive commands to the State to promote a social and welfare State. The Fundamental Rights are limitations upon the State actions, they contain negate injunctions to the State not to do various things. (3) Unlike Fundamental Rights, the Directives are required to be implemented by legislation. (4) The courts cannot declare as void any law which is otherwise valid on the ground that it contravenes any of the Directives. On the other hand, the courts are bound to declare as void any law that is inconsistent with fundamental rights. The place the Directive Principles occupy in the Constitution vis-^-vis the Fundamental Rights has been a subject matter of controversy for a long time, which has been set at rest: (i) In State o f Madras v Champakam Doraitajan (AIR 1951 SC 228), held that the Directive Principles cannot override the Fundamental Rights. (ii) In Re Kerala Education Bill (AIR 1957 SC 956), the court observed that though the Directive Principles cannot override the Fundamental Rights, neveitheless, in determining the scope and ambit of Rights the court may not entirely ignore the Directives but should adopt the principles of harmonious construction and should attempt to give effect to both as much as possible. (iii) 25th Amendment, 1971 considerably enhanced the importance of Directives. Art. 31-C, added by it, provided that a law for implementing Directives contained in Art. 39 (b) and (c) could not be struck down on the ground that it contravened rights conferred by Articles 14 and 19. (iv) 42nd Amendment, 1976 widened the scope of Art. 31-C so as to cover all Directive Principles. Thus, it gave precedence to all the Directives over the Fundamental Rights - Arts. 14 and 19.",

    "content": "31-C, added by it, provided that a law for implementing Directives  contained in Art. 39 (b) and (c) could not be struck down on the ground  that it contravened rights conferred by Articles 14 and 19. (iv) 42nd Amendment, 1976 widened the scope of Art. 31-C so as to cover all  Directive Principles. Thus, it gave precedence to all the Directives over the  Fundamental Rights -  Arts. 14 and 19. (v) In Keshavananda Bharati v Union o f India (AIR 1978 SC 1461), the court observed that the Fundamental Right: and Directive Principles are meant to supplement one another. It can well be said that the Directives prescribed the goal to be attained and Fundamental Rights lay down the means by which that goal is to be achieved. (vi) In Minerva Mills v Union o f India (AIR 1980 SC 1789), the court struck down Art. 31 -C as amended by 42nd amendment as unconstitutional on the ground that it destroys the “basic features” of the Constitution. The majority observed that the Constitution is founded on the bedrock of the balance between Part III and IV. To give absolute primacy to one over the other is Conslitution/Constitutional Law 65 to disturb the harmony of the Constitution which is the essential feature of the basic structure. j' (vii) In State ofT.N. v Abu Kavur Bai (AIR 1984 SC 626) a five-judge Bench held I that although the Directives are not enforceable yet the court should make a real attempt at harmonizing and reconciling the Directives and the Rights and any collision between the two should be avoided as far as possible. The reason why the founding fathers of our Constitution did not make these principles enforceable was, the court said, perhaps due to the vital consideration of giving the government sufficient latitude to implement these principles from time to time according to capacity, situation and circumstances that may arise. (viii) In Unni Krishnan v State o f A.P. (1993) 1 SCC 645, the court has reiterated the same principle that the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles are supplementary and complementary to each other and the provisions in Part 111 should be interpreted having regard to the preamble and Directive Principles. Conclusions - There is no conflict or disharmony between Directive Principles and Fundamental Rights, because they supplement each other in aiming at the same goal of bringing about a social revolution and establishment of a welfare State. As described by Granville Austin, the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles are the “Conscience o f our Constitution”. In State o f Gujarat v Mirzapur Moti Qureshi Kassab Jamet (AIR 2006 SC 212), it was held that when faced with the question of testing the constitutional validity of any statutory provision or an executive act, or for testing the reasonableness of any restriction cast by law on the exercise of any fundamental right by vfay of regulation, control or prohibition, the Directive Principles of State Policy and Fundamental Duties as enshrined in Art. 51-A plays a significant role. [C] FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES Fundamental Duties are incorporated in Part IV-A, which consists of only one Art. 5 1-A, added by 42nd Amendment, 1976. It says that it shall be the duty of every citizen of India (there are eleven such duties, after the 86th Constitution Amendment Act, 2002): (a) to abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the National Flag and National Anthem, (b) to cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our national struggle for freedom, (c) to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and .integrity of India, (d) to defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so. (e) to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities; to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women, (f) to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture. 66 Law Guide for Competitive Examinations (g) to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wild life, and to have compassion for living creature, (h) to develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform, (i) to safeguard public property and to abjure violence, (j) to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievements, and Of) who is parent or guardian, to provide opportunities for education to his child or ward between the age of 6 and 14 years (inserted by the 86th Constitution Amendment Act, 2002). The new Chapter on Fundamental Duties is “the palm embodying noble ideals, rhythm, harmony with the impress of the hand of the Prime Minister”. Verma Committee on Fundamental Duties (1999) noted: “Essentially all that is contained in the Fundamental Duties is just a codification of tasks integral to the Indian way of life”. Significance o f Duties - Rights and Duties are correlative. Mahatma Gandhi defined right as “duty well performed”. The fundamental duties (‘code of conduct’) are intended to serve as a constant reminder to every citizen that while the Constitution specifically conferred on them certain fundamental rights, it also requires citizens to observe certain basic norms of democratic conduct and democratic behaviour. Fundamental duties are confined to “citizens”, unlike Fundamental rights like Art. 21 which extends to “all persons”. The fundamental duties seek to limit the operation of fundamental rights- a countervailing factor and a warning to reckless citizens against anti-social activities like destroying public property, burning national flag, and the like. It is significant to note that none of the Constitution of western countries specifically provides the duties and obligations of citizens. However, the Constitution of socialist countries lay great emphasis on the citizens’ duties. Enforcement o f Duties - The duties incorporated in the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment are statutory duties and shall be enforceable by law.",

However, the Constitution of socialist countries lay great emphasis  on the citizens’ duties. Enforcement o f Duties -  The duties incorporated in the Constitution by the 42nd  Amendment are statutory duties and shall be enforceable by law. Parliament, by law, will provide penalties to be imposed for failure to fulfill those duties and obligations. A court in determining the constitutional validity of any law seeking to give effect to duties, may consider law to be ‘reasonable’ in relation to Art. 14 or 19. In M.C. Mehta v Union o f India (1983) I SCC 471, held that under Art. 5I-A(g) it is the duty of the Central Government to introduce compulsory teaching of lessons at least for one hour in a week on protection and improvement of natural environment in all educational institutions. In AIIMS Students' Union v MIMS (AIR 2001 SC 3262), the Supreme Court said that the Fundamental duties are equally important like Fundamental rights, though the former are unenforceable. Both are prefixed by the same word “fundamental”. Every citizen of India is fundamentally duty-bound to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievements. The duty of evety citizen of India is the collective duty of the State. The court observed: Fundamental duties provide a valuable guide and aid to interpretation of Constitution (e.g. determination of reasonableness of reservation) and legal issues. In case of doubt or Constitution/Constitutional Law 67 choice, people’s wish as manifested through Art. 51-A, can serve as a guide riot only for resolving the issue but also for constructing or moulding the relief to be given by the courts. Recently, the ‘National Commission on the Review of the Constitution’ examined the operationalization of fundamental duties of the citizens and gave their considered recommendations. In UOI v R. Padmanabhan JT 2003 (7) 206, the Supreme Court has directed the Central Government to take appropriate steps for the implementation of the recommendations of the NCRC as expeditiously as possible. Fundamental Duties are a mixed bag of expectations and exhortations - A number of duties (clauses a, c and d) are enforceable today without specific incorporation in the Constitution. 4. THE EXECUTIVE (PRESIDENT/GOVERNOR, PRIME MINISTER) President is the executive head of India, while the Governor of a State. The position and powers of the two are more or less similar. Election of the President The President is elected by an electoral college, in accordance with the ‘system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote by secret ballot.’ The electoral college consists of (a) elected members of both Houses of Parliament, and (b) elected members of Legislative Assemblies of States (Art 54). Two cardinal principles in this regard are: (a) There shall be uniformity of representation of the different States at the election and parity shall be maintained between the States'as a whole and the Union (Art. 55), and (b) the vote of the States, in the aggregate, in the electoral college for the election of the President, shall be equal to that of the people of the country as a whole. A person who has ten proposers and ten seconders [Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Act, 1952] can be nominated as a candidate for President’s election. President’s election cannot be prevented or suspended on the ground that any vacancy exists in the._ electoral college electing him viz. when a State Assembly has been dissolved uhder Art. 356 andJts members are unable to participate in the election. The term of office of President is 5 years and he is eligible for re-election. Chief Justice of India or in his absence the senior-most Judge of the Supreme Court administers oath or affirmation to the President. Qualifications for Election as President The Constitution lays down both positive as well as negative qualifications: Positive Qualifications: A person must (Art. 58) - (i) be a citizen of India, (ii) have completed the age of 35 years, and",

The definition is important as the Fundamental rights are enforceable by writs against the 'State'. Hence, no writ can be issued against any person or authority which does not come within this definition. (ii) 'State' includes the Union and State Executives, and also the Parliament and the State Legislatures and hence under judicial review, executive acts and the 'Acts' made by Par- liament or State Legislatures can be declared ultra vires by the Supreme Court or the High Courts. (iii) Local and other authorities: (a) University is covered under 'other authorities'. The Supreme Court in Rajasthan Electricity Board V. Mohan Lai, overruled Shanta Bai's case and held that University was under 'Other Authorities'. (b) Municipalities, Corporations and other Local Self Government institutions are 'State'. In Sukhdev Singh V. Bhagatram the Supreme Court has given a wide interpreta- tion. 'Other authorities' includes LIC, Oil and Natural Gas Commission, Industrial Finance Corporation etc. If the autho- rity has Constitutional or Statutory powers it is a State whe- ther it is discharging Sovereign functions or not. If it is an agency or instrumentality of the State or is discharging the functions of the State then it is within the definition of 'State'. (iv) Not a State: (a) Private persons, Private Associations, Cooperative Societies, Societies covered under Societies Registration Act, Companies etc. are not 'State'. (b) Courts are not within the definition of State for purposes of Art. 12. 11.2 : Doctrine of Eclipse : Meaning : According to the concept of 'Judicial Review', a law which is against the Constitution is void and ultra vires the Constitution. msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page57 Our Constitution became operative from 26-1-1950. Hence, any law existing prior to the Constitution (Pre- Constitutional Law) and any law made subsequently (Post- Constitutional Law) would be void if the law is against the Constitution. Hence, a question arises. If a Pre-Constitutional Law is held void by the Court as against a provision in the Con- stitution, and subsequently, if that provision in the Consti- tution itself is amended by the Parliament, will the 'void law' become operative or not? The Supreme Court has held that in such cases, the 'void law' will become operative automatically after the amendment is made. The reason is the Constitution will have 'eclipsed' or darkened that 'law', but when the Constitution is amended, the eclipse is removed and hence proprio vigors, the law becomes operative. This is called the Doctrine of Eclipse. Case: Bhikaji Narayan V. State ofMadhya Pradesh (1955). The Motor Vehicles Act was amended by the State and provided for monopoly of Road Transport by the State. In view of Art.19 (l)(g), Right of Trade or Business, this law became operative from 26-1-1950 (the date of commenc- ement of the Constitution). Hence, it became eclipsed by the Constitution. However, on 18th June 1951, Art. 19 (l)(g) was itself amended providing for Nationalisation etc. With this amendment the eclipse was removed, and the monopoly law revived. Post Constitution Law : Deep Chand V. State of U.P. (1959). The U.P. Transport Act came into operation in 1950. It provided for Nationalisation. But, as there was no proper provision for compensation, this law was held bad. But the 4th Amendment made inadequacy of compensation not ques- tionable in any Court. Question was whether the bad mono- poly law became operative after the Amendment. The Supreme Court held that the doctrine of eclipse was not applicable. The reason, was the law was made in 1955. It became void ab initio. It was a still born law and hence dead. Hence no revival. A new law is to be enacted, if required by the State. Doctrine applied to Post-Constitutional Law : in D. Lodh V. District Judge the Supreme Court applied to Post- Constitutional Law. In this case, a suit for ejectment was decided in favour of the landlord, but due to U.P. Civil law, this was inexecutable. The law was amended in 1976 to remove such injustice. Held, the doctrine of eclipse applied and the decree was executable. msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page58 Chapter 12 EQUALITY 12.1: Right to Equality : (i) Art. 14 : Art. 14 of the Constitution States as follows : The State shall not deny to any person, 'equality before the law', or 'equal protection of the laws', within the territory of India. (ii) Equality before the Law : (a) This is a negative concept taken from the English Constitution. It implies the absence of any privilege in favour of any person. It means that among equals the law should be equal and should be equally administered and that 'like should be treated alike' (Jennings). It also means the right to sue and to be sued, to prosecute and to be prosecuted for the same kind of action should be the same for all without distinction of race, reli- gion,wealth, social status or political influence (Jennings). (b) Dicey's concept of Rule of law has equality as its central core. According to him it means the 'Supremacy of Law'. Equality requires that Justice must be available to all. Hence, Justice should not be denied to the accused who on grounds of poverty is not in a position to maintain an advocate to defend him .. Legal aid is provided in England under the Poor Prisoners Defence Act, and, Legal Aid and Advice Act. In the U.S, the Supreme Court held in Powell V. Alabama that under \"due process of law\", the State was under a duty to meet the expenses of defence. In this case, 6 negroes had been accused of ravishing a white girl to death.There was no defence.",

    "content": "aid is provided in England under the Poor Prisoners  Defence Act, and, Legal Aid and Advice Act. In the U.S, the  Supreme Court held in Powell V. Alabama that under \"due  process of law\", the State was under a duty to meet the  expenses of defence. In this case, 6 negroes had been accused  of ravishing a white girl to death.There was no defence. The Supreme Court declared that the state should pay for the defence. In India, in Tara Singh's Case, it was held that opportunity should be provided to such accused as per Art. 22. In Hasinara Khatoon V. State of Bihar, the Supreme Court has held that Justice required that accused should be defended or State should ensure such legal defence, at its own cost. If legal defence is not provided, the trial would be vitiated. High Court Rules have however provided for defence as a 'must* when the accused has no means. 'Legal Aid Clinics' are now protecting the interests of such persons in Lower Courts. msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page59 (c) Equal Subjection to Courts : According to Dicey, equa- lity before the law means that no man should be made to suffer in body or goods except for a distinct breach of law ; It also means that no man is above the law and that all are amenable to the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts. Dicey was against the Administrative tribunals as they differed fundamentally from the Ordinary courts. The tribu- nals do not follow the court procedures (Civil and Criminal) and also the law relating to Evidence.But, these tribunals had come to stay.Hence,the courts have imposed a duty on these tribunals that they should follow the principles of natural justice. (iii) Equal protection of the Laws :(a) This is a dynamic concept taken from the U.S.Constitution (14th Amendment). It implies equality of treatment in equal circumstances. The essence of it is that when persons are similarly placed they must be similarly treated. In the U.S. in Plussey V. Furguson, separate accommoda- tion provided to the Negroes and Whites in the Railways was upheld by the Supreme Court. This was the 'Separate but equal' concept. This was overruled in Brown V. Board of Education 1954. Separate schools had been provided for Negroes and Whites. A Negro's application was rejected by a White School. Held, this segregation was Ultra Vires,as violative of 'Equal protec- tion of the Laws'. 12.2 : Doctrine of Reasonable Classification : The leading case is KathiRaning V. St. ofSuarastra (1952). In this case, Das, J, stated the two tests for reasonable Classi- fication : (i) The classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes one group from the other, and (ii) The differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by legislation. Art. 14 forbids class legislation, but does not forbid reaso- nable classification. This means, the differentia must not be arbitrary. It must be based on some qualities or characteristics found in one group. These must be absent in the group left out. What is essential is that there must be a nexus between the differentia and the object of legislation. State of Bombay V.Balsara : The Bombay Prohibition Act, made it an offence to manufacture,sell or consume intoxi- cating liquor. Military canteens had been exempted. Balsara msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page60 challenged this. Held, Miliary officials form a separate class or group by themselves. Civilians are different. This had a reasonable relationship with the object of legislation. The Military officers had special duties and responsibilities and this justified a separate treatment to them. Chiranji Lai V. Union of India (1951) : The Sholapur Spinning Co. was taken over by the Central Govt. This was challenged as violative of Art. 14. Held, Companies under mal-administration formed a class ; and the object of legis- lation was to protect the shareholders.Held, legislation was valid. In the Bank Nationalisation case, the Supreme Court struck down the Banking Companies Act.There was hostile dis- crimination between 14 nationalised Banks and other Indian and Foreign Banks. Even new banks could be started and could do business.But, the 14 Banks had been taken over and hence prevented from doing business. Held, discriminatory. (The Act was suitably amended by Parliament later). Widened Meaning of Equality : In Maneka Gandhi's Case,the Govt. had impounded the passport, and this was held as \"not justified\". The Supreme Court held that equality was not limited to the \"judicial formula\" of reasonable classifi- cation. It was much -wider. The Legislative Act should not only pass the two tests of reasonable classification, but also be NOT ARBITRARY. Accordingly, impounding a passport without hearing was \"not fair\". (The petitioner was heard & passport issued.) In International Airport Authority Case, the court held that equality had an \"activist magnitude\" and embodied guarantee against arbitrariness. In Air India V. Meerza, the regulation that air-hostess should retire on attaining 35 years, or upon marriage, or upon first pregnancy, was held ultra vires, as this classification was arbitrary. In Mithu V. State of Punjab, Sn. 303. I.P.C.was struck down. In this case, if a person is guilty of murder under Sn. 3021.P.C., the court in its discretion may award death penalty, but under Sn.303 I.P.C. if the person, a prisoner (under life imprisonment), commits murder, then the court shall give death penalty. This classification was held bad as under Sn. 302, there was judicial discretion but there was no such discretion under Sn. 303. Hence Sn., 303 was arbitrary and bad. msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page61 Basis of Classification: Reasonable classification may be based on different grounds: (i) Geographical basis : Depending on the peculiar cir- cumstances and situations, the classification may be based on territorial grounds.",

Thus, in Ram Chandra V. State of Orissa, two Nationa- lisations Acts,to take over road transport for different areas in the State of Orissa were held valid, as there were material differences peculiar to the two Acts.But, districtwise distri- bution of seats in the Medical College was held bad in Rajendran V. Tamilnadu. Law providing for different fees in Medical and Engineering Colleges between residents and non-residents was held valid in Joshi V. State ofM.P. (ii) Historical basis: Merger, State reorganisation etc.may be grounds for reorganisation. In Pavitra Kumar V. State of W.B.,\\he different categories of Advocates into Barrister- advocates and non-barrister advocates was held valid for \"historical reasons\". (Now Under Advocates Act 1962 there is no such classification). Special immunity to Ex-Rulers in C.P.C. was held valid on historical grounds. (iii) Time as the basis : The basis of classification maybe based on date of operation of law. For instance, an enhanced tax rate may be imposed from a particular date. Pending cases may be taxed at old rates. This is not hit by Art. 14. (iv) Nature of persons, trade, calling or business: Classi- fication of persons, on the basis of age,for instance is valid (Sn. 11 Contract Act). Small Scale Industries, may be classified as one group for favoured treatment; Classification of News papers into Small, Medium and Big for levying customs duty on newsprint was held valid (Ex- press Newspaper Case). (v) Special Courts and Special Procedure: Leading case: Kathi Ranning V. State ofSaurastra. In re Special Courts Bill the Supreme Court has held that Special Courts and Special Procedures were valid if the law clearly lays down the guiding principles e.g. public safety, main- tenance of public order etc. The offences must be properly classified in relation to the objective to be achieved. (vi) Tax basis :The basis of tax must pass the test of msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page62 classification under Art. 14. Hence, tax on Virginia tobacco but no tax on country tobacco was held valid in E-I-Tobacco Case. (vii) Individual or group may be classified, if it is not arbitrary and answers the two tests. Eg. Ameerunisa V. Mehboob: There were continuous court litigations between two claimants. The Hyderabad Legisla ture passed the Walud Dowla Succession Act and gave the property of the deceased Nawab of Hyderabad to one party. The other party challenged this law as it denied its right to claim the property, just as any other citizen, in a court. Held, classification was bad. The essence of Art. 14 is that not only that there must be a reasonable classification having a relation to the objective to be achieved, but that such a classification itself should not be arbitrary. 12.3 : Art. 14 and Special Courts : Whether Special Courts may be constituted by the Legis- lature to try certain types of offences, was discussed in detail by the Supreme Court in 'in re Special Courts 'case. The Court held that the Bill was valid. The classification of offences during Emergency had been defined. The duration had been specified. There were no unguided and uncontrolled powers to the Executive. The guide lines were clear. Art. 14 guarantees to all persons (1) Equality before the law and (2) Equal protection of the Laws, within the territory of India. Equality before the law means that among equals, law should be equal and should be equally administered, and that like should be treated alike. It includes the right to sue and to be sued, to prosecute and to be prosecuted without any distinction of religion race, Wealth, Social Status or Political Influence. This includes the concept of \"Rule of Law\". According to Dicey, this means the supremacy of law, and, that no man is above the Law; It means that no person shall suffer in body or goods except for a distinct breach of law, and, that all persons are amenable to the jurisdiction of the ordinary Courts. msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page63 What Dicey meant by this was that every official from the Prime Minister, down to a constable, is under the same responsibility, for every act done without legal justification, as an ordinary citizen is. Further, he is subject to the juris- diction of the same courts as are available to citizens. In State of West Bengal VAnwarAli, the Act had provided for special courts to conduct \"speedier trial of certain offen- ces\". The Govt.could select the offences for speedy trial. The Supreme Court held that this was an arbitrary Power and violated Art. 14. No guidelines were given by the Act to classify the offences. Further, the procedure for trial also varied from the general procedure provided in the Cr.P.C. This was also held bad. However, in Kathai Raning V.State of Saurastra, the law had given proper guidelines and also had specified the cate- gories of offence that could be selected for special trial. Hence, the law was held good. In its advisory opinion, in \"In re special courts case \", the Supreme Court held that special courts set up to try offences committed during national emergency of 1975-77,did not violate Art. 14. and the procedure provided therein, was held not against the Constitution. Hence, in India ,Special Courts may be constituted by law, but the law should classify the offences or provide clear guidelines to the Govt. to classify. There should be no room for any arbitrary discretion of the executive. The procedure should not be substantially different from the one prescribed by ordinary law. msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page64 Chapter 13 FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND EXPRESSION Art. 19 (l)(a) of the Constitution guarantees to every Citizen freedom of speech and expression.",

Nowhere in the world, freedom of speech is guaranteed in absolute terms. The U.S. Constitution in its 1st Amendment stated : 'Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or of the Press'. The Supreme Court stated in Schenck V.United States : 'Free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre, and causing a panic'. The Court formulated the 'clear and present danger test' as a restriction in Dennis Vs. United States. The Smith Act was challenged in this case.(Teaching etc. of overthrowing of Government by force was made an offence in this Act). This was held good. Similarly, Censorship restrictions have been upheld. (Don Juonfilm case). Instead of leaving to the Courts as in the U.S.to define the scope, our Constitution has provided that reasonable restric- tions could be imposed by the Parliament and State Legisla- tures on the following grounds: Art. 19 (2): (a) Sovereignty and Integrity of India. (b) Security of the State. (c) Friendly relations with Foreign States. (d) Public Order. (e) Decency or Morality. (f) Contempt of Court. (g) Defamation. (h) Incitement to an offence. Scope : The freedom of speech and 'expression': The freedom is comprehensive and includes not only words spoken, but also the freedom of the Press, which is the basic essential of political liberty for proper functioning of demo- cracy. The basic principle behind this freedom is the right of the people to know the truth. (i) Ramesh Thaper V. State of Madras 1950 : Madras Govt's, ban order of entry and circulation of 'Cross Roads' a Bombay Weekly, was held ultra vires. msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page65 (ii) Brij Bhushan V. Delhi: Precensorship of 'Organiser' was held Ultra Vires the Constitution. Held,the 'Security of the State, in Act 19(2) did not empower the State to impose restrictions to control 'Public Order'. This led to the First Amendment which introduced three grounds: 'public Order' 'Friendly relationship with Foreign Countries' and 'incite- ment to an offence.' (iii) In Shailabala Devi's Case, the Supreme Court allowed publication of 'Sangram' as it contained only meaningless words, though high sounding and bombastic. (iv) Bennett Colemen V. India: The G.O. prescribing the number of pages, at 10 to all newspapers under Newsprint Control Order was held ultra vires as it affected the circulation of newspapers. In Sakal Papers V. Union, the restriction on prices of newspapers with reference to pages and sizes,was held bad,by the Supreme Court as it affected publication of supplements etc. (v) Lady Chatterly's lover : This book was banned as obscene. A book seller challenged this, but the Supreme Court held that the ban was within permissible limits of Decency and Morality and hence valid.He was convicted (Ranjit V. State of Maharashtra). (vi) K.A. Abbas V. Union of India : Film censorship was upheld in this case as motion picture stirs up emotions than any other media. For the film'The Tale of four cities' 'U' Certificate was not granted. The Court upheld the action of the Govt. The classification of films into\"A\" (for adults only) and 'U' (for all) was held valid. (vii) In Namboodripad's Case, the Supreme Court upheld his conviction and held that his attack on the judiciary, calculated to lower the prestige of the judges amounted to contempt of Court. Conclusion: The Courts in India have upheld the freedom of speech and expression as a precious right and as the quint-essence of democracy. msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page66 Chapter 14 PERSONAL FREEDOMS 14.1: Rule against Retrospective Criminal Law : Art. 20 (1): (i) One of the cardinal principles of Criminal Law is that \"no ex post facto \" Criminal Law shall be made by the State. This means the law must be prospective only. If the law is to have effect from an anterior date, that would be against this concept. This reason is the act is innocent when it is done, but, a law made subsequently has made the innocent act punishable with retrospective effect. This rule available in England and U.S. is embodied in Art. 20 (1). (ii) The U.S. Constitution [Art. 1 Sn. 9 (3)] declares 'no ex post facto law shall be passed'. The leading case in Colder V. Bull. In this Case, the U.S. Supreme Court explained ex post facto law: (a) Making an act punishable which act was innocent at the time of commission, (b) Imposing a greater penalty in such cases, than what is already provided: or (c) Changing the procedure to the prejudice of the accused. (iii) Art. 20 (1): Provides that no person should be convicted of any offence, except for violation of law in force at the time of the commission of the offence. Further, it states that no person should be subject to a greater penalty than that which might be inflicted for the offence at the time of commission of the offence. But, in respect of procedure to be followed, the Supreme Court has held that there is no right to the accused to any particular procedure to be followed. The reason is all that procedural law are prospective. Shiv Bahadur V. St. of Vindhya Pradesh. The I.P.C. was extended to Vindhya Pradesh from Sept. 1949, but a Minister was charge-sheeted for a bribe taken in April 1949. It was contended that the extension of law was ex post facto law.

In addition he was put a fine of Rs. 50,0007- under Criminal Law Amendment Act 1949. (A fine equal to the money received as a bride could be imposed under this.) Held, the Act of 1949 was ex post facto law and hence, could not be applied to K. In Berai V. Henry, the prevention of Food Adulteration Act had provided life imprisonment and the accused was under- going trial when the law was amended and punishment msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page67 reduced to 3 years. Accused could claim this, as it was beneficial to him. 14.2 : Right against Double jeopardy : One basic principle of Criminal Law is that no person who has been accused of an offence shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once. This principle is contained in Art. 20 (2) of our Constitution and also in S. 300Cr.P.C. The origin of this is in the English Law Nemo dabet Bis vaxari (no one shall be vexed twice). This has two rules namely: (i) Autrefois acquit (previous acquittal); (ii) Autrefois convict (previous conviction). According to this if a person has been prosecuted and either convicted or acquitted, the accused snould not &e tried ag; by any Court in India for the same offence. ^ In Venkata Raman V. Union of India, V was subjected to a departmental inquiry and was dismissed from Central Government Services on grounds of bribery. The police arrested him under 1611.P.C. for bribery. He contended that he should not be tried again. The Supreme Court held that the departmental proceeding was not a prosecution and therefore he could not get the benefit. In Maqbul Hussain V. State of Bombay—M was subject to an inquiry by the custom authorities who confiscated the goods from him and also fined him. Held Custom proceeding as not a prosecution. According to the Supreme Court, prosecution and punish- ment must be read in a conjective sense. That is, if a person is prosecuted and punished, he should not be tried again. Hence if a person is prosecuted and acquitted, the constitution is silent about this. But S. 300 Cr. P.C. provides that if a person is prosecuted and convicted or acquitted he should not be tried again for the same offence. Exceptions : Sn. 300 has provided for four exceptions. (a) Lack of Jurisdiction of the Court. (b) Distinct and separate offence than the one tried. (c) Consequences of an act resulting in a different offence altogether, e.g.: Ais punished for grievous hurt but the injured person dies as a result of the injuries, A may be tried for culpable homicide. (d) Does not apply to execution proceedings. In State of Bombay V. Apte : A was convicted for Criminal Breach of Trust under I.P.C. and under Insurance msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page68 Act. The Sessions convicted on the first, but acquitted as the necessary permission had not been taken under the Insurance Act, in the second. Thereupon, sanction was obtained and a fresh complaint was filed. Held, in the second prosecution the ingre- dients of the offence was different. Hence, in the second prosecution and ingredients of the offence were different. Hence, Art. 20 (2) did not apply. He could be tried. 14.3 : Right against Self-Incrimination : Art. 20 (3) : (i) One fundamental principle of Criminal Law is the right against Self-Incrimination. (ii) Origin: The Principle has its origin in England where it developed as a rule of evidence as a revolt against inqui- sitorial and unjust methods of interrogating the accused per- sons. This found its Constitutional Status in the 5th Amend- ment in the U. S. Constitution. The rationale for the right is that of protection to the innocent, and a safeguard against tyrannical prosecution. (iii) Art. 20 (3) : No person accused of an offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself. This is also called as rule against testimonial compulsion. According to the Evidence Act, the burden of proving the guilt of the accused is on the prosecution. The accused cannot be compelled to give evidence against himself. Certain conditions must be satisfied to get the benefit: (a) 'Accused of an offence' : The protection is given to only an accused. A person is accused when the First Infor mation Report (F.I.R.) is filed against him, or a Complaint is made to a Magistrate. Hence, statements made by a person before the custom officials, are, without accusation and hence not within Art. 20(3). (b) The protection is not available to a witness under this article.

    "content": "leading case is State  of Bombay V. Kathi Kalu Oghad. The Supreme Court dis- posed of a batch of four appeals. In the Bombay appeal,  specimen handwriting had been taken from the prisoner; in  the Punjab appeal the confession of the prisoner led to the  discovery of stolen property, guns and rifles. Impressions of  palms and fingers were taken in the presence of the magistrate  in another appeal. In the West Bengal appeal, opium had been received by the prisoner through Railways and to compare his signature on the Railway Way Bill, the police had taken the specimen signature. Eleven Judges of the Supreme Court disposed of the case. It was held that material evidence i.e., the taking of specimen signatures, thumb impression, handwriting, foot or palm print, for the purpose of identification is not against Art. 20(3). Similarly demonstration or parade for identification is also not hit by Art. 20(3). But there should be no duress. For example, if 'A' the accused gives information to the police about weapons used in the commission of an offence, and if in pursuance of it the police discover the said weapons, then the fact of discovery is allowed. This is valid under Art. 20(3). (e) Compulsion is Prohibited : Compulsion means 'du- ress'. It includes physical or mental torture, or 'third degree' methods. Art. 20(3) safeguards against investigating officers who 'sit comfortably in the Shade, rubbing red pepper into a poor devil's (accused) eyes, rather than go about in the sun hunting up for evidence'. However, mere statement made in police custody does not infer duress, but, it must be proved as a fact in the msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page70 circumstances of each case. In Nandini Satpathy (Ex-Chief Minister of Orissa) case, the accused was called to Police Station to answer questions on charges of corruption. She refused to answer and claimed protection under Art. 20(3). Held, accused is entitled to keep her mouth shut, if the questions were of such a nature as to implicate her in this or in any other offence. Tape-recorded statements (taken without duress) were allowed in YusufAli case. In Kuttan Pillai 's case, a document recovered on search of house of accused was held not under duress. 14.4 : Right to life and Personal Liberty : Art. 21: (i) Art. 21 of our Constitution declares : \"No person shall be deprived of his life or Personal Liberty except according to procedure established by law\". The drafting committee, added the word \"personal\", to restrict the wide meaning of liberty. Though there was much discussion to adopt \"due process of law\" of U. S. Constitution (5th and 14th Amendments), it ultimately preferred the Japanese expression \"procedure established by law\". In England, the Magna Carta (1215) declared \"No man shall be taken or imprisoned .... save by law of the land\". (ii) Right to life : The Constitution guarantees the right to life but subject to procedure established by law. Life can be taken away by the State according to law. In Jagmohan Singh V. State of U. P. it was held that \"death sentence\" was not violative of Art. 21. Life does not mean the mere animal existence of man, but, \"extends to protection of every limb of the body through which the soul communicates with the outer world\". msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page71 (iii) Personal liberty : According to Blackstone, this means \"the power of locomotion, or moving of one's person to whatsoever place one's own inclination may direct, without imprisonment or restraint unless by due process of law\". Wider Meaning to include Arts. 21 and 19 : The Supreme Court had held in Gopalan's case, that Arts. 21 and 19 were mutually exclusive, and hence, preventive detention which was covered under Art. 21, could not be tested with the freedoms of Art. 19. This has been overruled in S. N. Sarkar V. State of West Bengal. Hence, the Preventive Detention Law, or any such law, may be tested under Art. 19. Hence the position is that while Art. 19(1) deals with a species of rights, or freedoms, Art. 21 takes in and comprises the residue. In Kharak Singh V State ofU.P. (1963), the petitioner was tried for dacoity but was released. The police opened a history sheet and put him under surveillance. They made domiciliary visits during nights, and the Supreme Court held that such visits were without the authority of law and hence,void. But in Govind V. State ofM.P. there was a Clear Law for domiciliary visits, and the Supreme Court upheld such visits. (iv) Procedure established by law: \"Procedure\" refers to the manner and form of enforcing law. The word \"law\" was understood to mean enacted law and hence, procedure established by law meant procedure prescribed by the Legislature. Such a law could not be tested as to its reasonableness (Gopalan 's case). This was changed by the Supreme Court in Hoskot V State of Maharashtra where it was held that 'law' must be 'reasonable'. Here a Reader of a college was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment; he served the sentence. He had not been given a copy of the judgment. Held, procedure established by law means 'fair and reasonable procedure'. A copy should have been given msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page72 to him. This was confirmed further in Menaka Gandhi V. Union of India. Thus in procedure established by law the 'law' should be valid as per Arts. 21 and 22 and must be reasonable. It must pass the tests of reasonableness under Art. 19. This wide interpretation has raised the standards of liberty to almost match with the American concept of 'due process of law'. Passport Cases : (a) In Satwant Singh V. A.P.O. (1967), the passport was not renewed to the petitioner to go abroad. The Supreme Court held that to go abroad was a fundamental right, and Satwant was entitled to his passport.",

This  wide interpretation has raised the standards of liberty to  almost match with the American concept of 'due process  of law'. Passport Cases : (a) In Satwant Singh V. A.P.O. (1967),      the passport was not renewed to the petitioner to go abroad. The Supreme Court held that to go abroad was a fundamental  right, and Satwant was entitled to his passport. To meet this case the Passport Act 1967 was enacted by the Parliament. (b) In Maneka Gandhi V. Union of India (1978), the im- pounding of the passport was questioned. The Supreme Court, overruled Satwant Singh's case and held, that to go abroad was not a fundamental right. But, it held under (Art. 21) \"procedure established by law,\" the law must be reason- able and must answer the tests of Art. 19. Hence, the denial of passport may affect the right to profession abroad etc. Passport was issued to the petitioner. (v) Art. 21 and National Emergency: When the National Emergency is proclaimed (Art. 352), the President may sus- pend Art. 14, 21 and 22. In the Habeas Corpus Case (Shukla V. A.D.M., Jabbalpur, 1976), the Supreme Court held that as the remedy had been suspended the Court could not go into the validity of the detention order. To meet this decision, the 44th Amendment has provided that Art. 21 cannot be suspended during national emergency. (vi) Extension of Art. 21 : Art. 21 has been extended to give protection to—(1) Under-trial prisoners; (2) Prisoners serving a sentence; (3) Prisoners subject to ill-treatment or inhuman treatment; (4) Persons against whom no trial is msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page73 launched for years (Pahadia V. State of Bihar)', (5) Person, who was kept in prison for years even after order of release by courts [Supreme Court has ordered for payment of com- pensation]; (6) Case of blinding of under-trials (Khatri V. State of Bihar); (7) Cases of abuse of young prisoners or under-trials etc.; (8) Free legal aid to indigent accused (Khatoon V. State of Bihar); (9) Cases of 'leg iron chains' to prisoner (Sunil Batra V. Delhi Administration); (10) Consul- tation with a lawyer in the prison, without the custom officer being present within the hearing distance (Francis V. Delhi); (11) Prisoners' right to publish books (State of Maharashtra V. Panduranga). (vii) Relationship between Arts. 21 and 22 : In Gopalan V. State of Madras, Gopalan who had been detained under the Preventive Detention Act, challenged the Act as violative of Art. 21. The contention of the State that Art. 21 did not apply as there was Art. 22 for arrest or detention, was rejected by the Supreme Court. It held that Art. 21 dealt with the substantive aspect, whereas Art. 22 dealt with the procedural aspect. In view ofManeka Gandhi's case, 'the law' must be 'reasonable' also (Art. 19). 14.4 A Right to Education Act 2009 Article 45 states “The State shall endeavour to provide, within a period of ten years, from the commencement of the Constitution, for free and compulsory education for all children until they complete the age of 14 years.” In 2002, the 86th Constitutional Amendment was passed by the Parliament adding Article 21A, to Article 21. Thus it became a fundamental Right like Right to life. msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page74 New Article: Article 21 A states: \"the state shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of 6 to 14 years as the state may, by law determine\".

    "content": "Justice  Radhakrishnan dissented   ]     The Supreme Court  has brought all educational  institutions within RTE’s ambit except   unaided minority  institutions  It has held that the Act is operative from the academic year  2012-2013 itself and  would not apply retrospectively to  any admissions or to resident students in boarding schools. The private schools’ contention that such mandatory reservation would drain their resources was answered by the government, which promised reimbursement of money to the extent of the reservation. The Court held: . Article 21A requires non-state actors to achieve the socio-economic rights of children in the sense that they shall not destroy or impair those rights and also owe a duty of care. The State, however, cannot free itself from obligations under Article 21A by offloading or outsourcing its obligation to private State actors like unaided private educational institutions or to coerce them to act on the State's dictate. Private educational institutions have to empower the children, through developing their skills, learning and other capacities, human dignity, self-esteem and self-confidence and to respect their constitutional rights. Article 21 read with 21A, therefore, cast an obligation on the State and State alone. . I am, therefore, of the considered view that Article 21A, as such, does not cast msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page77 any obligation on the private unaided educational institutions to provide free and compulsory education to children of the age 6 to 14 years. Article 21A casts constitutional obligation on the State to provide free and compulsory education to children of the age 6 to 14 years. msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page78 14.5 : Right against Arrest and Detention: Art.22: (i) Protection : Art.22(l) to (3) deal with the protection given to an arrested person. (a) Any person, who is arrested, shall not be detained in custody without being informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds of arrest; (b) Every person who is arrested should be produced before the Magistrate within 24 hours of his arrest, excluding the journey time; (c) Every arrested person, shall not be denied the right to consult and to be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice. (ii) Preventive Detention Law : There are two types of detention—(1) Punitive and (2) Preventive. It is punitive if the detention is according to the sentence given by the Court, but in preventive detention, the person is detained not for any proved guilt, but to prevent him from the possibility of committing an offence. The objective is 'prevention is better than cure'. Safeguards: The preventive detention law must be according to Art. 22(4) to (7) and also Arts. 14,19, 21 and Seventh Schedule. The provisions may be summarised as follows (with 44th Amendment): (a) The preventive detention law may provide for detention up to 2 months; (b) The grounds of detention must be communicated to msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page79 the detinue, as soon as may be; (c) If the Advisory Board gives its opinion that there are no sufficient reasons, the detention made after 2 months is void (S. D. Prasad V. State of Bihar); (d) The Advisory Board shall consist of a chairman, a serving High Court Judge and two other members (may be retired judges), it should be constituted according to the direction of the concerned High Court Chief Justice; (e) Parliament is empowered to prescribe the maximum period of detention in any class or classes of cases; (f) The detaining authority, may not disclose the facts of detention, if it considers that it would be against the public interest to disclose. Recent legislation : The Preventive Detention Act 1950, which was being renewed from year to year, lapsed in 1969. But, in its place the MIS A (Maintenance of Internal Security Act 1971) was made. Sn.l7Aof this Act, was struck down by the Supreme Court, as it provided for 21 months detention without consulting the Board (Sarkar V. State of W.B.). In 1974, the Parliament enacted COFEPOSA (Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Act), 1974. The Parliament repealed the MIS A in 1978. In its place, it has passed the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA). msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page80 Chapter 15 SECULAR STATE Arts. 25 to 28 : (i) The Framers of our Constitution incorporated the Free- dom of religion which is the hall mark of Secularism in Arts.25 to 28. They were inspired by the U.S. Constitution, where according to Jefferson there is a wall of separation between the Church and the State. (First Amendment to U.S. Constitution). In our constitution, 42nd Amendment added \"secular\" to the preamble. Secular is opposed to \"religious state (Theo- cratic State) \" and \"Irreligious state \". The State should be neutral, and, treat all religions equally. Religious practises, worshipping of God etc. are left to the dictates of every individuals conscience. The State should not interfere.lt should not aid one religion or prefer one religion over another. It should not collect any religious taxes.This is the essence of separation of the church from the State. (ii) Freedom of Conscience : Art. 25. All persons are equally entitled to the freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess, practise and propagate religion, (a) This is subject to public order, morality health and other provisions of part III. (b) State may by law regulate or restrict any economic, financial, political or other secular activity of the religion. (c) State may provide for (1) Social Welfare and reform or (2) Throwing open of Public Hindu religious institutions to all classes of Hindus. (Hindu includes a Sikh, Jain or msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page81 Buddhist. A Sikh may wear a Kirpan). In \"Anand Marg\" case, a ban imposed under Sn. 144 Cr.P.C. on Tandava dance with daggers, trisul, skulls etc.in public places was held valid on grounds of public order.

(iii) Freedom of Religious Institutions : Art. 26 . Every  religious denomination has the right:  (a) To establish and maintain religious and charitable insti  tutions. (b) To manage its religious affairs. (c) To own and acquire property, and (d) To administer such property. (iv) These two Articles deal with the basic essentials of our Secularism. Art. 25 refers to persons whereas Art. 26 gua- rantees freedom to Religious Institutions. These are subject to certain restrictions. The limit and scope of these have ben discussed by the Supreme Court in a number of cases : Commissioner ofH.R. Endowments V. Laxmindra Thirtha Swamiar (Sirur Mutt Case) : The Madras Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment Act had provided for provisions to deprive the mahant of his right to administer the property.lt enabled the Commissioner to enter the premises and also the sanctum sanctorum of the temple.The Supreme Court struck down these provisions.lt declared that 'A religion is not only a code of ethical rules, but it contains rituals, ceremonies, modes of worship and also observances regarding dress, food etc. There is internal autonomy and no outside authority has jurisdiction to interfere.' In Venkataramana Devaru V.State of Mysore, the Madras Temple Entry Authorisation Act, provided for the entry of Harijans to any Hindu temple. This was challenged by the trustees of the temple belonging to Gowda Saraswaths. They claimed under Art. 26 (1), that they had the rights to manage the affairs of the temple and hence, they could bar the entry of any person. Held, Art. 25(2),to throw open Hindu temples msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page82 to all Hindus prevailed over Art. 26(1). The law was held valid. In Saifuddin V State ofBombay,ihe right of a religious head to excommunicate a member from the community was held valid. In Ratilal V. State of Bombay, the Charity Commissioner was authorised to deviate the funds of public trust for pur- poses other than what the donors had indicated. Held, this violated Art.26. State ofRajastan V. Sajjanlal. The temple of Lord Jagan- nath at Puri is a denominational temple. If a law provided for a non-member of the denomination to be a member or chair- man of the Managing Committee, then it would be violative of Arts. 25 and 26.As the Rajastan Public Trust Act did not have such an effect, it was held valid. In \"National Anthem\" case our Supreme Court held that \"religious objectors\" (Jehovas) could not be compelled to salute the national flag. Three children, who stood up respectfully, but refused to sing national anthem were expelled from school. The court followed the American Supreme Court (Barnette's Case), and held that standing respectfully but not singing national anthem, was not violative of any law. The expulsion order was quashed. In Archaka's Case, the Supreme Court held that the office of Archaka is secular, and, hence a Hindu, who is qualified in Agamas etc. as required by the Hindu Temple, should not be denied of his opportunity in appointment on grounds of caste. (v) Freedom from religious taxes : Art. 27 declares that no person should be compelled to msrlawbooks© Constitution of India next.>> Page83 pay any taxes or tolls to promote or maintain any particular religion or its denomination. In Sri Jagannath V. State ofOrissa, the Supreme Court held valid a fee levied by the Orissa H.R.E. Act, as there was no favour to any particular religion or religious denomination. In Swamiar's Case, the Supreme Court held, a fee 5% of the total income of the religious institution per annum was a 'tax' and hence the Madras Legislature was incompetent. The levy was held ultra vires. (vi) Art. 28 states that religious instructions shall not be provided in Educational Institutions wholly maintained out of State Funds. (a) a State may administer an Educational institution creat ed under a trust or endowment which requires imparting of religious instruction. (b) (c) In State recognised or aided public educational institu tions if there is any religious instruction or worship, compul sory attendance of any person is barred. But, voluntary atten dance is not barred. Similarly a minor may attend if his guardian has given consent.",

M P Jain Indian Constitutional Law/Volume 1/PART V POLITICAL AND CIVIL RIGHTS/CHAPTER XX FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS (1) CHAPTER XX Fundamental Rights (1) A. CONCEPT OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS Since the 17th century, if not earlier, human thinking has been veering round to the theory that man has certain essential, basic, natural and inalienable rights or freedoms and it is the function of the state, in order that human liberty may be preserved, human personality developed, and an effective social and democratic life promoted, to recognise these rights and freedoms and allow them a free play. The concept of human rights can be traced to the natural law philosophers, such as, Locke and Rousseau. The natural law philosophers philosophized over such inherent human rights and sought to preserve these rights by propounding the theory of \"social compact\".1 According to LOCKE, man is born \"with a title to perfect freedom and an uncontrolled enjoyment of all the rights and privileges of the Law of Nature\" and he has by nature a power \"to preserve his property--that is, his life, liberty, and estate, against the injuries and attempts of other men.\"2 The Declaration of the French Revolution, 1789, which may be regarded as a concrete political statement on Human Rights and which was inspired by the LOCKEIAN philosophy declared: \"The aim of all political association is the conservation of the natural and inalienable rights of man\". The concept of human rights protects individuals against the excesses of the state. The concept of human rights represents an attempt to protect the individual from oppression and injustice. In modern times, it is widely accepted that the right to liberty is the very essence of a free society and it must be safeguarded at all times. The idea of guaranteeing certain rights is to ensure that a person may have a minimum guaranteed freedom. The underlying idea in entrenching certain basic and Fundamental Rights is to take them out of the reach of transient political majorities. It has, therefore, come to be regarded as essential that these rights be entrenched in such a way that they may not be violated, tampered or interfered with by an oppressive government. With this end in view, some written constitutions guarantee a few rights to the people and forbid governmental organs from interfering with the same. In that case, a guaranteed right can be limited or taken away only by the elaborate and formal process of constitutional amendment rather than by ordinary legislation. These rights are characterised as Fundamental Rights. The entrenched Fundamental Rights have a dual aspect. From one point of view, they confer justiciable rights on the people which can be enforced through the courts against the government. From another point of view, the Fundamental Rights constitute restrictions and limitations on government action, whether it is taken by the Centre, or a State or a local government. The government cannot take any action, administrative or legislative, by which a Fundamental Right is infringed. Entrenchment means that the guaranteed rights cannot be taken away by an ordinary law. A law curtailing or infringing an entrenched right would be declared to be unconstitutional. If ever it is deemed necessary to Page 943 curtail an entrenched right, that can only be done by the elaborate and more formal procedure by way of a constitutional amendment. As the Supreme Court has observed,3 the purpose of enumerating Fundamental Rights in the Constitution \"is to safeguard the basic human rights from the vicissitudes of political controversy and to place them beyond the reach of the political parties who, by virtue of their majority, may come to form the government at the centre or in the State\". The modern trend of guaranteeing Fundamental Rights to the people may be traced to the Constitution of the U.S.A. drafted in 1787. The U.S. Constitution was the first modern Constitution to give concrete shape to the concept of human Rights by putting them in to the Constitution and making them justiciable and enforceable through the instrumentality of the courts. The original U.S. Constitution did not contain any Fundamental Rights. There was trenchant criticism of the Constitution on this score. Consequently, the Bill of Rights came to be incorporated in the Constitution in 1791 in the form of ten amendments which embody the LOCKEIAN ideas about the protection of life, liberty and property.4 The nature of the Fundamental Rights in the U.S.A. has been described thus: \"The very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials, to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts. One's right to life, liberty, and property, to free speech, a free press, freedom of worship and assembly and other Fundamental Rights may not be submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.\"5 In modern times, the concept of the people's basic rights has been given a more concrete and universal texture by the Charter of Human Rights enacted by the United Nations Organization (U.N.O.),6 and the European Convention on Human Rights.7 The Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights inter alia declares: \"Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world\". The concept of Fundamental Rights thus represents a trend in the modern democratic thinking.8 The enforcement of human rights is a matter of major significance to modern constitutional jurisprudence.",

    "content": "concept of Fundamental Rights thus represents a trend in the modern democratic thinking.8 The enforcement of human rights is a matter of major significance to modern constitutional jurisprudence. The incorporation of Fundamental Rights as enforceable rights in the modern constitutional documents as well as the internationally recognised Charter of Human Rights emanate from the doctrine of natural law and natural rights. For sometime now a new trend is visible in India, viz., to relate the Fundamental Rights in India to the International Human Rights. While interpreting the Fundamental Rights provisions in the Indian Constitution, the Supreme Court has drawn from the International Declarations on Human Rights.9 The Supreme Court, for example, has made copious references to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948, and observed: \"The applicability of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and principles thereof may have to be read, if need be, into the domestic jurisprudence\".10 There is no formal declaration of people's Fundamental Rights in Britain. The orthodox doctrine of the Sovereignty of Parliament prevailing there does not envisage a legal check on the power of Parliament which is, as a matter of legal theory, free to make any law even though it abridges, modifies or abolishes any basic civic right and liberty of the people.11 The power of the executive is however limited in the sense that it cannot interfere with the rights of the people without the sanction of law.12 There prevails in Britain the concept of Rule of Law which represents, in short, the thesis that the executive is answerable to the courts for any action which is contrary to the law of the land. Rule of law constitutes no legal restraint on the legislative power of Parliament and, thus, cannot be equated to the concept of Fundamental Rights. Page 944 Until 1998, the protection of individual freedom in Britain, therefore, rested not on any constitutional guarantees but on public opinion, good sense of the people, strong common law traditions favouring individual liberty and the Parliamentary form of government. British lawyers often questioned the very basis of the theory of declaring basic civil rights in a constitutional document. The British model could not be duplicated elsewhere. The fact remains that Britain is a small and homogeneous nation, having deep-rooted democratic traditions. But these conditions do not prevail in other countries which are composed of diverse elements, having no deep-rooted traditions of individual liberty, and which, therefore, face very different problems from those of Britain. Even in Britain, there was an ever growing realisation that guaranteed civil rights do serve a useful purpose and that Britain should also have a written Bill of Rights.13 Britain had accepted the European Charter on Human Rights.14 But this was not good enough because the Charter did not bind Parliament but could be used only to interpret the local law. The feeling was that law made by Parliament was in essence law made by the House of Commons. This, in practice, meant that a government having support of a majority in the House (though it had the support only of a minority of electorate), could often force through whatever legislation it desired. What was, therefore, necessary was a Bill of Rights which could curb parliamentary legislative power. As SCARMAN observed:15 \"Without a Bill of Rights protected from repeal, amendment, or suspension by the ordinary processes of a bare Parliamentary majority controlled by the government of the day, human Rights will be at risk.\"16 Ultimately, the British Parliament enacted the Human Rights Act, 1998. The purpose of the Act is to give effect to the rights and freedoms guaranteed under the European Convention on Human Rights. The Act is a significant constitutional innovation. The Act incorporates the Convention in Schedule I. These are the rights to which the Act gives effect. All legislation, so far as possible, is to be read and given effect to in a way which is compatible with convention rights [ s. 3(1)(a)]. S. 2(1)(a) requires a Court determining a question regarding a convention right, to take into account any \"judgment, decision, declaration or a advisory opinion of the European Court of Human Rights, so far as the same is relevant to the proceedings in question.\" Under s. 4(1), the Court may make a declaration that a legal provision is incompatible with a convention right. In such a case, under s. 10(1)(b), the Minister may by order make such amendments to the legislation as he considers necessary to remove the incompatibility. Thus, the Minister is empowered to make \"remedial orders\" to remove incompatibilities between primary legislation (as passed by Parliament) and the Convention. But a draft of the order has to be approved by both Houses of Parliament. The British Act falls short of a declaration of Fundamental Rights in the Constitution (such as is the case in India) in several respects; viz.: (1) In India, if a law is incompatible with a Fundamental Right, the law is void.17Not so in Britain. The Human Rights Act does not provide the courts with the power to strike down legislation which is inconsistent with the Convention rights. A judicial declaration of incompatibility does not make the legislation void. In fact, such a declaration does not affect the validity of the law at all. (2) The incompatibility may be removed by the Minister with the approval of Parliament. If the Minister does not seek to remove the incompatibility, the law in question continues to exist. This means that Parliament is free, if it so chooses, to enact and maintain in force legislation that is incompatible with the Convention rights. Not so in India where a void law is regarded as non-est.18 (3) The British Act is only an Act passed by Parliament. Parliament can repeal or amend the same by passing another Act. The Act is not entrenched against repeal but can be repealed in the ordinary way.",

    "content": "the other hand, a declaration of Fundamental Rights in the Constitution is of a more enduring and abiding nature than a mere statutory declaration of rights because to make any change in the Fundamental Rights, the Constitution needs to be amended which is a much Page 945 more arduous and elaborate procedure than passing or amending an ordinary law.19 The Australian Constitution, following the traditions of Britain, does not have a Bill of Rights but guarantees only a few rights, e.g., freedom of religion.20 In a federal country, the problem becomes more complicated as there may be attacks on individual liberty and freedom not only at the Central level, but even at the state level. In the modern era, it has become almost a matter of course to prescribe formally the rights and liberties of the people which are deemed worthy of protection from government interference. The wide acceptance of the notion that a formal Bill of Rights is a near necessity in the effective constitutional government arises, to some extent, from a feeling that mere custom or tradition alone cannot provide to the Fundamental Rights the same protection as their importance deserves. \"The unique English situation is not simply exportable, and other nations have generally felt that their governments need the constant reminder which a bill of rights provides, while their people need the reassurance which it can supply.\"21 An outstanding example of this trend is Canada. To begin with, the Canadian Constitution had only a few guaranteed Rights.22 Then, the Canadian Parliament enacted a law laying down basic Rights of the people.23 Being only a law made by Parliament, it did not constitute any restriction on Parliament itself. The matter has now been taken further. The Canadian Constitution has been amended and a Charter of Rights has been formally incorporated therein in 1982.24 B. FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IN INDIA Coming to India, a few good reasons made the enunciation of the Fundamental Rights in the Constitution rather inevitable. For one thing, the main political party, the Congress, had for long been demanding these Rights against the British rule. During the British rule in India, human rights were violated by the rulers on a very wide scale. Therefore, the framers of the Constitution, many of whom had suffered long incarceration during the British regime, had a very positive attitude towards these rights. Secondly, the Indian society is fragmented into many religious, cultural and linguistic groups, and it was necessary to declare Fundamental Rights to give to the people a sense of security and confidence. Then, it was thought necessary that people should have some Rights which may be enforced against the government which may become arbitary at times. Though democracy was being introduced in India, yet democratic traditions were lacking, and there was a danger that the majority in the legislature may enact laws which may be oppressive to individuals or minority groups, and such a danger could be minimised by having a Bill of Rights in the Constitution. The need to have the Fundamental Rights was so very well accepted on all hands that in the Constituent Assembly, the point was not even considered whether or not to incorporate such Rights in the Constitution. In fact, the fight all along was against the restrictions being imposed on them and the effort all along was to have the Fundamental Rights on as broad and pervasive a basis as possible.25 The Fundamental Rights are a necessary consequence of the declaration in the Preamble to the Constitution that the people of India have solemnly resolved to constitute India into a sovereign democratic republic and to secure to all its citizens justice, social, economic, and political; liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship; equality of status and opportunity.26 Part III of the Constitution protects substantive as well as procedural rights.27 The Fundamental Rights in India, apart from guaranteeing certain basic civil Rights and freedoms to all, also fulfil the important function of giving a few safeguards to minorities, outlawing discrimination and protecting religious freedom and cultural rights. During emergency, however, some curtailment of the Fundamental Rights does take place.28 But all these curtailments of Fundamental Rights are of a temporary nature. Fundamental Rights must not be read in isolation but along with directive principles and fundamental duties. Page 946 29 The Indian Constitution guarantees essential human rights in the form of Fundamental Rights under Part III and also directive principles of State policy in Part IV which are fundamental in the governance of the country. Freedoms granted under Part III have been liberally construed by various pronouncements of the Supreme Court in the last half a century, keeping in view the International Covenants to which India is a party. The object has been to place citizens at a centre stage and make the State accountable.30 Articles 12 to 35 of the Constitution pertain to Fundamental Rights of the people. These Rights are reminiscent of some of the provisions of the Bill of Rights in the U.S. Constitution but the former cover a much wider ground than the latter. Also, the U.S. Constitution declares the Fundamental Rights in broad and general terms. But as no right is absolute, the courts have, in course of time, spelled out some restrictions and limitations on these Rights. The Indian Constitution, however, adopts a different approach in so far as some Rights are worded generally; in respect of some Fundamental Rights, the exceptions and qualifications have been formulated and expressed in a compendious form in the Constitution itself, while in respect of some other Rights, the Constitution confers power on the Legislature to impose limitations. The result of this strategy has been that the constitutional provisions pertaining to Fundamental Rights have become rather detailed and complex.",

    "content": "framers of the Indian Constitution, learning from the experiences of the U.S.A., visualized a great many difficulties in enunciating the Fundamental Rights in general terms and in leaving it to the courts to enforce them, viz., the Legislature not being in a position to know what view the courts would take of a particular enactment, the process of legislation becomes difficult; there arises a vast mass of litigation about the validity of the laws and the judicial opinion is often changing so that law becomes uncertain; the judges are irremovable and are not elected; they are, therefore, not so sensitive to public needs in the social or economic sphere as the elected legislators and so a complete and unqualified veto over legislation could not be left in judicial hands.31 Even then, certain rights especially economic Rights, have had to be amended from time to time to save some economic programmes.32 The Fundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution have been grouped under seven heads as follows: (i) Right to Equality comprising Articles 14 to 18, of which Article 14 is the most important.33 (ii) Right to Freedom comprising Articles 19 to 22 which guarantee several freedoms, the most important of which is the freedom of speech.34 (iii) Right against Exploitation consists of Articles 23 and 24.35 (iv) Right to Freedom of Religion is guaranteed by Articles 25 to 28.36 (v) Cultural and Educational Rights are guaranteed by Articles 29 and 30.37 (vi) Right to Property is now very much diluted and is secured to some extent by Arts. 30-A, 31-A, 31-B and 31-C.38 (vii) Right to Constitutional Remedies is secured by Articles 32 to 35. These Articles provide the remedies to enforce the Fundamental Rights, and of these the most important is Art. 32.39 As the Fundamental Rights constitute by and large a limitation on the government, the most important problem which the courts have been faced with while interpreting these rights has been to achieve a proper balance between the rights of the individual and those of the state or the society as a whole, between individual liberty and social control. This is a very difficult as well as a delicate task indeed in these days of development of the country into a social welfare state. On the whole, however, one could say that in the area of non-economic matters, like freedom of speech or the right to life, the line has been shifting in favour of the individual, while in the area of economic matters, the line has been constantly shifting in favour of social control. This has been achieved both by judicial interpretation as well as constitutional amendments as the discussion in the following pages will amply depict. The Fundamental Rights guarantee certain economic rights. Too much emphasis on these rights might have led to the emergence of a laissez faire economy in India which is now an out of date concept. Accordingly, Page 947 partly by judicial interpretation, and partly by constitutional amendment process, emphasis has come to be laid on social control in economic matters leading to the emergence of a regulated economy. The right to property also has had a chequered history. Originally it was secured by Arts. 19(1)(f) and 31, and the courts were prone to give these provisions a broad perspective thus giving to property rights a better protection. But now the Fundamental Right to property has been very much diluted. This development has been discussed fully later.40 But, on the other hand, in the post 1977era, the most notable development has been that great emphasis has come to be laid on the right to life and personal liberty, i.e., the freedom of the person guaranteed by Art. 21. Art. 21 has been given a new dimension by judicial interpretation.41 In Maneka Gandhi,42 the landmark case which initiated the process of expansion of the scope of Art. 21, the Court has observed: \"The attempt of the Court should be to expand the reach and ambit of the Fundamental Rights rather than to attenuate their meaning and content by a process of judicial construction.\" The great metamorphosis that has occurred in the judicial view as regards Art. 21 can be appreciated if the restrictive view adopted by the Supreme Court in Gopalan43 is set against the expansive interpretation of Art. 21 in a series of cases beginning Maneka Gandhi in 1977. In a nutshell, it may be said that, on the whole, the Supreme Court has displayed judicial creativity of a high order in interpreting the Fundamental Rights, especially during the last two decades. Reference may be made in this connection inter alia to such landmark Supreme Court cases as Maneka Gandhi, Indra Sawhney,44Asiad cases.45 In Ajay Hasia,46 BHAGWATI, J., has observed: \"It must be remembered that the Fundamental Rights are constitutional guarantees given to the people of India and are not merely paper hopes or fleeting promises and so long as they find a place in the Constitution, they should not be allowed to be emasculated in their application by a narrow and constricted judicial interpretation\". The Supreme Court has even enunciated the doctrine of implied Fundamental Rights. The Court has asserted that in order to treat a right as Fundamental Right it is not necessary that it should be expressly stated in the Constitution as a Fundamental Right. Political, social and economic changes occurring in the country may entail the recognition of new rights and the law in its eternal youth grows to meet social demands.47 There is no rule that unless a right is expressly stated as a Fundamental Right it cannot be treated as one. Over time, the Supreme Court has been able to imply by its interpretative process, several Fundamental Rights, such as, freedom of press, right to privacy, out of the expressly stated Fundamental Rights. By and large, barring some exceptions, the Supreme Court has, on the whole, interpreted the Fundamental Rights in a liberal manner.",

    "content": "time, the Supreme Court has been able to imply by its interpretative process, several Fundamental Rights, such as, freedom of press, right to privacy, out of the expressly stated Fundamental Rights. By and large, barring some exceptions, the Supreme Court has, on the whole, interpreted the Fundamental Rights in a liberal manner. The Court has laid emphasis on this aspect from time to time. For instance, in Pathumma,48 the Court has stated that in interpreting the Constitution, \"the judicial approach should be dynamic rather than static, pragmatic and not pedantic and elastic rather than rigid.\" But the award of a sentence by the order of a Court cannot amount to violation of any of the Fundamental Rights.49 On the whole, the Supreme Court has displayed a liberal and creative attitude in interpretation of Fundamental Rights and this has had a profound influence on the development and delineation of the Fundamental Rights in course of time. This will become clear from the following discussion. The Fundamental Rights are not all distinct and mutually exclusive Rights. Each freedom has different dimensions and a law may have to meet the challenge under various Fundamental Rights. Thus, a law depriving a person of his personal liberty may have to stand the test of Arts. 14, 19 and 21 to be valid. Formerly, however, the courts had applied the doctrine of exclusivity of Fundamental Rights and treated each right as a distinct and separate entity,50 but this view has now undergone a change,51 thus, providing to the courts a better leverage to test the validity of laws affecting Fundamental Rights. Page 948 The Supreme Court plays a very significant role in relation to the Fundamental Rights. In the first place, the Court acts as the protector and the guardian of these rights. In the second place, the Court acts as the interpreter of the Fundamental Rights. The Supreme Court acts as the \"sentinel on the qui vive\" in relation to the Fundamental Rights. Commenting on its role entrusted to it under the Constitution to protect Fundamental Rights, the Supreme Court has observed in Daryao52: \"The Fundamental Rights are intended not only to protect individual's rights but they are based on high public policy. Liberty of the individual and the protection of his Fundamental Rights are the very essence of the democratic way of life adopted by the Constitution, and it is the privilege and the duty of this Court to uphold those rights. This Court would naturally refuse to circumscribe them or to curtail them except as provided by the Constitution itself.\" The Fundamental Rights play a noteworthy role in the area of the Indian Administrative Law. A phenomenon generally discernible today in practically every democracy is the vast growth in the functions, powers and activities of the Administration under the impact of the modern philosophy of 'welfare state'. A large amount of discretion is left in the hands of administrative authorities. An important problem of modern Administrative Law is to seek to strengthen the techniques to control the administration in the exercise of its various powers. Some of the Fundamental Rights like Arts. 14, 19, 22 and 31 have been used for this purpose. In a large number of cases, validity of laws conferring discretion on the Administration has been scrutinised with reference to the Fundamental Rights. For this purpose, both substantive as well as procedural parts of the law are taken into consideration.53 On the substantive side, the courts have taken objection in many cases to bestowal of arbitrary and unregulated discretion on the Administration. On the procedural side, laws conferring discretion without necessary procedural safeguards have been invalidated. In some cases, objection has been taken to the exercise of administrative discretion on the ground of its being discriminatory, or having been exercised without due procedure. The discussion in the following pages amply illustrates the several points mentioned here.54 C. JUSTICIABILITY OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS ART. 13 : Laws Inconsistent With Fundamental Rights Art. 13 is the key provision as it gives teeth to the Fundamental Rights and makes them justiciable. The effect of Art. 13 is that the Fundamental Rights cannot be infringed by the government either by enacting a law or through administrative action. Article 13(1) declares that all pre-Constitution laws shall be void to the extent of their inconsistency with the Fundamental Rights. Art. 13(1) deals with the pre-Constitution laws; if any such law is inconsistent with a Fundamental Right, it becomes void from 26-1-50, the date on which the Constitution of India came into force. According to Art. 13(2), the State 'shall not make any law' which takes away or abridges the Fundamental Rights; and a law contravening a Fundamental Right is, to the extent of the contravention, void. Article 13(2) is the crucial constitutional provision which deals with the post-Constitution laws. If any such law violates any Fundamental Right it becomes void ab initio, i.e., from its inception. The effect of Art. 13(2) thus is that no Fundamental Right can be infringed by the state either by legislative or administrative action. Article 13 makes the judiciary, and especially the Apex Court, as the guardian, protector and the interpreter of the Fundamental Rights.55 It is the function of the courts to assess individual laws vis-à-vis the Fundamental Rights so as to ensure that no law infringes a Fundamental Right. The courts perform the arduous task of declaring a law unconstitutional if it infringes a Fundamental Right. It is the function of the courts to ensure that no statute violates a Fundamental Right. This is the exercise of its protective role by the judiciary, i.e., protecting the Fundamental Rights from being violated by a statute. A statute is declared unconstitutional and void if it comes in conflict with a Fundamental Right. Article 13 confers a power as well as imposes an obligation on the courts to declare a law void if it is Page 949 inconsistent with a Fundamental Right. This is a power of great consequence for the courts.",

This is a power of great consequence for the courts. The Supreme Court has figuratively characterised this role of the courts as that of a \"sentinel on the qui vive.56 It may however be underlined that the courts do not lightly declare a statue unconstitutional because they are conscious of their responsibility in declaring a law made by a democratic legislature void. On the whole, not many statutes have been hit by Fundamental Rights. However, judicial review of administrative action is some what more pervasive than that of legislative action. The expansive purview of Art. 21 and other Articles, as stated above, affects administrative action very deeply as will be clear by the later discussion. The principles of Judicial Review of legislation and interpretation of the Constitution are fully discussed in a later Chapter.57 The Supreme Court has further bolstered its protective role under Art. 13(2) by laying down the proposition that judicial review is the 'basic' feature of the Constitution.58 This means that the power of judicial review cannot be curtailed or evaded by any future Constitutional amendment. Protection of the institution of judicial review is crucially interconnected with the protection of Fundamental Rights, for depriving the Supreme Court and other Courts of their power of judicial review would mean that the Fundamental Rights become non-enforceable, \"a mere adornment\", as they will become rights without remedy. This idea has been conveyed by CHANDRACHUD, C.J., as follows in Minerva Mills:59 \"It is the function of the Judges, nay their duty, to pronounce upon the validity of laws. If courts are totally deprived of that power, the fundamental rights conferred on the people will become a mere adornment because rights conferred on the people will become a mere adornment because rights without remedies are as writ in water. A controlled constitution will then become uncontrolled.\" As KHANNA, J., has emphasized in Kesavananda:60 \"As long as some Fundamental Rights exist and are a part of the Constitution, the power of judicial review has also to be exercised with a view to see that the guarantees afforded by those rights are not contravened...Judicial review has thus become an integral part of our constitutional system\". AHMADI, C.J., speaking on behalf of a bench of seven Judges in L. Chandra Kumar v. India, 61 has observed: \"The Judges of the Superior Court have been entrusted with the task of upholding the Constitution and to this end, have been conferred the power to interpret it. It is they who have to ensure that the balance of power envisaged by the Constitution is maintained and that the legislature and the executive do not, in the discharge of their functions, transgress constitutional limitations...We, therefore, hold that the power of judicial review over legislative action vested in the High Courts under Art. 22662 and in this Court under Art. 3263 of the Constitution is an integral and essential feature of the Constitution, constituting part of its basic structure. Ordinarily, therefore, the power of the High Courts and the Supreme Court to test the constitutional validity of legislation can never be ousted or excluded.\" Accordingly, in the instant case, the Supreme Court has declared unconstitutional clause 2(d) of Art. 323A and clause 3(d) of Art. 323B, to the extent they sought to exclude jurisdiction of the High Courts and the Supreme Court conferred under Arts. 226, 227 and 32. The Court has observed in this connection: \"The jurisdiction conferred on the High Courts under Arts. 226/ 227 and upon the Supreme Court under Art. 32 of the Constitution is part of the inviolable basic structure of our Constitution. While this jurisdiction cannot be ousted, other Courts and Tribunals may perform a supplemental role in discharging the powers conferred by Articles 226/ 227 and 32 of the Constitution.\"64 It may be appreciated that declaration of Fundamental Rights in the Constitution cannot be of much avail if no machinery is provided for their enforcement. The Constitution confers this protective role on the Supreme Court and the High Courts. These Courts can issue various writs, orders and directions for the enforcement of these Fundamental Rights by virtue of Arts. 32 and 226.65 It may be interesting to know that the U.S. Constitution does not specifically provide for judicial review. But, Page 950 as early as 1803, in the famous case of Marbury v. Madison, 66 the Supreme Court asserted that it would review the constitutionality of the Congressional Acts. MARSHALL, C.J., expounded the theory of judicial review of the constitutionality of Acts of Congress as follows: \"It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. Those who apply the rule to particular cases must of necessity expound and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the Courts must decide on the operation of each. So if a law be in opposition to the Constitution; if both the law and the Constitution apply to a particular case, so that the Court must either decide that case conformably to the law, disregarding the constitution; or conformably to the constitution, disregarding the law, the Court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case. This is of the very essence of judicial duty.\" Article 13 deals with statute law and not with the law declared by the courts, or with the directions or orders made by the Supreme Court under Art. 142.67 D. STATE Most of the Fundamental Rights are claimed against the state and its instrumentalities and not against private bodies.68 Art. 13(2), as stated above, bars the 'state' from making any 'law' infringing a Fundamental Right. The two important concepts used in this provision, are : 'state' and 'law'. These concepts need some elucidation. Fundamental Rights are claimed mostly against the 'state'. Article 12 gives an extended significance to the term 'state'. Art.",

    "content": "D. STATE Most of the Fundamental Rights are claimed against the state and its instrumentalities and not against private bodies.68 Art. 13(2), as stated above, bars the 'state' from making any 'law' infringing a Fundamental Right. The two important concepts used in this provision, are : 'state' and 'law'. These concepts need some elucidation. Fundamental Rights are claimed mostly against the 'state'. Article 12 gives an extended significance to the term 'state'. Art. 12 clarifies that the term 'state' occurring in Art. 13(2), or any other provision concerning Fundamental Rights, has an expansive meaning. According to Art. 12, the term 'state' includes-- (i) the Government and Parliament of India: (ii) the Government and the Legislature of a State; (iii) all local authorities; and (iv) other authorities within the territory of India, or under the control of the Central Government. The actions of any of the bodies comprised within the term 'state' as defined in Art. 12 can be challenged before the courts under Art. 13(2) on the ground of violating Fundamental Rights. The most significant expression used in Art. 12 is \"other authorities\". [See (iv) above]. This expression is not defined in the Constitution. It is, therefore, for the Supreme Court, as the Apex Court, to define this term. It is obvious that wider the meaning attributed to the term \"other authorities\" in Art. 12, wider will be the coverage of the Fundamental Rights, i.e., more and more bodies can be brought within the discipline of the Fundamental Rights. (a) OTHER AUTHORITIES The interpretation of the term 'other authorities' in Art. 12 has caused a good deal of difficulty, and judicial opinion has undergone changes over time. Today's government performs a large number of functions because of the prevailing philosophy of a social welfare state.69 The government acts through natural persons as well as juridical persons. Some functions are discharged through the traditional governmental departments and officials while some functions are discharged through autonomous bodies existing outside the departmental structure, such as, companies, corporations etc. While the government acting departmentally, or through officials, undoubtedly, falls within the definition of 'state' under Art. 12,70 doubts have been cast as regards the character of autonomous bodies. Whether they could be regarded as 'authorities' under Art. 12 and, thus, be subject to Fundamental Rights? Page 951 An autonomous body may be a statutory body, i.e., a body set up directly by a statute, or it may be a non-statutory body, i.e., a body registered under a general law, such as, the Companies Act, the Societies Registration Act, or a State Co-operative Societies Act,etc. Questions have been raised whether such bodies may be included within the coverage of Art. 12. For this purpose, the Supreme Court has developed the concept of an \"instrumentality\" of the state. Any body which can be regarded as an \"instrumentality\" of the state falls under Art. 12. The reason for adopting such a broad view of Art. 12 is that the Constitution should, whenever possible, \"be so construed as to apply to arbitrary application of power against individuals by centres of power. The emerging principle appears to be that a public corporation being a creation of the state is subject to the Constitutional limitation as the state itself\".71 Further that \"the governing power wherever located must be subject to the fundamental constitutional limitations\".72 In Rajasthan State Electricity Board v. Mohanlal, 73 the Supreme Court ruled that a State electricity board, set up by a statute, having some commercial functions to discharge, would be an 'authority' under Art. 12. The Court emphasized that it is not material that some of the powers conferred on the concerned authority are of commercial nature. This is because under Art. 298,74the government is empowered to carry on any trade or commerce. Thus, the Court observed: \"The circumstance that the Board under the Electricity Supply Act is required to carry on some activities of the nature of trade or commerce does not, therefore give any indication that the 'Board' must be excluded from the scope of the word 'state' is used in Art. 12.\" In Sukhdev v. Bhagatram, 75 three statutory bodies, viz., Life Insurance Corporation, Oil and Natural Gas Commission and the Finance Corporation, were held to be \"authorities\" and, thus, fall within the term 'state' in Art. 12. These corporations do have independent personalities in the eyes of the law, but that does not mean that \"they are not subject to the control of the government or that they are not instrumentalities of the government\".76 The question was considered more thoroughly in Ramanna D. Shetty v. International Airport Authority, 77 The International Airport Authority, a statutory body, was held to be an 'authority'. The Supreme Court also developed the general proposition that an 'instrumentality' or 'agency' of the government would be regarded as an 'authority' or 'State' within Art. 12 and laid down some tests to determine whether a body could be regarded as an instrumentality or not. Where a corporation is an instrumentality or agency of the government, it would be subject to the same constitutional or public law limitation as the government itself. In this case, the Court was enforcing the mandate of Art. 14 against the Corporation.78 By now though the question of statutory bodies had been settled, as stated above, yet that of the non-statutory bodies, still continued to cause confusion and difficulty. In several cases hitherto, a government company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act had been held to be not an 'authority' under Art. 12.79 In Sabhaji Tewary v. India, 80 a case decided after Sukhdev, the Supreme Courtruled that the Indian Council of Scientific Research, a body registered under the Societies Registration Act (thus a non-statutory body), but under a good deal of governmental control and funding, was not a 'state'. There were judicial observations in Sukhdev to the effect that even a non-statutory body could be treated as an 'authority' if it could be regarded as an instrumentality or agency of the government.",

    "content": "were judicial observations in Sukhdev to the effect that even a non-statutory body could be treated as an 'authority' if it could be regarded as an instrumentality or agency of the government. But these observations did not affect the judicial thinking in Sabhajit.81 Again, the Supreme Court made observations in Raman suggesting that a non-statutory body could be regarded as an 'authority' if it could be regarded as an instrumentality of the government, but the actual body involved there was statutory in nature. Burmah Shell was nationalised and vested in the Government itself under the Burmah Shell (Acquisition of Undertakings in India) Act, 1976. The Act provided that the undertaking would be vested in a government company. Accordingly, the undertaking was taken over by the Bharat Petroleum Corporation, a government company registered under the Indian Companies Act. The question was whether Bharat Petroleum--which was neither a government department nor a statutory body but merely a company--could be regarded as an \"authority\" and so \"state\" under Art. 12. Page 952 In Som Prakash v. Union of India, 82 the company was held to fall under Art. 12. The Court emphasized that the true test for the purpose whether a body was an 'authority' or not was not whether it was formed by a statute, or under a statute, but it was \"functional\". In the instant case, the key factor was \"the brooding presence of the state behind the operations of the body, statutory or other\". In this case, the body was semi-statutory and semi-non-statutory. It was non-statutory in origin (as it was registered); it also was recognised by the Act in question and, thus, had some \"statutory flavour\" in its operations and functions. In this case, there was a formal transfer of the undertaking from the Government to a government company. The company was thus regarded as the \"alter ego\" of the Central Government. The control by the Government over the corporation was writ large in the Act and in the factum of being a government company. Agency of a State would mean a body which exercises public functions.83 The question regarding the status of a non-statutory body was finally clinched in Ajay Hasia,84where a society registered under the Societies Registration Act running the regional engineering college, sponsored, supervised and financially supported by the Government, was held to be an 'authority'. Money to run the college was provided by the State and Central Governments. The State Government could review the functioning of the college and issue suitable instructions if considered necessary. Nominees of the State and Central Governments were members of the society including its Chairman. TheSupreme Court ruled that where a corporation is an instrumentality or agency of the government, it must be held to be an authority under Art. 12. \"The concept of instrumentality or agency of the government is not limited to a corporation created by a statute but is equally applicable to a company or society....\" Thus, a registered society was held to be an 'authority' for the purposes of Art. 12. Ajay Hasia has initiated a new judicial trend, viz., that of expanding the significance of the term \"authority\". In Ajay Hasia, The Supreme Court laid down the following tests to adjudge whether a body is an instrumentality of the government or not: (1) If the entire share capital of the body is held by the government, it goes a long way towards indicating that the body is an instrumentality of the government. (2) Where the financial assistance given by the government is so large as to meet almost entire expenditure of the body, it may indicate that the body is impregnated with governmental character. (3) It is a relevant factor if the body enjoys monopoly status which is conferred or protected by the state. (4) Existence of deep and pervasive state control may afford an indication that the body is a state instrumentality. (5) If the functions performed by the body are of public importance and closely related to governmental functions, it is a relevant factor to treat the body as an instrumentality of the government. The important question is not how the juristic person is born, but why has it been brought into existence? It does not matter what is the structure of the body in question: it may be statutory or non-statutory; it may be set up by, or under, an Act of the Legislature or even administratively. It does not matter whether the body in question has been set up initially by the government or by private enterprise. It does not matter what functions does the body discharge; it may be governmental, semi-governmental, educational, commercial, banking, social service. The Supreme Court has pointed out that even if it may be assumed that one or the other test as provided in the case of Ajay Hasia may be attracted, that by itself would not be sufficient to hold that it is an agency of the State or a company carrying on the functions of public nature.85 In view of the several views and tests suggested by Supreme Court it is not possible to make a close ended category of bodies which would be considered to be a state within the meaning of Art.12. The question in each case will have to be considered on the basis of facts available as to whether in the light of the cumulative facts as established, the body is financially, functionally, administratively dominated, by, or under the control of the Government. Such control must be particular to the body in question and must be pervasive. Mere regulatory control whether under statute or otherwise would not serve to make a body a part of the State.",

    "content": "when the facts revealed : Page 953 (1) The Board of Control of Cricket in India was not created by a statute; (2) No part of the share capital of the Board was held by the Government; (3) Practically no financial assistance was given by the Government to meet the whole or entire expenditure of the Board; (4) The Board did enjoy a monopoly status in the field of cricket but such status is not State conferred or State protected. (5) There was no existence of a deep and pervasive State control and the control, if any, is only regulatory in nature as applicable to other similar bodies. (6) The Board was not created by transfer of a government owned corporation and was an autonomous body. The Court noted that the Union of India has been exercising certain control over the activities of the Board in regard to organizing cricket matches and travel of the Indian team abroad as also granting of permission to allow the foreign teams to come to India. The Court also assumed that even if there was some element of public duty involved in the discharge of the Board's functions the Board would not be an authority for the purpose of Article 12. In the absence of any authorization, if a private body chooses to discharge any functions or duties which amount to public duties or State functions which is not prohibited by law then it may be considered to be an instrumentality of the State.86 In S. C. Chandra87 the Supreme Court came dangerously close to creating a confusion in relation to the concepts of instrumentality of the State. The judgment in this case was a common one and involved, amongst others Bharat Coking Coal Limited. Without any discussion whatsoever the Court appears to have approved the view taken by Division Bench of the Jharkhand High Court that BCCL was \"not an instrumentality of the State as per Section 617 of the Companies Act as its dominant function was to raise coal and sale and imparting education was not its dominant function.\". The question which arose for decision was whether the teachers of a school not owned by BCCL and was run by a Managing Committee and whose teachers were never appointed by BCCL, although BCCL used to release non-recurring grants subject to certain conditions would result in such teachers to be considered as the employees of BCCL and entitled to all benefits available to the regular employees of BCCL. In this factual background it is not understandable as to how the question of BCCL being an instrumentality of the State could be of any relevance either before the Division Bench of the High Court or the Supreme Court. Since the school was not owned or managed by BCCL and not even entirely dependent upon financial aid from BCCL it could not have been considered to be an instrumentality of the State. \"Dominant function\" test was applied in a situation where there was no function which the BCCL was obliged to discharge. This case cannot be an authority for the proposition that BCCL is not an instrumentality of the state. The Courts have been led to take such an expansive view of Art. 12 because of the feeling that if instrumentalities of the government are not subjected to the same legal discipline as the government itself because of the plea that they were distinct and autonomous legal entities, then the government would be tempted to adopt the stratagem of setting up such administrative structures on a big scale in order to evade the discipline and constraints of the Fundamental Rights thus eroding and negating their efficacy to a very large extent. In this process, judicial control over these bodies would be very much weakened.88 The law appears to be now settled in view of the judgment of a seven Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in Pradeep Kumar Biswas89 where, after considering the authorities it concluded that the tests formulated in Ajay Hasia90 were not a rigid set of principles so that if a body falls within any of those tests, ex hypothesi, it must be considered to be a State within the meaning of Article 12. The Court suggested a general guideline observing: \"The question in each case would be whether in the light of the cumulative facts as established, the body is financially, functionally and administratively dominated by or under the control of the Government. Such control must be particular to the body in question and must be pervasive. If this is found then the body is a State within Article 12. On the other Page 954 hand, when the control is merely regulatory whether under statute or otherwise, it would not serve to make the body a State.\" The main tests which the courts apply to determine whether a body is an instrumentality of the government or not are: funding and control. Is the entire share capital or a major part of it held by the government? Is the body in question effectively controlled by the government not only in the making of its policy but also in carrying out its functions? Does the government foot a substantial part of the bill for running the operations of the concerned body? Is the administration of the body in the hands of the government-appointed directors and are they subject to government control in the discharge of their functions? Does the state exercise deep and pervasive control over the body in question? Whether the operation of the corporation is an important public function closely related to governmental functions? Does the body enjoy monopoly status conferred or protected by the state? The above tests are not exhaustive but only indicative or illustrative. It is for the courts to decide in each case whether the body in question falls within the purview of Art. 12.",

The above tests are not exhaustive but only indicative or illustrative. It is for the courts to decide in each case whether the body in question falls within the purview of Art. 12. A company enjoying the monopoly of carrying on a business under an Act of Legislature has the \"trappings\" of \"state\" and is an \"authority\" under Art. 12.91 Once a body is characterised as an 'authority' under Art. 12, several significant incidents invariably follow, viz.: (1) The body becomes subject to the discipline of the Fundamental Rights which means that its actions and decisions can be challenged with reference to the Fundamental Rights. (2) The body also becomes subject to the discipline of Administrative Law. (3) The body becomes subject to the writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Art. 32 and that of the High Courts under Art. 226. In course of time, the Supreme Court has been expanding the horizon of the term \"other authority\" in Art. 12. A large number of bodies, statutory1 and non-statutory,2 have been held to be 'authorities' for purposes of Art. 12. For example, the Supreme Courthas held the Statistical Institute as an authority. It is a registered society but is governed by the Indian Statistical Institute Act, 1959. The composition of the body is dominated by the representatives appointed by the Central Government. The money required for running the Institute is provided entirely by the Central Government. It has to comply with all the directions issued by the Central Government. \"The control of the Central Government is deep and pervasive and, therefore, to all intents and purposes, it is an instrumentality of the Central Government and as such is an 'authority' within the meaning of Art. 12 of the Constitution\".3 The Indian Council of Agricultural Research came into existence as a department of the government, continued to be an attached office of the government even though it was registered as a society, it was wholly financed by the government. The ICAR was accordingly held to be an 'authority' under Art. 12 as it was a society set up by the state.4 A cooperative society is not a State within Art. 12 unless the tests indicated in Ajay Hasia,5 are satisfied.6 Cooperative societies cannot be, without examination of relevant factual aspects, equated with public sector undertakings.7 In Central Inland Water Transport Corporation v. Brojo Nath, 8 the corporation, a government company incorporated under the Companies Act, has been held to be an authority, and so the 'state' within the meaning of Art. 12. The Supreme Court has laid down the following significant principle in this regard: \"If there is an instrumentality or agency of the state which has assumed the garb of a government company as defined in S. Section 617 of the Companies Act, it does not follow that it thereby ceases to be an instrumentality or agency of the state. For the purposes of Art. 12, one must necessarily see through the corporate veil to ascertain whether behind that veil is the face of an instrumentality or agency of the state\". Mysore Paper Mills, a government company, has been held to be an instrumentality of the State Government and, hence, an authority under Art. 12.9 More than 97% of the share capital of the company has been contributed by the State Government and the financial institutions of the Central Government, Out of 12 directors, 5 are government nominees and the rest are approved by the Government; the company has been Page 955 entrusted with important public duties and the Government exercises various other forms of supervision over the company. The company is an instrumentality of the Government and its physical form of a company \"is merely a cloak or cover for the Government.\" Any doubt as to whether a writ petition under Art. 226 would lie against state corporation has been set at rest by the declaration of the Supreme Court.10 Not only a body sponsored or created by the government may be treated as an 'authority', but even a private body (one sponsored and formed by private persons) may be so treated if--(i) it is supported by extraordinary assistance given by the state, or (ii) if the state funding is not very large, state financial support coupled with an unusual degree of control over its management and policies may lead to the same result. The various tests laid down in Ajay Hasia case would have to be applied and considered cumulatively.11 Applying Ajay Hasia tests (i) to (iv) it has been held that the appellant Mill was neither an instrumentality nor an agency of the Government and was not an \"other authority\". The Cochin Refineries Ltd. incorporated under the Companies Act has been held to be not an 'authority' because only 53 per cent of its share capital has been subscribed by the Central Government; 26 per cent share is held by a private foreign company which also nominates two directors on the board of directors; government control over the company is not large; government's financial assistance is not unusual.12 And a general regulation under a statute does not render activities of the body so regulated as subject to such control of the State as to bring it within the meaning of State under Art. 12.13 Some non-statutory bodies which have been held to be 'authorities' within the meaning of Art. 12 are: 1. The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations--a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, and imparting education and holding examinations.14 2. An aided school receiving 95% of its expenses by way of government grant and subject to regulations made by the department of education though managed by a registered body.15 3.",

The Indian Council of Agricultural Research, a society registered under the Societies Registration Act.16 4. Even if the entire share capital of a company is subscribed by the government, it cannot yet be treated as a government department. The company has its own corporate personality distinct from the government. Such a government company can still be treated as an authority under Art. 12.17 Government companies, such as, Bharat Earth Movers Ltd., Indian Telephone Industries Ltd., in which the Government holds 51% share capital, and which are subject to pervasive government control, have been held to be \"other authorities\" under Art. 12.18 5. The regional rural banks set up in pursuance of the power given by a statute. A regional bank is wholly funded by a nationalised bank, Central Government and the State Government. It is sponsored by a nationalised bank; it is under the pervasive control of the Central Government and it discharges functions analogous to those discharged by a welfare state.19 6. The Sainik School Society registered under the Societies Registration Act. The society establishes and manages Sainik schools. A Sainik school is fully funded by the Central and State Governments and the Central Government exercises over-all control over the society.20 7. The State Financial Corporationconstituted under the State Financial Corporation Act, 1951 has been held to be state within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution and was required to act fairly, reasonably in accordance with the statutory and constitutional scheme including Article 14.21 8. The Children's Aid Society, a registered body under the Societies Registration Act, having the Chief Minister of Maharashtra as theex-officio President and the Minister of Social Welfare as its Vice-President.22 9. National Agricultural Cooperative Federation of India (NAFED).23 10. Delhi Stock Exchange is covered by definition of State under Art. 12 and amenable to writ jurisdiction of High Court.24 11. Projects and Equipment Corp. of India, a subsidiary owned by the State Trading Corporation which is also a non-statutory body.25 12. U.P. State Co-operative Land Development Bank Ltd. is a cooperative society but it is under pervasive control of the State Government and is an extended arm of the Government. It is thus an instrumentality of the State.26 Page 956 In Sabhajit Tewary,27 the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) was held to be not an \"authority\" under Art. 12. Now, the Supreme Court has overruled Tewary holding it to be erroneous. CSIR has now been held to be an \"authority\" under Art. 12.28 Punjab Water Supply & Sewerage Board is an autonomous body and the statute which incorporates it provides that any direction issued by the State shall be binding on it and brings it within the concept of State in Art. 12 and are bound to comply with the Constitutional scheme of equality enshrined in Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.29 In this expansive trend, there have been some discordant notes as well. One such example is furnished by Tekraj v. Union of India, 30 where the Supreme Court has held the Institute of Constitutional and Parliamentary Studies as not being an 'authority' under Art. 12. The Institute is a registered society receiving grants from the Central Government and having the President of India, Vice-President and the Prime Minister among its honorary members. The Central Government exercises a good deal of control over the Institute. In spite of Government funding and control, the Court has refused to hold it as an authority with the remark: \"..................... ICPS is a case of its type--typical in many ways and the normal tests may perhaps not properly apply to test its character.\" On the same basis, National Council of Educational Research and Training has been held to be outside the scope of Art. 12. NCERT is a society registered under the Societies Registration Act. It is largely an autonomous body; its activities are not wholly related to governmental functions; government control is confined mostly to ensuring that its funds are property utilised; its funding is not entirely from government sources.31 A private educational institution, even if it is recognised by, or affiliated to, a university, cannot be regarded as an instrumentality of the government for purposes of Art. 12. Recognition is only for the purposes of conforming to the standards laid down by the State. Affiliation is with regard to the syllabi and the courses of study.32 The expanding connotation being given to the term 'authority' in Art. 12 is an instance of judicial creativity. The courts have adopted this stance to bring as many bodies as possible within the discipline of Fundamental Rights. Wider the concept of 'other authority' wider the coverage of Fundamental Rights. The courts have been able to bring within the sweep of Fundamental Rights every instrumentality or agency through which the government acts. Almost all government activities have been subjected to the obligation of Fundamental Rights. BHAGWATI, J., in his opinion in Ajay Hasia33 provided the rationale for expansively interpreting the term \"authority\" in Art. 12.",

    "content": "modern government functions, under the impulse of the philosophy of a welfare state, on a very broad scale: it undertakes a multitude of socio-economic functions.34 For the sake of convenience, the government not always departmentally but also through various types of bodies, such as, a company, co-operative society, corporation etc., \"but this contrivance of carrying on such activities through a corporation cannot exonerate the government from implicit obedience to the Fundamental Rights.\" BHAGWATI, J., went on to observe: \"To use the corporate methodology is not to liberate the government from its basic obligation to respect the Fundamental Rights and not to override them. The mantle of a corporation may be adopted in order to free the Government from the inevitable constraints of red-tapism and slow motion but by doing so, the Government cannot be allowed to play truant with the basic human rights. Otherwise it would be the easiest thing for the Government to assign to a plurality of corporations almost every state business, such as, Post and Telegraph, T.V. and Radio, Rail Road and Telephones--in short every economic activity and thereby cheat the people of India out of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed to them.\"35 BHAGWATI, J., maintained: \"The courts should be anxious to enlarge the scope and width of the Fundamental Rights by bringing within their sweep every authority which is an instrumentality or agency of the government or through the corporate personality of which Page 957 the government is acting...\" Thus, in giving an expansive interpretation to the term \"other authority\" in Art. 12, the Supreme Court is discharging its protective role, i.e., to protect the Fundamental Rights from being annihilated by the Government resorting to the expedient of setting up various bodies, outside government departments, to discharge its manifold functions. A Fundamental Right can be enforced against an authority when it is within the Indian territory, or it is under the control of the Government of India though outside the Indian territory. In the latter case, a writ would be issued to the Government of India which can have it executed by the concerned authority by exercising its power of control over it. A quasi-judicial authority is not subject to the control of the government in the functional sense, and, therefore, no order can be passed against the government for enforcement of a Fundamental Right by a quasi-judicial body functioning outside India.36 As the Supreme Court has stated, the mere fact that the authority is appointed and is subject to the disciplinary action by the government, is not determinative of the question of control. What is necessary is a control of functions of the authority; the government should be in a position to give directions to the authority \"to function in a particular manner with respect to such function\". The government can exercise such control over an administrative or executive body but not on a quasi-judicial body. The government could not direct a quasi-judicial body to act in a particular matter before it in a particular manner. It therefore resolves to this that no Fundamental Right can be claimed against a quasi-judicial body functioning outside the Indian territory. Another example of the expansive interpretation of the expression \"other authorities\" in Art. 12 is furnished by the recent decision of the Supreme Court in Pradeep Kumar Biswas v. Indian Institute of Chemical Biology .37 In this case, the Supreme Court has overruled Sabhajit Tewary38 and has held that the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) is an authority under Art. 12 and was bound by Art. 14.39 The Court has ruled that \"the control of the Government in CSIR is ubiquitous\". The Court has now laid down the following proposition for identification of \"authorities\" within Art. 12: \"The question in each case would be--whether in the light of the cumulative facts as established, the body is financially, functionally and administratively dominated by or under the control of the government. Such control must be particular to the body in question and must be pervasive. If this is found then the body is a state within Art. 12. On the other hand, when the control is merely regulatory whether under statute or otherwise, it would not serve to make the body a state\".40 Even though a body, entity or corporation is held to be \"State\" within the definition of Article 12 of the Constitution, what relief is to be granted to the aggrieved person or employee of such a body or entity is a subject matter in each case for the Court to determine on the basis of the structure of that society and also its financial capability and viability.41 Bombay Port Trust is an instrumentality of the State and hence an \"authority\" within the meaning of Article 12 and amenable to writ jurisdiction of the Court.42 The multiple test as laid down by the majority view in Pradip Biswas is to be applied for ascertaining whether a body is a State within the meaning of Art. 12.43 (b) LOCAL AUTHORITY The expression 'local authority' in Art. 12 refers to a unit of local self-government like a municipal committee or a village panchayat.44 The Delhi Development Authority, a statutory body, has been held to be a 'local authority' because it is constituted for the specific purpose of development of Delhi according to plan which is ordinarily a municipal Page 958 function.45 The activities of the D.D.A. are limited to Delhi. It has some element of popular representation in its composition and enjoys a considerable degree of autonomy. In the instant case, reference was made to the definition of \"local authority\" given in S.",

    "content": "the General Clauses Act which runs as follows: \"'Local authority' shall mean a municipal committee, district board, body of port commissioners or other authority legally entitled to, or entrusted by the Government with, the control or management of a municipal or local fund.\" The Supreme Court has ruled that to be characterised as a 'local authority', the authority concerned must have separate legal existence as a corporate body, it must not be a mere government agency but must be legally an independent entity; it must function in a defined area and must ordinarily, wholly or partly, directly or indirectly, be elected by the inhabitants of the area. It must also enjoy a certain degree of autonomy either complete or partial, must be entrusted by statute with such governmental functions and duties as are usually entrusted to municipal bodies such as those connected with providing amenities to the inhabitants of the locality like health and education, water and sewerage, town planning and development roads, markets, transportation, social welfare services, etc. Finally, such a body must have the power to raise funds for furtherance of its activities and fulfillment of its objectives by levying taxes, rates, charges or fees. In Calcutta State Transport Corporation v. Commr. of Income-tax, West Bengal, 46 the Supreme Court refused to characterise the Corporation as a 'local authority'. The corporation is meant only for the purpose of providing road transport services and has no element of popular representation in its constitution. Its powers and functions bear no relation to the powers and functions of a municipal committee. It is more in the nature of a trading corporation. A Fundamental Right is not infringed by a judicial order and no action, therefore, lies against a Court or judge on the ground of breach of a Fundamental Right,47 the reason being that what a judicial decision purports to do is to decide the controversy between the parties brought before the court. Even a quasi-judicial body acting within its jurisdiction under a valid law does not infringe a Fundamental Right merely by misinterpreting a law.48 But if a quasi-judicial body acts under an ultra vires law, or outside its jurisdiction, or ignores mandatory rules of procedure prescribed in the relevant law, or infringes principles of natural justice, and thereby affects a Fundamental right then its action can be quashed by the courts.49 IBA and Banks which were created under respective Parliamentary Acts or nationalized in terms of the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Acts, 1970 and 1980 were \"State\" within meaning of Art. 12.50 Without expressing any opinion on the question as to whether a cooperative society is a \"State\" within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court has held that a writ petition will be maintainable when the action of the cooperative society is violative of mandatory statutory provisions by which it is governed.51 E. LAW Another term used in Art. 13(2) is 'law'.52 The basic norm contained in Art. 13(2) is that any 'law' inconsistent with a Fundamental Right is void. The term 'law' in Art. 13 has been given a wide connotation so as to include any ordinance, order, bye-law, rule, regulation, notification, custom or usage having in the territory of India the force of law [ Art. 13(3)(a)]. This means that, not only a piece of legislation, but any of the things mentioned here can be challenged as infringing a Fundamental Right. Accordingly, inter alia the following have been held to be 'law' under Art. 13, the validity of which can be tested on the touchstone of Fundamental Rights: (i) a resolution passed by a State Government under Fundamental Rule 44 of the State;53 Page 959 (ii) a government notification under the Commissions of Inquiry Act setting up a commission of inquiry;54 (iii) a notification55 or an order56 under a statute; (iv) an administrative order;57 but administrative instruction is not law within the meaning of Article 13.58 (v) a custom or usage;59 (vi) bye-laws of a municipal or a statutory body;60 (vii) regulations made by a statutory corporation like the Life Insurance Corporation.61 The validity of the above can be questioned under the Fundamental Rights. The bye-laws of a co-operative society framed under the Co-operative Societies Act do not fall within the purview of Art. 13.62 Parliament, while making an Act cannot be deemed to have taken into consideration an earlier law found to be in contravention of Art. 13.63 Though a law as such may not be invalid, yet an order made under it can still be challenged as being inconsistent with a Fundamental Right because no law can be presumed to authorise anything unconstitutional.64 A question of great importance which has been debated in India from time to time is whether the term 'law' in Art. 13(1) would include an Act passed by Parliament to amend the Constitution. The question has been discussed fully at a later stage in this book.65 One point needs to be emphasized. A restriction on a Fundamental Right can be imposed only through a statute, statutory rule or statutory regulation. A Fundamental Right cannot be put under restraint merely by an administrative direction not having the force of law.66 (a) PERSONAL LAWS There prevail in India several personal laws, such as, Hindu Law, Muslim Law, Parsi Law, Christan Law of marriage and divorce. These are by and large non-statutory, traditional systems of law having some affinity with the concerned religion. Being ancient systems of law, there are several aspects of these systems of laws which are out of time with the modern thinking and may even be incompatible with some Fundamental Rights. From time to time, several features of these laws have been challenged before the courts on the ground of their incompatibility with the Fundamental Rights. By and large, in such cases, the courts have adopted an equivocal attitude. The courts have adopted the policy of non-interference keeping in view the susceptibilities of the groups to which these laws apply.",

    "content": "ancient systems of law, there are several aspects of these systems of laws which are out of time with the modern thinking and may even be incompatible with some Fundamental Rights. From time to time, several features of these laws have been challenged before the courts on the ground of their incompatibility with the Fundamental Rights. By and large, in such cases, the courts have adopted an equivocal attitude. The courts have adopted the policy of non-interference keeping in view the susceptibilities of the groups to which these laws apply. For this purpose, the courts have adopted two strategies. One, in some cases the courts have ruled that the challenged features of personal laws are not incompatible with the Fundamental Rights. Reference to this aspect is made in the course of the following discussion on specific Fundamental Rights, especially, under Arts. 14, 15, 25 and 26. Two, the courts have denied that the personal laws fall within the coverage of Art. 13 and, thus, these laws cannot be challenged under the Fundamental Rights. For instance, GAJENDRAGADKAR, J., observed in State of Bombay v. Narasu Appa Mali :67 \".......... the framers of the Constitution wanted to leave the personal laws outside the ambit of Part III of the Constitution (viz., Fundamental Rights). They must have been aware that these personal laws needed to the reformed in many material particulars and in fact they wanted to abolish these different personal laws and to evolve one common code. Yet they did not wish that the provisions of the personal laws should be challenged by reason of the Fundamental Rights.... and so they did not intend to include these personal laws within the definition of the expression \"laws in force\". Page 960 The view expressed by the Bombay High Court in Narasu has been reiterated in several cases by the High Courts68 and the Supreme Court.69 For example, in Ahmedabad Women Action Group v. Union of India, 70 a public interest litigation was filed through a writ petition to declare the Muslim Personal Law which allows polygamy as void as offending Arts. 14 and 15.71 The Supreme Court refused to take congnisance of the matter. The Court observed that the issues raised involve questions of state policy with which the Court does not ordinarily have any concern. The remedy lies somewhere else (meaning the Legislature) rather than the courts. In P.E. Mathew v. Union of India, 72s. Section 17 of the Indian Divorce Act, a Central pre-Constitutional Law, was challenged as arbitrary, discriminatory and violative of Art. 14. But the Kerala High Court adopted the ratio of theSupreme Court cases, cited above, that the personal Christian Law, lay outside the scope of Fundamental Rights. Though the Court did agree that s. 17 was unjustified and discriminatory yet it did not say so. The Court left the matter to the Legislature to amend the law adopting the plea that personal laws do not fall under the purview of the Fundamental Rights. The Court ruled that personal laws are outside the scope of Art. 13(1) as they are not laws as defined in Art. 13(3)(b). A word of comment on the line of decisions mentioned above may be in order at this stage. After the commencement of the Constitution, several Acts have been passed by Parliament and the State Legislatures modifying several aspects of these personal laws. Prima facie, it is difficult to argue that these statutes do not fall within the scope of Art. 13(3)(a). But because of the sensitivities of the people and the delicate nature of the issues involved, the Courts have thought it prudent not to interfere with these laws on the touchstone of Fundamental Rights and leave it to the Legislature to reform these laws so as to bring them in conformity with the Fundamental Rights. Article 13(1) says that all \"laws in force\" in India when the Constitution comes in force shall be void if inconsistent with a Fundamental Right. According to Art. 13(3)(b), the expression \"laws in force\" includeslaws passed or made by a Legislature or other competent authority.\" This is an inclusive definition. It is clear, that Art. 13(3)(b) does not exclude other forms of law besides the pre-Constitution legislative enactments. But the Court has rejected the argument that Art. 13(1)(b) is only inclusive and not exhaustive. Even if we accept the literal, technical and narrow interpretation of Art. 13(3)(b) that it refers only to pre-Constitution legislation and does not include uncodified judge-made amorphous personal laws, there is no reasons or logic in excluding from the scope of Fundamental Rights legislative Acts enacted in the area of personal laws before and after the commencement of the Constitution, such as, the Indian Divorce Act. The only explanation for this judicial stance can be that as a matter of judicial policy the courts do not wish to get involved in the delicate task of adjudging these Actsvis-à-vis Fundamental Rights.73 (b) CUSTOM What is the position of customs extant in India before the commencement of the Constitution and continued thereafter. In Gazula Dasaratha Rama Rao v. State of Andhra Pradesh, 74 the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court expressed the view that Art. 13(1) which says that laws in force in India before the commencement of the Constitution shall be void if inconsistent with Fundamental Rights \"includes custom or usage having the force of law\". The Court observed: \"Therefore, even if there was a custom which has been recognized by law... that custom must yield to a Fundamental Right\". In Sant Ram v. Labh Singh, 75 the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court ruled that a customary right of pre-emption by vicinage was void under Art. 19(1)(f).76 The Court referred to Art. 13(1)(a) which says that 'law' includes 'custom'. The Court also ruled that the definition of 'laws in force' contained in Art. 13(1)(b) \"does not in any way restrict the ambit of the word 'law' in Art.",

    "content": "Sant Ram v. Labh Singh, 75 the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court ruled that a customary right of pre-emption by vicinage was void under Art. 19(1)(f).76 The Court referred to Art. 13(1)(a) which says that 'law' includes 'custom'. The Court also ruled that the definition of 'laws in force' contained in Art. 13(1)(b) \"does not in any way restrict the ambit of the word 'law' in Art. 13(1)(a).77 In Madhu Kishwar v. State of Bihar, 78 RAMASWAMI, J., expressed the view that customs of tribals, though elevated to the status of law by Art. 13(1)(a), \"yet it is essential that the customs inconsistent with or repugnant to constitutional Scheme must always yield place to Fundamental Rights.\" Page 961 RAMASWAMI, J., adopting an activist attitude ruled that tribal women would succeed to the estate of their male relations. The majority generally agreed with this approach though it adopted a conservative approach in the specific situation and desisted from declaring a tribal custom as inconsistent with Art. 14 saying that to do so \"would bring about a chaos in the existing state of law.\"79 The majority made male succession subject to the right of livelihood of the female dependent. This discussion reveals a dichotomy in the judicial attitudes as expressed in Madhu Kishwar80 and Narasu Appa Mali81 If the Supreme Court holds customs pre-existing the constitution to be subject to Fundamental Rights, then there seems to be no reason as to why personal laws ought not to be held subject to Fundamental Rights. In the view of the author, the Supreme Court has adopted the correct approach in the cases concerning customs. In cases concerning personal laws, the courts have adopted a policy approach, rather than a legalistic approach. F. UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF A STATUTE Article 13(1) refers to pre-Constitution laws while Art. 13(2) refers to post-Constitution laws. A law is void if inconsistent with a Fundamental Right. A void statute is unenforceable, non-est, and devoid of any legal force: courts take no notice of such a statute, and it is taken to be notionally obliterated for all purposes. In Behram v. State of Bombay, 82 the Supreme Court has observed on this point: \"Where a statute is adjudged to be unconstitutional, it is as if it had never been. Rights cannot be built up under it, contracts which depend upon it for their consideration are void, it constitutes a protection to no one who has acted under it and no one can be punished for having refused obedience to it before the decision was made. And what is true of an Act void in toto is true also as to any part of an Act which is found to be unconstitutional and which consequently has to be regarded as having never at any time been possessed of any legal force....\" Any law made in contravention of Part III is dead from the very beginning and cannot at all be taken notice of or read for any purpose whatsoever.83 The above proposition is not however universally or absolutely true in all situations. It is subject to a few exceptions as follows: (1) Some Fundamental Rights apply to all persons, citizens as well as non-citizens, e.g., Arts. 14, 21, while some of these Rights, such as Art. 19, apply only to citizens.84 A law inconsistent with a Fundamental Right of the former type is ineffective qua all persons. On the other hand, a law inconsistent with a Fundamental Right available to citizens only, is non-est only qua citizens but not qua non-citizens who cannot claim the benefit of the Fundamental Right in question.85 (2) Art. 13(1) is prospective and not retrospective.86 Therefore, a pre-Constitution law inconsistent with a Fundamental Right becomes void only after the commencement of the Constitution. Any substantive rights and liabilities accruing under it prior to the enforcement of the Constitution are not nullified. It is ineffective only with respect to the enforcement of rights and liabilities in the post-Constitution period. A person was being prosecuted under a law before the Constitution came into force. After the Constitution came into force, the law became void under Art. 19(1)(a).87 It was held that Art. 13(1) could not apply to him as the offence had been committed before the enforcement of the Constitution and, therefore, the proceedings against him were not affected.88 But the procedure through which rights and liabilities were being enforced in the pre-Constitution era is a different matter. A discriminatory procedure becomes void after the commencement of the Constitution and Page 962 so it cannot operate even to enforce the pre-Constitution rights and liabilities.89 A law inconsistent with a Fundamental Right is not void as a whole. It is void only to the extent of inconsistency. This means that the doctrine of severability has to be applied and the offending portion of the law has to be severed from the valid portion thereof.90 G. DOCTRINE OF ECLIPSE The prospective nature of Art. 13(1) has given rise to the doctrine of eclipse. A legal provision enacted in 1948, authorising the State Government to exclude all private motor transport business, became inconsistent with Art. 19(1)(g) when the Constitution came into force in 1950.91 In 1951, Art. 19(1)(g) was amended so as to permit the State Government to monopolise any business.92 What was the effect of the constitutional amendment of 1951 on the law of 1948? Whether the law having become void was dead once for all and so could not be revitalised by a subsequent constitutional amendment without being re-enacted, or whether it was revived automatically?",

    "content": "was to solve this problem that the Supreme Court enunciated the doctrine of eclipse in Bhikaji v. State of Madhya Pradesh .93 The doctrine of eclipse envisages that a pre-Constitution law inconsistent with a Fundamental Right was not wiped out altogether from the statute book after the commencement of the Constitution as it continued to exist in respect of rights and liabilities which had accrued before the date of the Constitution.1 Therefore, the law in question will be regarded as having been 'eclipsed' for the time being by the relevant Fundamental Right. It was in a dormant or moribund condition for the time being. Such a law was not dead for all purposes. If the relevant Fundamental Right is amended then the effect would be \"to remove the shadow and to make the impugned Act free from all blemish or infirmity\". The law would then cease to be unconstitutional and become revivified and enforceable.2 The doctrine of eclipse has been held to apply only to the pre-Constitution and not to the post-Constitution laws. The reason is that while a pre-Constitution law was valid when enacted and, therefore, was not void ab initio, but its voidity supervened when the Constitution came into force, a post-Constitution law infringing a Fundamental Right is unconstitutional and a nullity from its very inception. Therefore, it cannot be vitalised by a subsequent amendment of the Constitution removing the infirmity in the way of passing the law.3 The Supreme Court has distinguished between Arts. 13(1) and 13(2), as the phraseology of the two is different from each other. Article 13(2) which applies to the post-Constitution laws prohibits the making of a law abridging Fundamental Rights, while Art. 13(1) which applies to the pre-Constitution laws contains no such prohibition. Under Art. 13(1), the operation of the pre-Constitution law remains unaffected until 26-1-1950, even if it becomes inoperative after the commencement of the Constitution. Under Art. 13(2), the words \"the State shall not make any law\" indicate that after the commencement of the Constitution, no law can be made so as to contravene a Fundamental Right. Such a law is void ab initio. Therefore, the doctrine of eclipse cannot apply to such a law and it cannot revive even if the relevant Fundamental Right is amended later to remove the hurdle in the way of such a law.4 In case the law contravenes a Fundamental Right limited to the citizens only, it will operate with respect to the non-citizens,5 but it will not be revived qua-citizens merely by the amendment of the Fundamental Right involved.6 Because Art. 13(2) affects the competence of the legislature to enact it with respect to the citizens, the law will have to be re-enacted after the constitutional amendment if it is desired to make it operative qua the citizens as well. An Act declared unconstitutional under Arts. 14, 19 and 31(2), is revived when it is put in the Ninth Schedule.7 The express words of Art. 31B cure the defect in such an Act with retrospective operation from the date it was put on the statute book. Such an Act even though inoperative when enacted because of its inconsistency with a Fundamental right, assumes full force and vigour retrospectively as soon as it is included in the IX Schedule. It is not necessary to re-enact such an Act.8 From this arises another question. When a post-Constitution law is held inconsistent with a Fundamental Page 963 Right, can it be revived by amending the Act in question so as to remove the blemish, or will it have to be re-enacted as a whole? The Delhi High Court has held by a majority that the Act will have to be re-enacted and it cannot be revived by its mere amendment.9 This view appears to emanate logically from the position adopted by the Supreme Court in treating such a law void ab-initio and not applying the doctrine of eclipse to the post-Constitution laws as discussed above. There is no direct Supreme Court case on the specific point. The nearest authority on the point is the Shama Rao case.10An Act was challenged on the ground of excessive delegation.11 Pending the decision, the Legislature passed an amending Act seeking to remove the defect. The Supreme Courtruled by a majority that when an Act is bad on the ground of excessive delegation, it is still-born and void ab initio, and it cannot be revived by an amending Act seeking to remove the vice. The whole Act should be re-enacted in the modified form. This ruling supports the proposition that an Act held invalid under Art. 13(2) could not be revived merely by amending it but will have to be re-enacted. The same proposition will apply when an Act infringes a Fundamental Right applicable to the citizens only. Such a law will be regarded as 'still-born' vis-à-vis the citizens even though it may be operative qua the non-citizens, and so it will have to be re-enacted if it is desired to make it valid qua the citizens.12 A reference may be made here to Hari Singh v. Military Estate Officer, Delhi .13 The Punjab Public Premises Act was declared void by the Supreme Court as being inconsistent with Art. 14.14 There was a corresponding law made by Parliament enacted in 1958. Consequent upon the Supreme Courtdecision on the Punjab Act, Parliament re-enacted its own law in 1971, seeking to remove the blemish pointed out by the Supreme Court, and made it operative retrospectively with effect from the date of commencement of the original Act. A new clause was also added saying that all orders made under the old law would be deemed to be valid and effective as if they were made under the new law. This clause was challenged, the argument being that the 1958 Act being unconstitutional, there could not be validation of anything done under an unconstitutional Act.",

    "content": "clause was challenged, the argument being that the 1958 Act being unconstitutional, there could not be validation of anything done under an unconstitutional Act. Holding the clause to be valid, the Supreme Courtcalled it a fallacious argument for it overlooked the crucial point that the 1971 Act was made effective retrospectively from the date of the 1958 Act and the action done under the 1958 Act was deemed to have been done under the 1971 Act, and the new Act was valid under Art. 14.15 H. DOCTRINE OF SEVERABILITY According to Art. 13, a law is void only \"to the extent of the inconsistency or contravention\" with the relevant Fundamental Right. The above provision means that an Act may not be void as a whole; only a part of it may be void and if that part is severable from the rest which is valid, then the rest may continue to stand and remain operative. The Act will then be read as if the invalid portion was not there. If, however, it is not possible to separate the valid from the invalid portion, then the whole of the statute will have to go.16 The Supreme Court has explained the doctrine as follows in RMDC:17 \"When a legislature whose authority is subject to limitations aforesaid enacts a law which is wholly in excess of its powers, it is entirely void and must be completely ignored. But when the legislation falls in part within the area allotted to it and in part outside it, it is undoubtedly void as to the latter; but does it on that become necessarily void in its entirety? The answer to this question must depend on whether what is valid could be separated from what is invalid, and that is a question which has to be decided by the Court on a consideration of the provisions of the Act\" The Supreme Court has laid down the following propositions as regards the doctrine of severability:18 (1) The intention of the Legislature is the determining factor in determining whether the valid parts of a statute are separable from the invalid parts. The test is whether the Legislature would have enacted the valid parts had it known that the rest of the statute was invalid.19 \"The test of severability requires the Court to ascertain whether the legislature would at all have enacted the law if severed part was not the part of the law\".20 Page 964 In determining the legislative intent on the question of severability, it will be legitimate to take into account the history of the legislation, its object, the title and the preamble to it. (2) If the valid and invalid provisions are so inextricably mixed up that they cannot be separated from one another, then the invalidity of a portion must result in the invalidity of the Act in its entirety. (3) On the other hand, if they are so distinct and separate that after striking out what is invalid, what survives can stand independently and is workable--the portion which remains is in itself a complete code independent of the rest, then it will be upheld notwithstanding that the rest had become unenforceable. If the nature or the object or the structure of the legislation is not changed by the omission of the void portion, the latter is severable from the rest.21 (4) Even when the valid provisions are distinct and separate from the invalid provisions, but if they all form part of a single scheme which is intended to operate as a whole, then the invalidity of a part will result in the failure of the whole. (5) Likewise, though the valid and invalid parts of a statute are independent and may not form part of a scheme, but what is left after omitting the invalid portion is so thin and truncated as to be in substance different from what it was when it emerged out of the legislature, then also it will be rejected in its entirety. (6) If after the invalid portion is expunged from the statute, what remains cannot be enforced without making alterations and modifications therein, then the whole of it must be struck down as void. The reason is that a Court cannot make alterations or modifications in the law in order to enforce what remains of it after expunging its invalid portion; otherwise it would amount to judicial legislation.22 (7) The severability of the valid and invalid provisions of a statute does not depend on whether the provisions are enacted in the same section or different sections; it is not the form, but the substance of the matter that is material, and that has to be ascertained on an examination of the Act as a whole and of the setting of the relevant provision therein. In the R.M.D.C.case was involved the Prize Competitions Act which was broad enough to include competitions of a gambling nature as well as those involving skill. Under Art. 19(1)(g),23Parliament could restrict prize competitions only of a gambling nature but not those involving skill. Holding that the application of the Act could be restricted to the former, the Court stated that Parliament would have still enacted the law to regulate competitions of gambling nature; nor did restricting the Act to this kind of competitions affect its texture or colour. The provisions of the Act were thus held severable in their application to competitions in which success did not depend to any substantial extent on skill. This illustrates proposition (1) mentioned above. To some extent, there exists an inconsistency between the Thappar24 and the R.M.D.C. case.",

    "content": "some extent, there exists an inconsistency between the Thappar24 and the R.M.D.C. case. When an offending provision is couched in a language wide enough to cover restrictions within and without the constitutionally permissible limits, according to the Thappar case it cannot be split up if there is a possibility of its being applied for purposes not sanctioned by the Constitution,25 but according to the R.M.D.C. case, such a provision is valid if it is severable in its application to an object which is clearly demarcated from other objects falling outside the constitutionally permissible legislation. The Supreme Court has itself pointed out this aspect of the matter in Supdt. Central Prison v. Dr. Lohia, 26 but left open the question. The Court, however, stated that in the R.M.D.C. case, the difference between the two classes of competitions, namely, those that are gambling in nature and those in which success depends on skill, was clear cut and had long been recognised in legislative practice. But when the difference between what is permissible and what is not permissible is not very precise, the whole provision is to be held void, whether the view taken in the Romesh Thappar or the R.M.D.C case is followed. It appears that it is difficult to evolve a clear cut principle as much depends on the facts of each case, the determining factor being whether, on the provision being sustained to the extent it falls within the permissible limits, is there any danger of its being misused for the purpose not permitted? If the Court has the ultimate control to decide whether a particular application of the law goes beyond the permissible limits, then there may not be any danger of misuse of the provision. If, however, the matter has been left to the subjective Page 965 satisfaction of the Executive, and the Court cannot scrutinise the basis of such satisfaction to see whether the law has been applied to a purpose not permitted, then it will be safer to declare the whole provision bad. I. WAIVER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS Can a person waive any of his Fundamental Rights? To begin with, VANKATARAMA AIYAR, J., in Behram v. State of Maharashtra, 27 divided the Fundamental Rights into two broad categories: (i) Rights conferring benefits on the individuals, and (ii) those rights conferring benefits on the general public. The learned Judge opined that a law would not be a nullity but merely unenforceable if it was repugnant with a Fundamental Right in the former category, and that the affected individual could waive such an unconstitutionality, in which case the law would apply to him. For example, the right guaranteed under Art. 19(1)(f) was for the benefit of properly-owners and when a law was found to infringe Art. 19(1)(f), it was open to any person whose right had been infringed to waive his Fundamental Right.28 In case of such a waiver, the law in question could be enforced against the individual concerned. The majority on the bench, however, was not convinced with this argument and repudiated the doctrine of waiver saying that the Fundamental Rights were not put in the Constitution merely for individual benefit. These Rights were there as a matter of public policy and, therefore, the doctrine of waiver could have no application in case of Fundamental Rights. A citizen cannot invite discrimination by telling the state 'You can discriminate', or get convicted by waiving the protection given to him under Arts. 20 and 21.29 The question of waiver of a Fundamental Right has been discussed more fully by the Supreme Court in Basheshar Nath v. I.T. Commissioner .30 The petitioner's case was referred to the Income-tax Investigation Commission under S. 5(1) of the relevant Act. After the Commission had decided upon the amount of concealed income, the petitioner on May 19, 1954, agreed as a settlement to pay in monthly instalments over Rs. 3 lacs by way of tax and penalty. In 1955, the Supreme Court declared S. 5(1)ultra vires Art. 14.31 The petitioner thereupon challenged the settlement between him and the Commission, but the plea of waiver was raised against him. The Supreme Court however upheld his contention. In their judgments, the learned Judges expounded several views regarding waiver of Fundamental Rights, viz.: (1) Art. 14 cannot be waived for it is an admonition to the state as a matter of public policy with a view to implement its object of ensuring equality. No person can, therefore, by any act or conduct, relieve the state of the solemn obligation imposed on it by the Constitution. (2) A view, somewhat broader than the first, was that none of the Fundamental Rights can be waived by a person. The Fundamental Rights are mandatory on the state and no citizen can by his act or conduct relieve the state of the solemn obligation imposed on it. The constitution makes no distinction between Fundamental Rights enacted for the benefit of an individual and those enacted in public interest or on grounds of public policy. A large majority of the people in India are economically poor, educationally backward and politically not yet conscious of their rights. Individually or even collectively, they cannot be pitted against the state, and, therefore, it is the duty of the judiciary to protect their Rights against themselves. (3) The minority judges took the view that an individual could waive a Fundamental right which was for his benefit, but he could not waive a Right which was for the benefit of the general public. This was reiteration of the view expressed by VENKATARAMAN, J., in Behram, as stated above. Page 966 In view of the majority decision in Basheshar, it is now an established proposition that an individual cannot waive any of his Fundamental Rights.32 This proposition has been applied in a number of cases.",

    "content": "to the Bombay High Court:33 \"The state cannot arrogate to itself a right to commit breach of the Fundamental Rights of any person by resorting to principles of waiver or estoppel or other similar principles.\" Similarly, the Gauhati High Court has explained that the Fundamental Rights have been embodied in the Constitution not merely for the benefit of a particular individual but also as a matter of constitutional policy and for public good, and, therefore, the doctrine of waiver or acquiescence cannot be applied thereto. \"A citizen cannot voluntarily get discrimination or waive his Fundamental Right against discrimination\" as the right of not being discriminated against is enshrined in Art. 14 and is a Fundamental Right.34 In Olga Tellis,35 the Court asserted that \"the high purpose which 'the constitution seeks to achieve by conferment of fundamental rights is not only to benefit the individual but to secure the larger interests of the community.' Therefore, even if a person says, either under mistake of law or otherwise, that he would not enforce any particular Fundamental Right, it cannot create an estoppel against him. \"Such a concession, if enforced, would defeat the purpose of the Constitution. Were the argument of estoppel valid, an all-powerful state could easily tempt an individual to forgo his precious personal freedoms on promise of transitory, immediate benefits.\" In Olga Tellis, in a writ proceeding in the High Court, the pavement dwellers gave an undertaking that they would not claim any Fundamental Right to put up huts on pavements or public roads and that they would not obstruct the demolition of the huts after a certain date. Later, when the huts were sought to be demolished after the specified date, the pavement dwellers put up the plea that they were protected by Art. 21. It was argued in the Supreme Court that they could not raise any such plea in view of their previous undertaking. The Court overruled the objection saying that Fundamental Rights could not be waived. There can be no estoppel against the Constitution which is the paramount law of the land. The constitution has conferred Fundamental Rights not only to benefit individuals but to secure the larger interests of the community. The Court observed : \"No individual can barter away the freedoms conferred on him by the Constitution\". Therefore, in spite of their earlier undertaking in the High Court, the pavement dwellers are entitled to raise the plea of Art. 21 of the Constitution in their favour.36 Recently, in Nar Singh Pal v. Union of India, 37 the Supreme Court has asserted: \"Fundamental Rights under the Constitution cannot be bartered away. They cannot be compromised nor can there be any estoppel against the exercise of Fundamental Rights available under the Constitution\". In the instant case, a casual labourer with the Telecom Department had worked continuously for 10 years and had thus acquired the \"temporary\" status. He was prosecuted for a criminal offence but was ultimately acquitted. In the meantime, his service was terminated. He questioned the order of termination but also accepted retrenchment benefit. The Supreme Court ruled that his service could not have been terminated without a departmental inquiry and without giving him a hearing. Acceptance of retrenchment benefit by him did not mean that he had surrendered all his constitutional rights. Accordingly, the order of termination was quashed by the Supreme Court and he was reinstated in service. The doctrine of non-waiver developed by the Supreme Court of India denotes manifestation of its role of protector of the Fundamental Rights. It may be of interest to know that in the U.S.A., a Fundamental Right can be waived.38 1. See, Lloyd, Introduction to Jurisprudence, 117-123, 159 (1985). 2.

The General Assembly of the United Nations Organisation adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on Dec. 10, 1948. This document has proved to be a mere declaration without any teeth. The Charter has so far remained merely a formal document without any measures having been taken to facilitate the realization of the basic freedoms and the human rights which the document contains. 7.

Ahic, Neo-Nigerian Human Rights in Zambia: A Comparative Study with some countries in Africa and West Indies, 12 J.I.L.I. 609 (1970). 8. In Europe, the Council of Europe adopted the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms on Nov. 4, 1950. The Convention has set up both a Commission and a Court of Human Rights to investigate and adjudicate upon claims made by individuals. 9. As will be apparent from the following discussion on specific Fundamental Rights, and the judicial interpretation thereof, the Supreme Court of India has frequently drawn from the Declaration of Human Rights to define the scope and content of the Fundamental Rights in India: see, for example: Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, AIR 1978 SC 597; M.H. Hoskot v. State of Maharashtra, AIR 1978 SC 1548 : (1978) 3 SCC 544; Randhir Singh v. Union of India, AIR 1982 SC 879; D.K. Basu v.

Page 975 M P Jain Indian Constitutional Law/Volume 1/PART V POLITICAL AND CIVIL RIGHTS/CHAPTER XXI FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS (2) RIGHT TO EQUALITY (i) CHAPTER XXI Fundamental Rights (2) Right to Equality (i) A. INTRODUCTORY The Constitution of India guarantees the Right to Equality through Articles 14 to 18. \"Equality is one of the magnificent corner-stones of Indian democracy.\"1 The doctrine of equality before law is a necessary corollary of Rule of Law which pervades the Indian Constitution.2 Article 14 outlaws discrimination in a general way and guarantees equality before law to all persons. In view of a certain amount of indefiniteness attached to the general principle of equality enunciated in Article 14, separate provisions to cover specific discriminatory situations have been made by subsequent Articles. Thus, Art. 15 prohibits discrimination against citizens on such specific grounds as religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. Art. 16 guarantees to the citizens of India equality of opportunity in matters of public employment. Art. 17 abolishes untouchability, and Art. 18 abolishes titles, other than a military or academic distinction. Thus, the Supreme Court has said that the Constitution lays down provisions both for protective discrimination as also affirmative action.3 In this series of constitutional provisions, Art. 14 is the most significant. It has been given a highly activist magnitude in recent years by the courts and, thus, it generates a large number of court cases. In recent days, Art. 16 has also assumed great significance because of the problems of reservation in public services. Art. 14 is the genus while Arts. 15 and 16 are the species. Arts. 14, 15 and 16 are constituents of a single code of constitutional guarantees supplementing each other. Article 14 of the Constitution embodies the principle of \"non-discrimination\". However, it is not a free standing provision. It has to be read in conjunction with rights conferred by other articles like Art. 21 of the Constitution. Article 21 refers to \"right to life\" and embodies several aspects of life. It includes \"opportunity\", Articles 21 and 14 are the heart of the chapter on Fundamental Rights. They cover myriad features of life.4 In situations not covered by Arts. 15 to 18, the general principle of equality embodied in Art. 14 is attracted whenever discrimination is alleged.",

    "content": "has to be read in conjunction with rights conferred by other articles like Art. 21 of the Constitution. Article 21 refers to \"right to life\" and embodies several aspects of life. It includes \"opportunity\", Articles 21 and 14 are the heart of the chapter on Fundamental Rights. They cover myriad features of life.4 In situations not covered by Arts. 15 to 18, the general principle of equality embodied in Art. 14 is attracted whenever discrimination is alleged. The goal set out in the Preamble to the Constitution regarding status and opportunity is embodied and concretised in Arts. 14 to 18.5 It may be worthwhile to note that Art. 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948, declares that all are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to the equal protection of laws. By and large the same concept of equality inheres in Art. 14 of the Indian Constitution. It may be noted that the right to equality has been declared by the Supreme Court as a basic feature of the Constitution. The Constitution is wedded to the concept of equality. The Preamble to the Constitution emphasizes upon the principle of equality as basic to the Constitution. This means that even a constitutional amendment offending the right to equality will be declared invalid.6 Neither Parliament nor any State Legislature can transgress the principle of equality.7 This principle has been recently reiterated by the Supreme Court in Badappanavar8 in the following words: \"Equality is a basic feature of the Constitution of India and any treatment of equals unequally or unequals as equals will be violation of basic structure of the Constitution of India.\" Page 976 B. EQUALITY BEFORE LAW : ART. 14 A constitution bench of the Supreme Court has declared in no uncertain terms that equality is a basic feature of the constitution and although the emphasis in the earlier decisions evolved around discrimination and classification, the content of Article 14 got expanded conceptually and has recognized the principles to comprehend the doctrine of promissory estoppel non arbitrariness, compliance with rules of natural justice eschewing irrationality etc.9 If there is no affectation of a vested right, the question of applicability of Art. 14 would not arise.10 Such an absolute proposition is inconsistent with the recognition by the Supreme Court in or in many of its earlier judgments in relation to promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation which are not only much short of indefeasible right but were evolved to protect a person from unfair or arbitrary exercise of power.11 Moreover Article 14 itself confers a 'vested' Fundamental Right and it is difficult to appreciate the logic behind the enunciation. Article 14 bars discrimination and prohibits discriminatory laws. Art. 14 is now proving as a bulwark against any arbitrary or discriminatory state action. The horizons of equality as embodied in Art. 14 have been expanding as a result of the judicial pronouncements and Art. 14 has now come to have a \"highly activist magnitude\". Articles 14 and 15 read in the light of the preamble to the Constitution reflect the thinking of our Constitution makers and prevent any discrimination based on religion or origin in the matter of equal treatment or employment and to apply the same even in respect of a cooperative society.12 All persons in similar circumstances shall be treated alike both in privileges and liabilities imposed.13 But equality cannot be applied when it arises out of illegality e.g. when Art. 14 is sought to be involved in aid of compassionate appointment wrongly made earlier.14 It has been held that non application of mind is a facet of arbitrary exercise of power.15 It is now firmly established that Art. 14 strikes at arbitrary state action, both administrative and legislative. There has been a significant shift towards equating arbitrary or unreasonableness as the yardstick by which administrative as well as legislative actions are to be judged. A basic and obvious test to be applied in cases where administrative action is attacked as arbitrary is to see whether there is any discernible principle emerging from the impugned action and if so, does it really satisfy the test of reasonableness.16 It is now considered that non-compliance with the rules of natural justice amounts to arbitrariness violating Art. 14.17 The Supreme Court has quoted with approval the following observations of Bharucha J sitting in the Bombay High Court.18 \"....the government company or corporation must act reasonably not only when terminating the authority of an occupant of public premises ...... to occupy the same but also when, thereafter, it seeks his eviction therefrom\". This approval, therefore means that the landlord State's act in initiating proceedings must be not only substantively but also procedurally reasonable.19 For propagating this reasonable and fairness principle the court relied upon its earlier judgments in relation to Rent Acts.20 There is no discrimination merely because a state policy had not been introduced simultaneously at different levels.21 The Court explained that when policies are made which have far reaching implications and are dynamic in nature, their implementation in a phased manner is welcome because it receives gradual willing acceptance and invites lesser resistance.22 Art. 14 runs as follows : \"The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India.\" This provision corresponds to the equal protection clause Page 977 of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution which declares: \"No State shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" Two concepts are involved in Art. 14, viz., 'equality before law' and 'equal protection of laws'. The first is a negative concept which ensures that there is no special privilege in favour of any one, that all are equally subject to the ordinary law of the land and that no person, whatever be his rank or condition, is above the law.",

    "content": "viz., 'equality before law' and 'equal protection of laws'. The first is a negative concept which ensures that there is no special privilege in favour of any one, that all are equally subject to the ordinary law of the land and that no person, whatever be his rank or condition, is above the law. This is equivalent to the second corollary of the Dicean concept of the Rule of Law in Britain.23 This, however, is not an absolute rule and there are a number of exceptions to it, e.g., foreign diplomats enjoy immunity from the country's judicial process; Art. 361 extends immunity to the President of India and the State Governors;24 public officers and judges also enjoy some protection, and some special groups and interests, like the trade unions, have been accorded special privileges by law. The second concept, 'equal protection of laws', is positive in content. It does not mean that identically the same law should apply to all persons, or that every law must have a universal application within the country irrespective of differences of circumstances. Equal Protection of the laws does not postulate equal treatment of all persons without distinction. What it postulates is the application of the same laws alike and without discrimination to all persons similarly situated. It denotes equality of treatment in equal circumstances. It implies that among equals the law should be equal and equally administered, that the like should be treated alike without distinction of race, religion, wealth, social status or political influence.25 Where a particular mode is prescribed for doing an act and there is no impediment in adopting the procedure, the deviation to act in different manner which does not disclose any discernible principle which is reasonable in itself shall be labelled as arbitrary. Every State action must be informed by reason and it follows that an act uninformed by reason is per se arbitrary.26 The Supreme Court has explained in Sri Srinivasa Theatre v. Govt. of Tamil Nadu, 27 that the two expressions 'equality before law' and 'equal protection of law' do not mean the same thing even if there may be much in common between them. \"Equality before law\" is a dynamic concept having many facets. One facet is that there shall be no privileged person or class and that none shall be above law. Another facet is \"the obligation upon the State to bring about, through the machinery of law, a more equal society... For, equality before law can be predicated meaningfully only in an equal society....\" Article 14 provides positive and not negative equality. Hence any action or order contrary to law does not confer any right upon any person for similar treatment. Thus unauthorized additional construction and change of user of land cannot be claimed on the basis that the same had been granted in other cases in contravention of law.28 Article 14 prescribes equality before law. But the fact remains that all persons are not equal by nature, attainment or circumstances, and, therefore, a mechanical equality before the law may result in injustice. Thus, the guarantee against the denial of equal protection of the law does not mean that identically the same rules of law should be made applicable to all persons in spite of difference in circumstances or conditions.29 The varying needs of different classes or sections of people require differential and separate treatment. The Legislature is required to deal with diverse problems arising out of an infinite variety of human relations. It must, therefore, necessarily have the power of making laws to attain particular objects and, for that purpose, of distinguishing, selecting and classifying persons and things upon which its laws are to operate. The principle of equality of law thus means not that the same law should apply to everyone but that a law should deal alike with all in one class; that there should be an equality of treatment under equal circumstances. It means \"that equals should not be treated unlike and unlikes should not be treated alike. Likes should be treated alike\".30 But when charge of discrimination was made for treating diploma holders and degree holders in the same category, the Supreme Court suddenly said that Art.14 cannot be stretched too far as it will paralyse the administration and repelled the challenge.31 Art. 14 thus means that 'equals should be treated alike'; it does not mean that 'unequals ought to be treated Page 978 equally'. Persons who are in the like circumstances should be treated equally. On the other hand, where persons or groups of persons are not situated equally, to treat them as equals would itself be violative of Art. 14 as this would itself result in inequality. As all persons are not equal by nature or circumstances, the varying needs of different classes or sections of people require differential treatment. This leads to classification among different groups of persons and differentiation between such classes. Accordingly, to apply the principle of equality in a practical manner, the courts have evolved the principle that if the law in question is based on rational classification it is not regarded as discriminatory.32 The clubbing of those dealers against whom there was no allegation with the handful of those against whom there were allegations of political connection and patronage, results in treating unequals as equals.33 Equality of opportunity embraces two different and distinct concepts. There is a conceptual distinction between a non discrimination principle and affirmative action under which the State is obliged to provide a level playing field to the oppressed classes. Affirmative action in the above sense seeks to move beyond the concept of non discrimination towards equalising results with respect to various groups. Both the conceptions constitute 'equality of opportunity'.34 A Legislature is entitled to make reasonable classification for purposes of legislation and treat all in one class on an equal footing. The Supreme Court has underlined this principle thus: \" Art.",

    "content": "action in the above sense seeks to move beyond the concept of non discrimination towards equalising results with respect to various groups. Both the conceptions constitute 'equality of opportunity'.34 A Legislature is entitled to make reasonable classification for purposes of legislation and treat all in one class on an equal footing. The Supreme Court has underlined this principle thus: \" Art. 14 of the Constitution ensures equality among equals: its aim is to protect persons similarly placed against discriminatory treatment. It does not however operate against rational classification. A person setting up a grievance of denial of equal treatment by law must establish that between persons similarly circumstanced, some were treated to their prejudice and the differential treatment had no reasonable relation to the object sought to be achieved by the law.\"35In the context of Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act, 1966 and the Regulations framed thereunder it has been held that fixation of price at a higher rate for small and fully developed plots and at a lower rate for a large plot not entirely developed and provided with peripheral infrastructural facilities only, was not arbitrary.36 Appointment on compassionate ground is never considered a right of a person. In fact, such appointment is violative of rule of equality enshrined and guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution. When any appointment is to be made in Government or semi government or in public office, cases of all eligible candidates must be considered alike. This is the mandate of Article 14. Normally, therefore, the State or its instrumentality making any appointment to public office, cannot ignore such mandate. At the same time, however, in certain circumstances, appointment on compassionate ground of dependants of the deceased employee is considered inevitable so that the family of the deceased employee may not starve. The primary object of such scheme is to save the bereaved family from sudden financial crisis occurring due to death of the sole bread earner. It is thus an exception to the general rule of equality and not another independent and parallel source of employment.37 The court has distinguished employment based on descent and compassionate appointment as the latter is based on an additional factor, namely, death or medical invalidation of a serving employee leaving the family in distress and such a factor may constitute a valid basis of classification.38 Article 14 forbids class legislation; it does not forbid reasonable classification of persons, objects and transactions by the Legislature for the purpose of achieving specific ends. Classification to be reasonable should fulfil the following two tests: (1) It should not be arbitrary, artificial or evasive. It should be based on an intelligible differentia, some real and substantial distinction, which distinguishes persons or things grouped together in the class from others left out of it. (2) The differentia adopted as the basis of classification must have a rational or reasonable nexus with the object sought to be achieved by the statute in question.39 Hostile discrimination is obvious where some allottees despite having complied with all conditions, including payment of full amount due, were not given possession, whereas others were granted possession even before payment or after depositing a small proportion of the total dues.40 What is however necessary is that there must be a substantial basis for making the classification and that Page 979 there should be a nexus between the basis of classification and the object of the statute under consideration. In other words, there must be some rational nexus between the basis of classification and the object intended to be achieved. Therefore, mere differentiation or inequality of treatment does not per se amount to discrimination within the inhibition of the equal protection clause. To attract Art. 14, it is necessary to show that the selection or differentiation is unreasonable or arbitrary; that it does not rest on any rational basis having regard to the object which the Legislature has in view in making the law in question.41 As the Supreme Courthas explained: \"The differentia which is the basis of the classification and the Act are distinct things and what is necessary is that there must be a nexus between them.\"42 As the Supreme Court has observed recently in Thimmappa:43 \"When a law is challenged to be discriminatory essentially on the ground that it denies equal treatment or protection, the question for determination by the Court is not whether it has resulted in inequality but whether there is some difference which bears a just and reasonable relation to the object of legislation. Mere differentiation does not per se amount to discrimination within the inhibition of the equal protection clause. To attract the operation of the clause it is necessary to show that the selection or differentiation is unreasonable or arbitrary, that it does not rest on any rational basis having regard to the object which the legislature has in view\". Again, the Supreme Court has observed:44 \"It is settled law that differentiation is not always discriminatory. If there is a rational nexus on the basis of which differentiation has been made with the object sought to be achieved by particular provision, then such differentiation is not discriminatory and does not violate the principles of Article 14 of the Constitution\". The Supreme Court has however warned against over-emphasis on classification. The Court has explained that 'the doctrine of classification is only a subsidiary rule evolved by the courts to give practical content to the doctrine of equality, over-emphasis on the doctrine of classification or anxious or sustained attempt to discover some basis for classification may gradually and imperceptibly erode the profound potency of the glorious content of equity enshrined in Art. 14 of the Constitution. The over-emphasis on classification would inevitably result in substitution of the doctrine of classification for the doctrine of equality...",

    "content": "of the Constitution. The over-emphasis on classification would inevitably result in substitution of the doctrine of classification for the doctrine of equality... Lest, the classification would deny equality to the larger segments of the society'.45 Marginal over inclusiveness or under inclusiveness, will not vitiative the classification.46 Whether a classification adopted by a law is reasonable or not is a matter for the courts to decide. Caterpillar47 is another example of under classification and Article 14. Here a preference policy was adopted by which the Government granted price preference to Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs) to the effect that the price quoted by them which was less than 10% of the lowest price would be reckoned while taking a decision on finalizing the tender. The Supreme Court found that the policy suffered from under classification and since an uniform policy of protection without considering whether such protection was necessary or not was arbitrary. The question of reasonableness of classification has arisen in innumerable cases. The twin tests applied for the purpose are, however, quite flexible. The courts, however, show a good deal of deference to legislative judgment and do not lightly hold a classification unreasonable. A study of the cases will show that many different classifications have been upheld as constitutional.48 There is no closed category of classification; the extent, range and kind of classification depend on the subject-matter of the legislation, the conditions of the country, the economic, social and political factors at work at a particular time. The differential treatment must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved. Constitutional interpretation being a difficult task, its concept varies from statute to statute, fact to fact, situation to situation and subject matter to subject matter.49 There is no discrimination when a financial benefit is made available for those who had been invalidated out of service because of their tenure of service was reduced due to invalidment on account of disability or war injury and those who retired in the normal course.50 And merely because in the past two categories of employees had been treated differently does not mean that they cannot be equated subsequently.51 It is not necessary that for a classification to be valid, its basis must always appear on the face of the law. To find out the reasons and the justification for the classification, the court may refer to relevant material, e.g. objects and reasons appended to a Bill, parliamentary debates, affidavits of the parties, matters of common Page 980 knowledge, the background circumstances leading to the passage of the Act, etc.52 The concept of equality allows differential treatment but it prevents distinctions that are not properly justified. Justification needs each case to be decided on a case to case basis.53 For example, there is no discrimination by reason of non-alteration of allotment price for a plot of land in 1993 paid by a person for a larger plot exchanged in 1996 whereas another person whose allotment was made in 1996 at 1996 price since the price paid by the former for the exchanged land had been held constant only for the acreage allotted in 1993 and for the excess acreage allotted in 1996, the former had also been charged at the 1996 price.54 When a person seeks to impeach the validity of a law on the ground that it offends Art. 14, the onus is on him to plead and prove the infirmity. If a person complains of unequal treatment, the burden lies on him to place before the court sufficient material from which it can be inferred that there is unequal treatment. A mere plea that he has been treated differentially is not enough. He must produce necessary facts and figures to establish, that he has not only been treated differently from others, but that he has been so treated from persons similarly situated and circumstanced without any reasonable basis and that such differential treatment has been made unjustifiably. The initial presumption is in favour of the validity of the law, and if the person fails to adduce sufficient evidence in support of his challenge to the law in question, his plea of the provision in question being violative of Art. 14 cannot be entertained. The state can lean on the initial presumption of validity of the law.55 The Supreme Court has recently explained the principle of initial presumption of validity as follows in Ashutosh Gupta v. State of Rajasthan :56 \"There is always a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of enactment and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show that there has been a clear transgression of the constitutional principles. The presumption of constitutionality stems from the wide power of classification which the legislature must, of necessity possess in making laws operating differently as regards different groups of persons in order to give effect to policies. It must be presumed that the legislature understands and correctly appreciates the need of its own people.\" The Supreme Court has explained the rationale underlying this rule as follows: many a time, the challenge is based on the allegation that the impugned provision is discriminatory as it singles out the petitioner for hostile treatment, from amongst persons who, being situated similarly, belong to the same class as the petitioner. Whether there are other persons who are situated similarly as the petitioner is a question of fact. And whether the petitioner is subjected to hostile discrimination is also a question of fact. That is why the burden to establish the existence of these facts rests on the petitioner. \"To cast the burden of proof in such cases on the state is really to ask it to prove the negative that no other persons are situated similarly as the petitioner and that the treatment meted out to the petitioner is not hostile.\"57 Hostile discrimination can only arise as between persons who are similarly situated.",

Hence, it was not possible for the candidate for Deputy Manager's post to claim that he had been discriminated against because a Joint Manager had been appointed since there was nothing common between the two posts. It was perfectly valid for the employer to fill up one category of posts and decline to do so for other categories of posts for business reasons.58 Thus, in Nachane,59 when the employees of the Life Insurance Corporationwere exempted from the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act (IDA) by a law of Parliament, and these employees challenged the law as discriminatory, theSupreme Court stated that the burden of establishing hostile discrimination was on the petitioners (L.I.C. employees); it was for them to show that they and the employees of other establishments to whom the provisions of the IDA applied were similarly circumstanced to justify the contention that by excluding the LIC employees from the purview of the IDA they had been discriminated against. No materials had been produced before the Court for the purpose. There cannot be perfect equality in any matter on an absolute scientific basis and certain inequities here and there would not offend Art. 14.60 Again exclusion of prisoners convicted of crimes against women from scheme of remission to prevent crimes against women cannot be said to violate any reasonable principle or concept of law.61 It has been held that IMNS is a distinct and separate class by itself, even though it is a part of the Indian Army.62 In other words permissible classification would include a class even though it is a part of a larger class. A statute carries with it a presumption of Constitutionality. Such a presumption extends also in relation to a law which has been enacted for imposing reasonable restrictions on the Fundamental Rights. A further Page 981 presumption may also be drawn that the statutory authority would not exercise the power arbitrarily.63 On the other hand, if discrimination is writ large on the face of the legislation, the onus may shift to the state to sustain the validity of the legislation in question.64 In Deepak Sibal v. Punjab University, 65 the Supreme Court has pointed out that a classification need not be made with \"mathematical precision\". But, if there is little or no difference between the persons or things which have been grouped together and those left out of the group, then classification cannot be regarded as reasonable. The Court has also pointed out that to consider reasonableness of classification it is necessary to take into account the objective for such classification. \"If the objective be illogical, unfair and unjust, necessarily the classification will have to be held as unreasonable.\" Also, surrounding circumstances may be taken into consideration in support of the constitutionality of a law which may otherwise be hostile or discriminatory in nature. \"But the circumstances must be such as to justify the discriminatory treatment or the classification subserving the object sought to be achieved.\" At times, even administrative necessity or convenience has been upheld as a basis of classification.66 This is especially so in matters of taxation and economic regulation, because of the complexities involved in these areas, e.g., a bewildering conflict of expert opinion exists on economic matters.67 Considering the totality of circumstances and the financial climate world over, if it was thought as a matter of policy to have speedier legal method to recover dues over and above statutes already in existence providing for speedy recovery, such a policy decision cannot be faulted nor is it a matter to be gone into by the Courts, to test the legitimacy of such a measure relating to financial policy.68 The effect of these various principles is to enable the courts to uphold legislation in most of the cases and give the benefit of doubt as to the purpose of classification to the legislature. On the whole, the courts show reluctance to void legislation on the ground of its incompatibility with Art. 14. This judicial self-limitation has been taken to such length that, at times, voices of protest have been raised from the bench itself against too much judicial anxiety \"to discover some basis for classification\". A warning has been sounded that such an approach would substitute the doctrine of classification for the doctrine of equality and deprive it of much of its content. The Supreme Court has stated: \"Over emphasis on the doctrine of classification or an anxious and sustained attempt to discover some basis for classification may gradually and imperceptibly deprive the guarantee of equality of its spacious content.\"69 But the fact remains that many a time the Supreme Court itself has ignored this warning and upheld legislation, as stated above, by finding some policy within the law. Article 14 will apply even if the laws emanate from the Parliament and a State legislature. As such since the compensation payable under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 to the landowner would be more than what is payable under the Land Acquisition and Requisition, U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad Adhiniyam, 1965 (1 of 1966), Sections 29 and 32 of the Adhiniyam were violative of Article 14 and the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act are to be read into the provisions of the Adhiniyam.70 Article 14 does not mandate that a person should be granted illegal and unjustified relief similar to those granted to others earlier.71 The Supreme Courthas reiterated that the Courts cannot act as an Appellate Authority and examine the correctness, suitability and appropriateness of a policy nor are courts advisors to the executive on matters of policy which the executive is entitled to formulate.",

    "content": "review in this area is confined to the examination as to whether any Fundamental Rights have been violated or it is opposed to the provisions of the Constitution or any statutory provision or is manifestly arbitrary. It is through this \"manifestly arbitrary door\" that challenges are likely to be made to formulation of policies and in such a case the Court must necessarily examine the provisions of the policy to come to the conclusion as to whether it is manifestly arbitrary or not. In effect the Court to a certain extent will act as an appellate authority although the court says that the courts cannot act as such an appellate authority.72 The Court rejected the challenge to the granting of national film awards by saying that the object was to select the best of Indian films made for public exhibition in various categories and give them national awards. The precise question which arose was as to whether the Government could impose a condition that the entry of films for the awards will be restricted to only those Page 982 which posses a certificate issued by the Censor Board under Section 5A of the Act. These matters were considered by the Court to be matters of policy and judicial review is concerned with the legality of the policy and not the wisdom or soundness of the policy. It emphasizes that there was nothing illogical or unreasonable or arbitrary about a policy to select only the best from among films certified for public exhibition. Arbitrariness on the possibility that a power may be abused, despite the guidelines, in the provisions providing for such power cannot be held to be arbitrary and unreasonable.73 When a statute is impugned under Art. 14, it is the function of the court to decide whether the statute is so arbitrary or unreasonable that it has to be struck down. At best, a statute upon a similar subject deriving its authority from another source can be referred to, if its provisions have been held to be unreasonable, or have stood the test of time, only for the purpose of indicating what may be said to be reasonable in the context,74 and the extent to which it is not unconstitutional.75 Perpetuation of hostile discrimination is not contemplated within Art. 14.76 But the court has held that even if a law cannot be declared ultra vires on the ground of hardship, it can be so declared on the ground of total unreasonableness applying the Wednesbury \"unreasonableness\".77 The benefit of \"equality before law\" and \"equal protection of law\" accrues to every person in India whether a citizen or not. As the Supreme Court has observed on this point: \"We are a country governed by the Rule of Law. Our Constitution confers certain rights on every human-being and certain other rights on citizens. Every person is entitled to equality before the law and the equal protection of the laws.\"78 C. ILLUSTRATIONS The question of reasonableness of classification vis-a-vis Art. 14 in the light of the principles stated above has arisen before the courts in a large number of cases. Some of these cases are noted below. (a) MISCELLANEOUS SITUATIONS Heirs of landowners sought restoration of their acquired lands in terms of Standing Order 28 framed by State Government read with para 493 of Land Administration Manual providing for return of the agricultural lands to landowners or their heirs when the lands were no longer required for the purposes for which those were acquired. While acting on the said policy decision, the government released lands in favour of some other persons, but respondents' claim for restoration of their lands was denied without showing why the policy could not be applied in favour of respondents also. Though Standing Order 28 and para 493 did not create any right in favour of any person to get back possession of the land, but while acting under such standing order or manual the government cannot discriminate between persons similarly situated.79 It is valid to exempt military and naval messes and canteens from restrictions on use or consumption of liquor, for military has its own traditions and mode of life and, therefore, there is an understandable basis for classification. The differentiation made by the prohibition law between Indians and foreigners staying in India for a short time is also valid.80 For admission to a medical college of a State non-residents were required to pay capitation fee but residents in the State were exempt from the same. This classification, based on residence within the State, is valid.81 In relation to S. Sections 18 of the Atomic Energy Act, 1962 which confers power on the Central Government to make orders restricting the disclosure of certain specified information, has been held to be valid. TheSupreme Courtnoted the sensitivity of the subject matter of the Act and pointed out that it could not be said the section employed words which provided for no criteria nor could it be said that no standard had been laid down by Parliament the exercise of the power. It is furthermore not a case where principles on which the Page 983 power of the Central Government is to be exercised have not been disclosed or essential legislative functions have been delegated.82 A State law passed with a view to preserve and improve livestock permitted the killing of buffaloes, sheep and goats, but totally banned the killing of cows, bulls and calves. Cows and their calves, bulls and bullocks are important for the agricultural economy of the country; female buffaloes are milch cattle; bullocks are more useful as draught animals than male buffaloes; sheep and goat have not much utility as draught or milch animals.",

    "content": "different categories of animals being thus susceptible of classification into separate groups on the basis of their usefulness to society, the butchers killing each category may also be placed in distinct classes according to the effect their occupations produce on society, and, accordingly, the Act was held valid.83 Difference between Indian and European prisoners in the matter of treatment and diet violates Art. 14.84 Where some allottees despite having complied with all conditions, including payment of full amount due, were not given possession, whereas others were even before making payment or after depositing a small proportion of the total due, it was indicative of hostile discrimination against the allottees who have paid up and that undue favour had been shown to the others.85 In Ram Sarup v. Munshi86, the Supreme Court has held that the right of pre-emption based on consanguinity did not infringe Art. 19(1)(f). But, later, in Ram Prakash v. State of Haryana, 87 the Court ruled that such a right is inconsistent with Art. 14 characterising it as \"a relic of the feudal past\" and \"inconsistent with modern ideas\". Right of pre-emption in favour of co-sharers or tenants has however been held to be valid. Failure to implement a scheme within a reasonable time may amount to unreasonableness infringing Art.14.88 The Bihar Hindu Religious Trusts Act excludes the Sikhs from its purview and provides for separate trust boards for Hindus and Jains. This is valid because there are some differences between Hindus, Sikhs and Jains in essential details of their faiths, religious practices and organisation of their trusts; it cannot be said that Sikhs, Hindus and Jains are situated alike in the matter of religious trusts in Bihar.89 Under the Land Acquisition Act, the government can acquire land for a government company or a public company but not for a private company or an individual. This is a valid classification. The intention of the legislature clearly is that private companies should not have the advantage of acquiring land inasmuch as the profit of their venture goes to a few hands.90 In-service employees and retirees form different classes and, as such, there was no violation of Article 14 if they are treated differently, namely, where full and free medical facilities is provided to in-service defence personnel but not to retired defence employees.91 A legal provision providing for compulsory transfer of land by a landowner to the municipal committee for a public purpose without payment of compensation has been held to be violative of Art. 14.92 The imposition of the condition of prohibition on transfer of land granted to a backward class for a particular period does not constitute any unreasonable restriction.93 Special provisions can be made by a Legislature to protect and preserve the economic interests of persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and to prevent their exploitation.94 When a statute provides for consultation but procedure for holding such consultation, the competent authority can evolve its own procedure and such a provision cannot be held to be arbitrary.95 The Kerala Agrarian Relations Act, 1961, fixing the maximum land-ceiling in the State was declared to be discriminatory under Art. 14 on three grounds: (i) it fixed a ceiling on tea, coffee and rubber plantations but not on those of areca and pepper and there appeared to be no reason for making such a distinction; (ii) by giving an artificial definition to the term 'family' which did not conform to any type of families in the State, Page 984 discrimination arose in the matter of land-holding; (iii) for land in excess of the ceiling, different cuts were made if the amount of compensation was over Rs. 15,000 and this was discriminatory as there was no reason why two persons should be paid at different rates when they were deprived of property of the same kind but only different in extent.96 The provisions of the Public Premises Eviction Acts and the Rules are required to be construed in the light of the tests as envisaged under Article 14 of the Constitution and with a view to give effect thereto, the doctrine of purposive construction may have to be taken recourse to.97 Whenever an Act is amended, there is bound to be some difference in treatment between transactions completed before the amendment and those which are to take place in future, but this is not discriminatory under Art. 14.98 Mere absence of provision for representation/appeal, would not render a discretionary power arbitrary or discriminatory when such power was exercised by the highest authority and for specified reason.99 A rule of the Rajasthan High Court required that for appointment to the Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service, an advocate must have practised for 7 years in the High Court of Rajasthan, or the courts subordinate thereto. In Moolchandani,99a the Supreme Court declared the rule as being inconsistent with Art. 14 as the classification made by the rule was not founded on any intelligible differentia having a reasonable nexus with the object sought to be achieved. (b) UNGUIDED DISCRETION Discretion exercisable according to a policy or for a purpose clearly stated in the statute, is not unrestricted discretion.99b and, as such, the statute cannot be considered as conferring arbitrary power. (c) CUT-OFF DATES The Government issued an office memorandum announcing a liberalised pension scheme for retired government servants but made it applicable to those who had retired after March 31, 1979. The Supreme Court in Nakara1 held the fixing of the cut-off date to be discriminatory as violating Art. 14. The Court argued that all pensioners retiring either before the cut-off date or thereafter formed one class. The division of pensioners into two classes on the basis of the date of retirement was not based on any rational principle because a difference of two days in the matter of retirement could have a traumatic effect on the pensioner. Such a classification was held to be arbitrary and unprincipled as there was no acceptable or persuasive reason in its favour.",

    "content": "The Court argued that all pensioners retiring either before the cut-off date or thereafter formed one class. The division of pensioners into two classes on the basis of the date of retirement was not based on any rational principle because a difference of two days in the matter of retirement could have a traumatic effect on the pensioner. Such a classification was held to be arbitrary and unprincipled as there was no acceptable or persuasive reason in its favour. The said classification had no rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved. But the Court has recognised that whenever a cut off date is fixed, a question may arise as to why a person would suffer only because he comes within the wrong side of the cut-off date. But the fact that some persons or a section of society would face hardship, by itself, cannot be a ground for holding that the cut-off date so fixed is ultra vires Article 14.2 The Nakara ruling was considered by the Supreme Court in Krishna Kumar v. Union of India .3 The Supreme Court ruled in this case that the option given to the employees covered by the Provident Fund Scheme to switch over to the pension scheme with effect from the specified cut-off date would not be violative of Art. 14. The Court argued that Nakara never required that all retirees formed a class and that no further classification could be possible. Pension-retirees and provident-fund-retirees do not form one homogeneous class and different rules apply to the two groups. It would not therefore be reasonable to argue that whatever applies to the pension-retirees must also be equally applicable to the provident-fund-retirees. The rights of each provident fund retirees crystallise on his retirement and no continuing obligation remains thereafter. But in case of a pension retiree, the obligation continues till his death. Financial constraint is a valid ground for fixation of cut-off date for grant of benefit of increased quantum of death-cum-retirement gratuity. The action of Government in limiting the said benefit to government employees who died or retired on or after 1-4-1995 i.e. the cut-off date was not arbitrary, irrational or violative of Art. 14.4 Page 985 When the army personnel claimed on the basis of Nakara the same pension rights irrespective of their date of retirement, the Supreme Court negatived the contention in Indian Ex-Service League v. Union of India \"5 According to an office memorandum issued in 1979, a portion of the dearness allowance was to be treated as pay for the purpose of retirement benefits in respect of government servants who retired on or after the 30th September, 1977. The government servants who had retired before 30th September, 1977, claimed citing Nakara that the benefit ought to have been extended to all retired government servants irrespective of their date of retirement. The Supreme Court rejected this contention and upheld the validity of the memorandum in Union of India v. B.P.N. Menon, 6 thus, adopting a stance at variance with Nakara. The Court now took the position that any revised scheme in respect of post-retirement benefits can be implemented from a cut-off date which can be regarded as reasonable and rational in the light of Art. 14. The Court now maintained that whenever a revision takes place, a cut-off date becomes imperative because the benefit has to be allowed within the financial resources available with the government. Due to many constraints, it is not always possible to confer the same benefits to one and all irrespective of the dates of their retirements. The memorandum in the instant case was the result of an agreement between the government and the staff union. It was based on the recommendation of the Third Pay Commission. The date fixed as the cut-off date was held to be as not arbitrary as the price index level on this date had reached 272. The Court observed: \"Not only in matters of revising the pensionary benefits but even in respect of revision of scales of pay, a cut-off date on some rational or reasonable basis has to be fixed for extending the benefits.\" The respondent, a commissioned officer retired on May 18, 1982. According to the rules prevailing at the time, he was held not entitled to any pension. On January 1, 1986, the rules were amended and persons in his position now became entitled to pensionary benefits. He now laid a claim for grant of pension pleading the Nakara ruling in his support. But the Court rejected his claim holding that the ratio of Nakara had no application to the factual situation in the instant case.7Nakara prohibited discrimination between pensioners forming a single class and bound by the same rules. The cut-off date chosen in that case was held to be arbitrary. In the instant case the respondent was not eligible for pension under the rules prevalent then. The new rules were not given any retrospective effect and, therefore, the respondent cannot claim any pension because of the new rule \"This is not a case where a discrimination is being made among pensioners who were similarly situated\". The Supreme Court has observed in the case noted below:8 \"It is open to the State or to the Centre, as the case may be, to change the conditions of service unilaterally. Terminal benefits as well as pensionary benefits constitute conditions of service. The employer has the undoubted power to revise the salaries and/or the pay scales as also terminal benefits/pensionary benefits. The power to specify a date from which the revisions of pay scales or terminal benefits/pensionary benefits, as the case may be, shall take effect is a concomitant of the said power. So long as such date is specified in a reasonable manner, i.e., without bringing about a discrimination between similarly situated persons, no interference is called for by the court in that behalf...",

    "content": "long as such date is specified in a reasonable manner, i.e., without bringing about a discrimination between similarly situated persons, no interference is called for by the court in that behalf... The only question is whether the prescription of the date is unreasonable or discriminatory...\"9 In Hari Ram Gupta v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 10 the State Government refused to give the benefit of pension to those who had retired prior to the coming into force of the new rules. Refusing to apply the Nakara ruling to the instant factual situation, the Court pointed out that in Nakara all pensioners formed a class as a whole and the Court refused to micro-classify them by an arbitrary, unprincipled and unreasonable eligibility criteria. In the case noted below,11 the employees were governed by the contributory Provident Fund Scheme. With effect from 1-7-1986, a scheme was introduced. The question which arose was whether the pension scheme ought to be applied to those who had already retired before the introduction of the pension scheme, i.e. 1-7-1986. The Supreme Court rejected the claim. As per the rules prevalent at the time, the retirees had received all their retiral benefits. If the pension scheme were made applicable to all past retirees, the resulting financial burden would amount to Rs. 200 crores which would be beyond the capacity of the employer. The reasons given for introducing the scheme from 1-7-1986 inter alia was financial constraint--a valid ground. The Court ruled that the \"retired\" employees and those who were in employment on 1-7-1986, Page 986 \"cannot be treated alike as they do not belong to one class. The workmen, who had retired after receiving all the benefits available under the Contributory Provident Fund Scheme, cease to be employees of the appellant Board w.e.f. the date of their retirement. They form a separate class.\" Thus, there was no illegality in introducing the pension scheme prospectively from 1-7-1986, and not making it applicable retrospectively to those who had retired before that date. A regulation providing for termination of service of an air hostess in Air India International on her first pregnancy has been held to be arbitrary and abhorrent to the notions of a civilized society.12Exclusion from the Minimum Wages Act of the workmen employed by government on famine relief work, and payment to them of wages lower than the minimum wages, violates Art. 14, \"The rights of all the workers will be the same whether they are drawn from an area affected by drought and scarcity conditions or come from elsewhere.\"13 Stipends payable by the State Government to the post-graduate students of Agricultural university as well as of medical colleges, were enhanced but from different dates. The Court declared it to be discriminatory as the State Government failed to show that there was any reasonable basis or intelligible differential for fixing different dates for paying increased stipends to the two streams of students, especially when the Government had been maintaining parity all along among these students.14 (d) LANDLORD-TENANT RELATIONSHIP The position of law is settled that the State and its authorities including instrumentalities of States have to be just, fair and reasonable in all their activities including those in the field of contracts. Thus even while playing the role of a landlord or a tenant, the State and its authorities remain so and cannot be heard or seen causing displeasure or discomfort to Article 14. The State and its instrumentalities, as landlords have the liberty of revising the rates of rent so as to compensate themselves against loss caused by inflationary tendencies. They can and rather must also save themselves from negative balances caused by the cost of maintenance, payment of taxes and costs of administration. The State, as the landlord, need not necessarily be a benevolent and good charitable Samaritan. However, the State cannot be seen to be indulging in rack renting, profiteering and indulging in whimsical or unreasonable evictions or bargains. Having been exempted from the operation of rent control legislation, the courts cannot hold them tied to the same shackles from which the State and its instrumentalities have been freed by the legislature in its wisdom and thereby requiring them to be ruled indirectly or by analogy by the same law from which they are exempt. At the same time the liberty given to the State and its instrumentalities by the statute enacted under the Constitution does not exempt them from honouring the Constitution itself. They continue to be ruled by Article 14. The validity of their actions in the field of landlord tenant relationship is available to be tested not only under the rent control legislation but under the Constitution.15 The Supreme Courthas struck down as discriminatory and unconstitutional a provision in the Andhra Pradesh Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1960, exempting all buildings constructed on or after August 26, 1957, from the operation of the Act. The Court said that the impugned provision was violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution (equality before law) as the \"continuance of this provision in the statute book will imply the creation of a privileged class of landlords without any rational basis.\" The Court said that \"the incentive to build which provided a reasonable classification for such class of landlords (when the Act was made in 1960) no longer exists by lapse of time in the case of the majority of such landlords.\" \"There is no reason why after all these years they (landlords who built their houses on or after August 26, 1957) should not be brought at par with other landlords who are subject to the restrictions imposed by the Act in the matter of eviction of tenants and control of rents.\" Exemption can however be granted to \"newly constructed buildings\" for a limited period of time. In this connection, the Court has said:.... \"what was once a non-discriminatory piece of legislation may in course of time become discriminatory.\" The incentive to build provides a rational basis for classification of landlords under Art.",

    "content": "of the Constitution and \"it is necessary in the national interest that there should be freedom from restrictions for a limited period Page 987 of time.\" Hence the State legislature may provide incentive to persons who want to build new houses as it serves a definite social purpose and to mitigate rigours to landlords who may have recently built houses for a limited period.16 In Mohinder Kumar v. State of Haryana, 17 the Supreme Court has held valid exemption of new buildings from rent control for ten years. The Tamil Nadu Rent Control Act was made inapplicable to tenants of residential buildings paying more than Rs. 400 per months as rent. Holding the provision bad under Art. 14, the Supreme Court has held that while tenants in non-residential buildings paying rent of more than Rs. 400 were protected, similar tenants in residential buildings were not. The Court saw no justification for such a classification.18 But, on the other hand, in several cases, the Supreme Court has justified greater protection being given to the tenants of commercial premises than those of residential premises.19 The reason is that commercial tenancy is much more valuable than a residential tenancy. A commercial tenancy has got distinct features and characteristics of its own different from that of a residential tenancy. Accordingly, all the grounds of eviction of a tenant of a residential premises may not be available for eviction of a tenant of commercial premises.20 For example, while bona fide necessity of the landlord may be a good ground to evict a tenant of a residential premises, the same ground may not be available under the relevant law for the eviction of a tenant from commercial premises. Similarly, the heirs of the statutory tenants of commercial premises may be better protected than those of residential premises. On the other hand, in Harbilas Rai Bansal v. State of Punjab, 21 the Supreme Court has expressed a different view. The Punjab Rent Act provided, to begin with, that a landlord could evict a tenant from commercial/residential property on the ground of his own bona fide personal need. But, then, the law was amended so that while a landlord could evict a tenant in residential property on the ground of his own bona fide need but not if the property was non-residential. The Supreme Courtruled that this differentiation between tenants of residential and non-residential properties was violative of Art.14. A tenant in a non-residential property could continue in possession for life and after his death his heirs could continue the tenancy. The Court ruled that any classification between tenants of residential and non-residential properties had no nexus with the object sought to be achieved by the Act in question. \"Tenants of both kinds of buildings need equal and same protection of the beneficial provisions of the Act. Neither from the objects and reasons of the Act nor from the provisions of the Act it is possible to discern any basis for the classification created by the Amendment.\" (e) FOREIGNERS The power of the Government of India to expel foreigners is absolute and unlimited and there is no provision in the Constitution fettering its discretion and the executive government has unrestricted right to expel a foreigner. So far as right to be heard is concerned, there cannot be any hard and fast rule about the manner in which a person concerned has to be given an opportunity to place his case. The deportation proceedings are not proceedings for prosecution where a man may be convicted or sentenced. The procedure under the foreigners Act and the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order 1964 is just, fair and reasonable and does not offend any Constitutional provision.22 It is open to the state to make a classification for conferring benefit on a specified class of employees e.g. pension Rules not being made applicable to casual employees.23 (f) CIVIL SERVICES In Mohan Kumar Singhania v. Union of India, 24 the Supreme Court has ruled that each of the various civil services, namely, I.A.S., I.F.S., I.P.S., Group A Services and Group B Services, is a 'separate and determinate' service forming a distinct cadre and that each of the Services is founded on intelligible differentia which on rational grounds distinguishes persons grouped together from those left out and that the differences are \"real and substantial\" having a \"rational and reasonable nexus\" to the \"objects sought to be achieved\". (g) LIFE INSURANCE Page 988 The Life Insurance Corporation, a statutory body, introduced a scheme of life insurance, which was open only to persons in government or semi-government service or of reputed commercial firms. This scheme was declared unconstitutional as being violative of Art. 14. LIC argued that this salaried group of lives formed a class with a view to identify health conditions. But the Supreme Court rejected the argument observing, \"The classification based on employment in government, semi-government and reputed commercial firms has the insidious and inevitable effect of excluding lives in vast rural and urban areas engaged in unorganised or self-employed sectors to have life insurance offending Art. 14 of the Constitution and socio-economic justice.\"25 (h) MISTAKE NOT TO BE REPEATED The Supreme Court has stated in Gursharan Singh26 that the guarantee of 'equality before law' is a positive concept. It cannot be enforced by a person in a negative manner. Therefore, if an illegality or irregularity is committed by the state in favour of a person or a group of persons, others cannot claim that the same irregularity or illegality be also committed in their favour on the principle of equality before law. Benefits extended to some persons in an irregular or illegal manner cannot be claimed by a citizen on the plea of equality as enshrined in Art. 14. If such claims are enforced, it will amount to continuance and perpetuation of an illegal procedure or order for extending similar benefits to others.",

    "content": "extended to some persons in an irregular or illegal manner cannot be claimed by a citizen on the plea of equality as enshrined in Art. 14. If such claims are enforced, it will amount to continuance and perpetuation of an illegal procedure or order for extending similar benefits to others. To base a claim on the concept of equality, the petitioner has to establish that his claim being just and legal, has been denied to him, while it has been extended to others and in this process there has been a discrimination. In the following case,27 the Supreme Court has observed: \"We fail to see how Art. 14 can be attracted in cases where wrong orders are issued in favour of others. Wrong orders cannot be perpetuated with the help of Art. 14 on the basis that such wrong orders were earlier passed in favour of some other persons and, therefore, there will be discrimination against others if correct orders are passed against them.\" The principle of equality enshrined in Art. 14 does not apply when the order relied upon is unsustainable in law and is illegal.28 In Chandigarh Administration v. Jagjit Singh, 29 the Supreme Court has stated: \"Generally speaking, the mere fact that the respondent authority has passed a particular order in the case of another person similarly situated can never be the ground for issuing a writ in favour of the petitioner on the plea of discrimination. The order in favour of the other person might be legal and valid or it might not be. That has to be investigated first before it can be directed to be followed in the case of the petitioner. If the order in favour of the other person is found to be contrary to law or not warranted in the facts and circumstances of his case, it is obvious that such illegal or unwarranted order cannot be made the basis of issuing a writ compelling the respondent authority to respect the illegality or to pass another unwarranted order.\" Merely because the concerned authority has passed one illegal/unwarranted order in favour of one person, it does not entitle the High Court to issue a writ compelling the authority to repeat that illegality over and over again. By refusing to direct the authority to repeat the illegality, the court is not condoning the earlier illegal act/order nor can such illegal order constitute the basis for a legitimate complaint of discrimination.30 Art. 14 does not countenance repetition of a wrong action to bring both wrongs at a par.31 A wrong judgment passed by a High Court under Art. 226 in favour of one person does not entitle another person to claim a similar benefit by invoking the doctrine of equality in his favour. Two wrongs do not make a right.32 (i) HARDSHIP Mere hardship is no ground to strike down a valid legislation.33 But the court has held that even if a law cannot be declared ultra vires on the ground of hardship, it can be so declared on the ground of total unreasonableness applying the Wednesbury \"unreasonableness\".34 Page 989 (j) RECOVERY OF LOANS A special machinery can be established for expeditious recovery of the loans advanced by the State or the State Financial Corporation. These loans are advanced to assist people financially to set up industries in the State so as to advance the well being of the people. If these loans are recovered expeditiously, fresh loans may be advanced to other persons for a similar purpose. These loans thus differ from the ordinary loans which are advanced for earning interest.35 (k) PERPETUATION OF ILLEGALITY It would be constitutionally immoral to perpetuate inequality among majority people of the country in the guise of protecting the Constitutional Rights of minorities and the backward and downtrodden.36 (l) PUBLIC SECTOR UNDERTAKING Favourable treatment shown to a public sector undertaking is not discriminatory. These undertakings stand in a different class altogether and the classification made between these enterprises and others is a valid one.37 As the Supreme Court has observed: \"... preference shown to ...... public sector undertakings being in public interest, will not be construed as arbitrary so as to give rise to a contention of violation of Article 14 of the Constitution.\"38 Similarly it has been held that preference shown by the State to cooperative societies does not violate Art. 14 as these societies play a positive and progressive role in the economy of our country.39 (m) DISCRIMINATION BY THE STATE IN ITS OWN FAVOUR Art. 14 does not outlaw discrimination between the state and a private individual because the two are not placed on the same footing. Thus, creation of a monopoly by the state in its favour will not be bad under Art. 14.40 Exemption granted to lands and buildings of the government, or a local authority, or a government sponsored housing board, from the Rent Control Act has been held valid as none of these has a profit motive and would not evict its tenants merely to unduly raise rents as private landlords usually do and thus their tenants are not similarly situated as those of the private individuals.41 Under the Limitation Act, government claims are barred after 60 years, whereas private claims are barred in a much shorter period. This distinction has been held valid because in the former case the loss falls on the community at large and also because government machinery works much slower than a private individual.42 Money due to the state in respect of its trading activities can be made recoverable as a public demand. It is not against Art. 14 to distinguish between the government as a banker and other bankers for purposes of recovery of money, for government dues are the dues of the entire community and, therefore, a law providing special facility to recover the same cannot be said to offend Art.",

    "content": "Government debts can be given priority over individual debts;44 special procedures can be laid down for eviction of unauthorised occupants of government premises as government property forms a class by itself;45 special provisions can be made for recovering debts due to the government or to a bank established with public funds as disinguished from private banks.46 Exemption granted to the State from payment of court-fees has been held valid because, in any case, the State has to bear the expense of the administration of civil justice.47 (n) TAXING STATUTES Art. 14 covers tax legislation as well. Tax laws do not fall outside the scope of Art. 14, and such laws must also pass the test of Art. 14. However, taxing statutes enjoy more judicial indulgence because picking and choosing within limits is inevitable in taxation. The principle of classification is applied somewhat liberally in case of a taxing statute. The legislature enjoys a great deal of latitude in the matter of classification of objects and purposes of taxation. The courts adopt a more tolerant attitude towards a tax law. Page 990 The courts assert that in view of the intrinsic complexity of fiscal adjustments of diverse elements, a legislature ought to be permitted a larger discretion and latitude in the matter of classification for taxing purposes.48 The rate of tax and objects to be taxed are to be determined by the Legislature and unless it is found to be so unreasonable, the court does not interfere with the latitude enjoyed by the Legislature in this behalf.49 On this point, the Supreme Court has observed in Khandige:50 \".... The courts, in view of the inherent complexity of fiscal adjustment of diverse elements, permit a larger discretion to the Legislature in the matter of classification, so long it adheres to the fundamental principles underlying the said doctrine. The power of the Legislature to classify is of \"wide range and flexibility\" so that it can adjust its system of taxation in all proper and reasonable ways.\" Again the Court has observed in Hoechst:51 \"When the power to tax exists, the extent of the burden is a matter for discretion of the law-makers. It is not the function of the court to consider the propriety or justness of the tax, or enter upon the realm of legislative policy. If the evident intent and general operation of the tax legislation is to adjust the burden with a fair and reasonable degree of equality, the constitutional requirements is satisfied.\" The reason for greater judicial tolerance shown towards a tax law is that taxation is not merely a source of raising money to defray government expenses but it is also a tool to reduce inequalities in society. Accordingly, while applying the doctrine of classification, the legislature is allowed much more freedom of choice in the matter of taxation vis-à-vis other types of laws. As no scheme of taxation is free of all discriminatory impact, a tax measure is struck down on the ground of discrimination under Art. 14 only on the ground of palpable arbitrariness applied in the context of the felt needs of the times and societal exigencies informed by experience. The tests of the vice of discrimination in a tax law are thus less rigorous.52 Parliament imposed expenditure tax on hotels where room charges were Rs. 400 or over per day for a unit of residential accommodation. Holding the Act valid against a challenge under Art. 14, the Supreme Court emphasized that having regard to the wide variety of diverse economic criteria that go into the formulation of a fiscal policy, the legislature enjoys a wide latitude in the matter of selection of persons, subject-matter, events, etc. for purposes of taxation.53 In the field of taxation, the Supreme Court has permitted the legislature to exercise an extremely wide discretion in classifying items for tax purposes, so long as it refrains from clear and hostile discrimination against particular persons or classes. A tax on purchasers of hides and skins only, and not on purchasers of other commodities, was held valid as there was 'no material on the record' to suggest that the purchasers of other commodities were similarly situated as those of hides and skins.54 A sales tax imposed on sales of virginia tobacco but not of country tobacco is not bad under Art. 14, for the former has certain features which distinguish it from the latter.55 A higher show tax on cinema houses with large seating accommodation and situated in fashionable, busy or rich localities than on small cinema houses containing less accommodation and situated in poor localities, is valid.56 Classification for purposes of income-tax with reference to the sources of income is valid.57 Differential rates of tax can be imposed on stage carriages and goods vehicles as the two belong to distinct categories.58 Levy of a higher grazing rate for animals belonging to the outsiders than on those belonging to the residents of the State is discriminatory as there is no rational basis for making such a distinction.59 Parliament enacted a law imposing expenditure tax at 10% ad valorem on 'chargeable expenses' incurred in hotels wherein room charges were Rs. 400 or over per day for a unit of residential accommodation. The Act was challenged under Art. 14. The argument was that there was no basis or intelligible differentia for discriminating between the levy of the tax on expenditure over food or drink provided by a hotel and the food and drink provided by a restaurant or eating house not situated in a hotel even though the cost of food or beverage could be higher than that on similar items in a taxed hotel. The Court held the tax valid arguing that \"the bases of classification cannot be said to be arbitrary or unintelligible nor as without a rational nexus with the object of the law.\" People with economic superiority would enjoy the services of a hotel having accommodation priced at Rs. 400/- or more per day.",

The Court emphasized the point that having regard to the wide variety of diverse economic criteria that go into the formulation of a fiscal policy legislature enjoys a wide latitude in the matter of selection of persons, subject-matter, events, etc. for purposes of taxation. The tests of the vice of discrimination in a taxing law are, accordingly, less rigorous.60 An entertainment tax was levied by the Tamil Nadu Government on admission to cinema theatres. Different rates were prescribed depending on the locality where the cinema was situated and also on the amenities provided therein. The tax was levied at a particular percentage of the rate of admission. This percentage varied from locality to locality. The tax was challenged under Art. 14, but the Supreme Court ruled that the classification made between the theatres was not an unreasonable one. The Court emphasized that the concept of \"Equality before law\" contained in Art. 14 envisages an \"obligation upon the State to bring about, through the machinery of law, a more equal society envisaged by the Preamble and Part IV of our Constitution.61 For, equality before law can be predicated meaningfully only in an equal society.\"62 In Andhra Pradesh, for levying a similar tax, the Legislature prescribed different rates of tax by classifying theatres into different classes, namely, air conditioned, air-cooled, ordinary, permanent, semi permanent, touring and temporary. The theatres were further categorised on the basis of the type of the local area in which they were situated. The levy was held valid as the legislature had sought to classify the cinema theatres taking into consideration the differentiating circumstances for the purpose of imposing the tax. The Court rejected the argument of the theatre owners that the classification was not perfect and that there should have been further classification amongst the theatres falling in the same class on the basis of the location of the theatre in each local area.63 To find out discrimination, what is decisive is not the phraseology of a statute but the impact and effect of the law. A law ex facie non-discriminatory may in effect operate unevenly on persons or property not similarly situated and thus offend the equality clause. Conversely, a law appearing to be discriminatory may not be so in actual operation.64 Just as a difference in the treatment of persons similarly situate leads to discrimination so also discrimination can arise if persons who are unequals, i.e., differently placed, are treated similarly. A law providing for equal treatment of unequal objects, transactions or persons would be condemned as discriminatory if there is absence of rational relation to the object intended to be achieved by the law. This proposition is illustrated by K.T. Moopil Nair v. State of Kerala, 65A land tax at a flat rate of Rs. 2 per acre was declared discriminatory as it made no reference to income, either actual or potential, from the land taxed. A flat rate of tax was imposed whether or not there was any income from the property. The Act in question did not have any regard to the quality of the land or its productive capacity and so levy of the tax at a flat rate was invalid. Lack of classification by the Act therefore created inequality. This was evident from the facts of the instant case, where the petitioner was required to pay a tax of Rs. 54,000 per year while the income from the land taxed came to Rs. 3,100 only. The tax was therefore characterised as discriminatory and confiscatory and hence bad under Art. 14. Following the Moopil Nair case, the Supreme Court in State of Andhra Pradesh v. Raja Reddy, 66declared void land revenue imposed at a flat rate on land without taking into account the quality or productivity of the soil. Moreover, the Act laid down no procedure to assess land revenue, and however, grievous the mistake made in the assessment, there was no way for the aggrieved party to get it corrected. No notice was prescribed and no opportunity was given to the assessee to question the assessment on his land. The Court emphasized that Art. 14 can be offenderd both when a statutory provision finds differences where there are none, or makes no difference where there is one. Even a tax law cannot introduce unreasonable discrimination between persons or property either by classification or lack of it. A tax on buildings on the 'floorage' basis (the rate of tax being determined by the floor area) on a sliding scale, whether the building be situated in a large industrial town or in an insignificant village, was held discriminatory under Art. 14 as the rate of tax did not depend upon the purpose for which the building was used, the nature of the structure, the town and locality in which the building was situated, the economic rent obtainable from the building, its cost and other related circumstances which might appropriately be taken into consideration in any rational system of taxation of buildings. No attempt was made at any rational classification in imposing the tax in question. Imposing a uniform tax on objects, persons or transactions Page 992 essentially dissimilar may result in discrimination.67 A tax on urban land was held invalid because of lack of classification which resulted in inequality and hostile discrimination.68 Kerala levied a tax at the rate of Rs. 50 per hectare on seven types of plantations. The tax was challenged on the ground of lack of classification. By a majority of 3 : 2, the Supreme Court upheld the tax.",

    "content": "a uniform tax on objects, persons or transactions Page 992 essentially dissimilar may result in discrimination.67 A tax on urban land was held invalid because of lack of classification which resulted in inequality and hostile discrimination.68 Kerala levied a tax at the rate of Rs. 50 per hectare on seven types of plantations. The tax was challenged on the ground of lack of classification. By a majority of 3 : 2, the Supreme Court upheld the tax. The majority found that the law sought to equalise the different plantations for purposes of taxability. Hidayatullah, C.J., speaking for the majority observed: \"... the burden of proving discrimination is always heavy and heavier still when a taxing statute is under attack....The burden is on a person complaining of discrimination. The burden is proving not possible 'inequality' but hostile 'unequal' treatment. This is more so when uniform taxes are levied.\" On the other hand, the minority held that tax was discriminatory as it was not related to productivity of land. For example, the average yields of the lands varied from 350 kgs to 1850 kgs of tea and so a uniform tax must result in inequality among tea-growers who formed one class.69 The minority view appears to be more rational in this case. Whenever power is delegated by the legislature for the purpose of levying taxes on a particular commodity or exempting some other commodity from taxation, a sort of classification is to be made. Such classification cannot be a product of blind approach by the administrative authorities on which the responsibility of delegated legislations is vested by the Constitution. A notification issued by a Taxing Department of a State which lacks a sense of reasonability because it is not able to strike a rational balance of classification between the items of the same category would be ultra vires Art. 14.70 The reasonableness of classification must be examined on the basis, that when the object of the taxing provision is not to tax the sale of certain chemical fertilizers included in the list which clearly points out that all the fertilizers with similar compositions must be included without excluding any other chemical fertilizer which has the same elements and, as such, there is no basis for differential treatment amongst the same class. The Court referred to Ayurveda Pharmacy case71 which had held that two vital items of the same category could not be discriminated against and where such a distinction is made between the items falling in the same category it should be done on a reasonable basis, in order to save such a classification being in contravention of Art. 14 of the Constitution.72 A classification on the basis of capacity to pay for purposes of taxation is valid. It is therefore permissible to levy a higher tax on those who are economically stronger than those who are weaker. \"The object of a tax is not only to raise revenue but also to regulate the economic life of the society.\"73 A flat rate tax may not be bad always. It is only in marginal cases when the impact of such a tax is glaringly discriminatory or expropriatory that it may be hit by Art. 14. Therefore, a tax of Re. 1 per bottle of foreign liquor (produced in India) is valid as it is levied at a conveniently flat rate with minimal effect on over-all price and it is easy to collect.74 A classification made to prevent evasion of tax and fraud on taxation may be held valid under Art. 14.75 The Central Government classified match manufacturing units into mechanised and non-mechanised units and levied a lower excise duty on the latter than on the former. It was argued that the non-mechanised category did not distinguish between stronger and weaker units and thus treated unequals as equals. Rejecting the contention, the courts held that a pertinent principle of differentiation linked to productive processes had already been adopted and further sub-classi-fication between strong and weak units in the same class could not be insisted upon with reference to Art. 14.76 Several State Legislatures enacted statutory provisions levying cesses/taxes on minerals. These provisions were invalidated by the Supreme Court on the ground that the power to impose these levies vested with Parliament and not the States. The State levies were at different rates. To protect the States from refunding the revenue collected from these levies, Parliament enacted an Act validating the State levies with retrospective effect. Page 993 This Act was challenged inter alia under Art. 14 on the ground that it imposed levies in different States at different rates. The Court held that there was no violation of Art. 14 by Parliament as there was historic justification for the law in question. Different States were imposing levies at different rates and to validate the State levies, Parliament had to adopt the very rates prevailing in the various States. \"It is really not a case where the Parliamentary enactment is creating the distinction or different treatment. Distinction and different treatment was already there over several decades; each State was prescribing its own rate on the same material... The Parliament has intervened and by enacting the impugned law in exercise of its undoubted power, validated the levy and all that flows from it. In such circumstances, there was no other way except to do what has actually been done\". When Parliament was re-enacting the very provisions prevalent in the States, it could not but adopt those very rates.77 Differentiation in taxation levied on intra-state and inter-State contract carriages was upheld by the Supreme Court in the following case,78 on the ground that \"in many factual ways the vehicles covered by two different permits do form a separate and distinct class\". The courts would not interfere with classification, \"which is the prerogative of the legislature\", so long as it was not arbitrary or unreasonable.",

    "content": "courts would not interfere with classification, \"which is the prerogative of the legislature\", so long as it was not arbitrary or unreasonable. The nexus of the classification with the object of taxation in the instant case lay in pubic interest--\"which is again within the realm of legislative wisdom unless tainted by perversity or absurdity\". The Supreme Court reiterated the proposition as regards the power of the State to tax that \"the State has a wide discretion in selecting the persons or objects it will tax and thus a statute is not open to attack on the ground that it taxes some persons or objects and not others.\" A very wide latitude is available to the legislature in the matter of classification of objects, persons and things for the purpose of taxation. (o) ECONOMIC AFFAIRS There is no such law that a particular commodity cannot have a dual fixation of price. Dual fixation of price based on reasonable classification of different types of customers has met with approval from the courts, e.g. Respondent coal company charging lower prices for supply of coal from core/linked sector industries while charging higher prices from appellants who did not belong to the core sector. The Court held that primary consideration for placing industries concerned in the core sector being their intrinsic importance to the economy of country and role which they play in nation building activities. Requirement of coal in the core sector is on the higher side either for captive power generation or for other uses for manufacturing operations. Any substantial increase in price of coal would have a substantial effect on cost of finished products of vital importance, and cost of services to the public. These factors legitimately call for a special treatment as far as these industries are concerned. For charging lesser prices or evolving a dual price policy it cannot be said that in such a case that equals are being treated unequally or that the classification does not rest on a rational basis. Moreover, respondent coal company is facing a heavy financial deficit having an accumulated loss of more than Rs.1000 crores. Decontrol of price was done with predominant object of enabling respondent and other coal companies which were in the red, to become solvent and profitable. An industrial company completely held by the Govt. (like respondent) cannot be denied right to keep in view the consideration of commercial expediency while formulating its policies in discharge of its functions. Though absolute and unfettered freedom cannot be granted to State owned companies, but a wide latitude and flexible approach should be conceded especially when price fixation has been taken out of the realm of statutory control.79 In judicial review, the court is neither concerned with the (economic) policy nor with the rates. But in appropriate proceedings it may enquire into the question, whether relevant considerations have gone in and extraneous/irrelevant considerations been kept out while determining the price. In case the legislature has laid down the pricing policy and prescribed the factors which should guide the determination of the price, then the Court will, if necessary, enquire into the question whether the policy and factors were present to the mind of the authorities specifying the price. The Court does not substitute its judgment for that of the legislature or its agent as to the matters within the province of either. The judicial enquiry is confined to the question whether the findings of facts are reasonably based on evidence and whether such findings are consistent with the laws of the land.80 Sugar dealers in Calcutta were permitted to keep a maximum stock of 3500 quintals of sugar whereas those in towns with population up to one lakh, only 250 quintals and in towns with less than one lakh population, only 100 quintals. Such a classification of dealers was held to be not arbitrary but based on reasonable classification and so not bad under Art. 14.81 Page 994 The agricultural debtors form a separate category because of their poverty, economic backwardness and miserable conditions. Therefore, a law enacted to give relief to agricultural indebtedness is not invalid.82 A law imposing a minimum sentence of six months' rigorous imprisonment on offenders guilty of selling adulterated food is not hit by Art. 14.83 When unequally placed persons are treated equally, Art. 14 is violated.84 By a Central law, the undertakings of 14 banks were acquired by the Central Government and these banks were prohibited from doing any banking business. This was held to be discriminatory as other banks could carry on banking business and new banks could be floated and there was thus no rational explanation for the prohibition on the 14 banks in question.85 The Special Bearer Bonds (Immunities and Exemptions) Act, 1981, providing for investment in bearer bonds was held valid vis-a-vis Art. 14 in R.K. Garg v. Union of India. 86The object of the Act being to unearth black money lying secreted, and to canalise the same into productive purposes, the classification made between those possessing black money and others could not be regarded as arbitrary or irrational. It was based on intelligible differentia having rational relation with the object of the Act. Only limited immunities had been granted to the holders of the bearer bonds. These are necessary to induce the holders of black money to invest in bearer bonds. In the instant case, the Supreme Court emphasized that the laws relating to economic activities should be viewed with greater indulgence than ordinary laws and economic laws may not be struck down merely on account of crudities and inequities inasmuch as such legislations are designed to take care of complex situations and complex problems which do not admit of solutions through any doctrinaire approach or straight-jacket formulae. In the words of the Court: \"Another rule of equal importance is that laws relating to economic activities should be viewed with greater latitude than laws touching civil rights such as freedom of speech, religion etc...",

    "content": "court should feel more inclined to give judicial deference to legislative judgment in the field of economic regulation than in other areas where fundamental human rights are involved.\" There is no Fundamental Right in a citizen to carry on trade or business in liquor.87 The State under its regulatory power has the power to prohibit absolutely every form of activity in relation to intoxicants such as its manufacture, storage, export, import, sale and possession. However, when the State decides to grant such right or privilege to others, the State cannot escape the rigour of Art. 14. In this connection, the Supreme Court has observed in Nandlal:88 \"But while considering the applicability of Art. 14 in such a case we must bear in mind that having regard to the nature of the trade or business the Court would be slow to interfere with the policy laid down by the State Government for grant of licences for manufacture and sale of liquor. The court would, in view of the inherently pernicious nature of the commodity allow a large measure of latitude to the State Government in determining its policy of regulating manufacture and trade in liquor. Moreover, the grant of licences for manufacture and sale of liquor would essentially be a matter of economic policy where the court would hesitate to intervene and strike down what the State Government has done unless it appears to be plainly arbitrary, irrational or mala fide\".89 (p) GEOGRAPHICAL DIFFERENTIATION Geographical considerations may form a valid basis of classification for purposes of legislation in appropriate cases. In this connection, the Supreme Court has recently observed in Clarence Pais v. Union of India90: \"Historical reasons may justify differential treatment of separate geographical regions provided it bears a reason and just relation to the matter in respect of which differential treatment is accorded. Uniformity in law has to be achieved, but that is a long drawn process.\" The State of Rajasthan passed an Act prescribing a procedure for fixing fair and equitable rent payable by the tenants in the Marwar region. It was challenged on the ground that it did not apply to the whole State. Page 995 Rejecting the objection, the Supreme Court stated that Art. 14 prohibits unequal treatment of persons similarly situated. The Act would be bad if it were established that conditions prevailing in other areas of the State were similar to those in Marwar where the Act applied. This was not proved. An Act could not be held discriminatory merely because it did not apply to the whole State.91 One uniform law need not operate throughout the State regarding any particular matter. If circumstances so warrant, a State can be divided into several zones and different laws regarding the same matter applied to these zones. Thus, Orissa can have two Acts to nationalise road transport, one applying to that part of the State which was previously British, and the other to that part which was previously princely, as the conditions in the two parts differ materially.92 With the States' Re-organisation in 1956, territories from one State became part of another State. To avoid any dislocation in the legal system, the States Re-organisation Act stipulated that the existing laws would continue in force in these areas. The result was that in some cases, different laws prevailed in different areas of a State on the same subject. This was held valid on the ground that \"differentiation arises from historical reasons; and a geographical classification based on historical reasons can be upheld as not being contrary to the equal protection clause in Art. 14.\"93 The Indian Income-tax Act provides for recovery of arrears of income-tax according to the land revenue recovery law prevalent in each State. These laws differ from State to State and prescribe different procedures, some harsher than others. It was argued that income-tax being a Union subject, the procedure for recovery of income-tax must be uniform throughout India, for to the Union all defaulters were alike and similarly situated, and thus prescribing different machinery from State to State created discrimination. The provision was held valid on the ground that to group the defaulters statewise was to classify them on a geographical basis and this was an intelligible differentia. To subject the defaulters to the same coercive process as has been devised by their State, on a consideration of local needs, could not be regarded as bereft of a reasonable nexus between the basis of classification and the object sought to be achieved by the Indian Income-tax Act.1 A law need not be applied to the whole State all at once. No discrimination arises if the law, to begin with, is applied to selected areas in the State.2 Under the Arms Act, an offence could be tried only after obtaining the sanction of the Central Government, but in the area North of the Ganga and Jamuna rivers, an offence could be tried without any such sanction. The distinction was held bad as it was based on an irrational factor. The differentiation between the area North of Ganga-Jamuna and the rest of the country had been made as a result of the political situation existing in 1857,viz., the largest opposition to the British Government had come from the talukedars in this area. But in the changed political situation of today, it was impossible to sustain any such distinction.3 Although geographical difference can be a basis of classification provided it had nexus with the object to be achieved, mere geographical classification cannot be sustained where the Act instead of achieving the object of legislation defeats the very purpose for which it has been made.4 (q) PROCEDURAL DIFFERENTIATION Art. 14 guarantees equal protection not only as regards substantive laws but procedural laws as well. Art. 14 condemns discrimination not only by a substantive law but also by a law of procedure.5 As the Supreme Court has observed:6 Art. 14 \"not only guarantees equal protection as regards substantive laws but procedural laws also come within its ambit.",

    "content": "14 condemns discrimination not only by a substantive law but also by a law of procedure.5 As the Supreme Court has observed:6 Art. 14 \"not only guarantees equal protection as regards substantive laws but procedural laws also come within its ambit. The implication of the Article is that all litigants similarly situated are entitled to avail themselves of the same procedural rights for relief, and for defence with like protection and without discrimination.\" It means that all litigants, similarly situated, are entitled to the same procedural rights for relief and for defence. This means that if special procedure is laid down for a class of people as distinguished from others, then the 'class' must be based on a rational differentia having a reasonable relation with the object sought to be achieved. Further, all in the same 'class' should be subjected to the same law; there cannot be selectivity within a class. If within the same class some are subjected to a more drastic procedure than others, then it is discriminatory and bad under Art. 14. If two laws apply to a Page 996 class, then the one which is more burdensome is discriminatory and so void under Art. 14. The above-mentioned principles can be illustrated by a few examples. A law in Jammu and Kashmir laying down a procedure, materially different from the ordinary criminal procedure, to try 'enemy agents' was held valid because the term 'enemy agents', as defined in the ordinance, constituted a clearly defined class. Creating a new offence, and providing a stringent procedure for its trial, do not give rise to discrimination as permissible classification under Art. 14 need not be of persons only; even offences of a serious nature may be treated as a class and tried in a way different from ordinary offences and dealt with by a drastic procedure without violating the equal protection clause.7 According to S. 27 of the Evidence Act, a statement made to a police officer by an accused in custody when it leads to the discovery of a fact is admissible in evidence. It was argued against the provision that it drew a distinction between statements made by persons in custody and those not in custody. The provision was however upheld because the classification between persons in custody and those not in custody in the context of admissibility of statements made by them concerning the off-ence charged was not arbitrary or artificial.8 Under S. Sections 178A of the Sea Customs Act, if goods like gold, diamonds, etc., are seized in the reasonable belief that they are smuggled goods, then the burden of proving that they are not smuggled goods is on the person from whose possession they have been seized. The provision was challenged as discriminatory, for under the ordinary law it is for the prosecution to establish its case, and not for the accused to prove his innocence. Nevertheless, the provision was held valid because it was designed to minimize smuggling; it applied to goods which could easily be smuggled, and the classification of goods was based on an intelligible differentia which had a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act,viz., to prevent smuggling.9 Under the Supreme Court Rules, while no security is required to be given for filing a writ petition under Art. 32 to enforce a fundamental right, a security has to be given for moving an application for reviewing an order already made on a writ petition. There is no discrimination involved here, for in a review petition, the Court is asked to re-open a matter which had already been closed after hearing the parties.10 The Punjab Municipalities Act, 1911, provides for removal of a member of a municipality after giving him a hearing under specified circumstances. It also provides for removal of a member of a municipality without a hearing. This is discriminatory, for while in one case hearing is to be given to the member concerned, it may not be given in the other cases.11 Differential treatment by way of a provision saving proceedings in execution and those pending execution has been held to be violating Art. 14.12 (r) LEGISLATION APPLICABLE TO A SINGLE PERSON A statute based on a reasonable classification does not become invalid merely because the class to which it applies consists of only one person. A single body or institution may form a class. A legislation specifically directed to a named person or body would be valid if, on account of some special circumstances, or reasons applicable to that person, and not applicable to others, the single person could be treated as a class by himself. The Act may however be bad if there are no special circumstances differentiating the person concerned from the rest, or if others having the same attributes are not covered by the Act. A restriction imposed by reason of a statute, can be upheld in the event it is found that the person to whom the same applies, forms a separate and distinct class and such classification is a reasonable one based on intelligible differentia having nexus with the object sought to be achieved.13 The contention that the institution Indian Council of World Affairs (ICWA) was singled out and though there were several other institutions run by societies or other organizations which were in the grip of more serious mismanagement and maladministration were not even touched and Parliament chose to legislate as to one institution only, did not find favour with the Court. Moreover, no other institution is named or particularized so as to be comparable with ICWA. In the ICWA case successive Parliamentary Committees found substance in Page 997 the complaints received that an institution of national importance was suffering from mismanagement and maladministration.",

    "content": "no other institution is named or particularized so as to be comparable with ICWA. In the ICWA case successive Parliamentary Committees found substance in Page 997 the complaints received that an institution of national importance was suffering from mismanagement and maladministration. The satisfaction of the President that emergent action was called for would not be vitiated merely because earlier the normal legislative process could not culminate in legislative enactments.14 A large cotton textiles mill employing a large labour force, closed down due to mismanagement. Parliament enacted an Act empowering the Central Government to appoint its own directors to take over the control and management of the company and its properties. A shareholder challenged the Act on the ground that since it singled out the company, it was discriminatory and bad under Art. 14. The Supreme Court by a majority declared the Act to be valid. Noting the background conditions leading to the passage of the Act in question, viz., mismanagement of the company's affairs which prejudicially affected production of an essential commodity (i.e., cloth) and had created serious unemployment among a section of the community, the Court pointed out that the facts with regard to the company were of an 'extraordinary' character and \"fully justified the company being treated as a class by itself\". Also, the petitioner failed to show that there were other companies in the same position as the company in question. The minority's view in the instant case however was different. Accepting the proposition that a legislation having a reasonable classification could not be held to be unconstitutional even if its application was found to affect only one person, it, nevertheless, held the Act in question bad as it made no classification; it selected a particular company and imposed liabilities on it. The minority agreed that though presumption should be made in support of the constitutional validity of a law, yet it held that in the instant case such a presumption was excluded as discrimination was writ large over the face of the Act.15 To put an end to protracted litigation which arose after the death of a rich jagirdar, the Hyderabad Legislature passed an Act allowing the claims of a few, and dismissing those of the other claimants. The Act was held invalid on the ground that it denied to a few persons a right to enforce their claims in a court and thus discriminated them from the rest of the community in respect of a valuable right which 'the law secures to them all'. The only purpose of the legislation was to end certain private disputes but that did not furnish any rational basis for the discrimination made. Continuance of a dispute even for a long period of time between rival claimants to the property of a private person is not such an unusual circumstance as to invest a case with special or exceptional features and make it a class by itself justifying its differentiation from all other cases of succession disputes.16 The principle of the above case was again applied in Ram Prasad Sahi v. State of Bihar .17 The court of wards granted a lease of land to the appellant. Thinking it to be against law, the Bihar Legislature enacted legislation to cancel this particular lease. Holding the Act void, the Supreme Court stated that the dispute was a legal dispute pure and simple between two private parties. What the Legislature had done was to single out a certain individual and deny him the rights which every Indian had to have his case adjudicated upon by a judicial tribunal according to law. The presumption of constitutionality of a legislative enactment, would not assist the State when on the face of a Statute there is no classification at all, and no attempt has been made to select any individual or group with reference to any differentiating attribute peculiar to that individual or group and not possessed by others. A special law passed for Shri Jagannath Temple was held valid for the temple held a unique position amongst the Hindu temples and so it could be given a special treatment.18Special provisions can be made for each university as each university is a class by itself. Art. 14 does not require that provisions of every University Act must always be the same.19 The Prime Minister is allowed the use of an Indian Air Force aircraft for non-official purposes (including election) but not so the leaders of other political parties. This is not discriminatory because in view of the P.M.'s status and duties, he is a class by himself. It is necessary to ensure his personal safety and enable him to discharge official business promptly so that national interests may not suffer.20 A law providing for taking over of Auroville by government does not infringe Art. 14 as the Auroville institution has a uniqueness of its own.21 In the same category would fall a law made applicable to a few specified objects and persons. A law nationalising twelve specified sugar mills in the State of Uttar Pradesh was held valid as these mills were in intolerable economic condition.22 Page 998 A single institution is capable of being treated as a class by itself if there are special circumstances or reasons which are applicable to that institution. Moreover, it is clear from the language of Entries 62 and 63 that there can be legislation in respect of a single institution.23 A retired member of the State Electricity Board was appointed as its Chairman in 1982 for five years. Thereafter, his appointment was further extended for five years. Thus, he was to remain in office up to 1992. With the elections to the State Legislative Assembly of Himachal Pradesh, a new Chief Minister came in power in 1990. Before the respondent's appointment could come to an end, the State Government promulgated an ordinance fixing the age of retirement for members and the Chairman of the Board at 65.",

With the elections to the State Legislative Assembly of Himachal Pradesh, a new Chief Minister came in power in 1990. Before the respondent's appointment could come to an end, the State Government promulgated an ordinance fixing the age of retirement for members and the Chairman of the Board at 65. The ordinance was to apply not only to future appointees but also to the present incumbents in the Board. The respondent-Chairman of the Board challenged the constitutional validity of the ordinance (which later became an Act of the State Legislature) under Art. 14, as he had to retire from the chairmanship of the Board on reaching the age of 65 years but before his tenure came to an end. The High Court quashed the notification retiring the chairman issued under the Ordinance on the ground that the provision fixing the age of retirement could apply only prospectively and not to the present incumbents in office. On appeal by the State Government, the Supreme Court reversed the High Court and, after an exhaustive review of the case-law, upheld the validity of the Ordinance in question.24 The Court ruled that no one could quarrel with the desirability of the policy that a terminal point of time be provided beyond which a chairman and members of the State Electricity Board must cease to hold office by operation of law. The law is in general terms. The fact that it applies to one person at the moment does not make it invalid. Art. 14 does not come in the way of a legislature enacting a law applicable to one single person if there is reasonable classification. In the words of the Court:25 \"The possibility of this legislation applying to one or more persons exists in principle. The fact that only one individual came to be affected cannot render the legislation arbitrary as violative of Art. 14. This is because S. 3 is in general terms and the incidents of its applying to one individual does not render the legislation invalid.\" The Court also pointed out that the courts have always refrained from attributing mala fides to the Legislature.26 The Bihar Legislature enacted an Act to nationalise institutions fulfilling certain criteria. The programme for nationalisation was to be carried out in phases. Under the Act immediately only one institution was taken over. Accordingly, the Schedule to the Act in question mentioned only one institution for take-over, but there was a provision in the Act to amend the Schedule by adding more institutions. The Supreme Courtheld the Act valid in Lalit Narayan Mishra Institute of Economic Development & Social Change, Patna v. State of Bihar, 27 on the ground that no question of singling one institution arose. The Court refused to accept the argument that a law in general terms but affecting only one person at the time becomes a single person's legislation and thus violates Art. 14. The Court observed: \"When nationalisation has to be done in a phased manner, all the institutions cannot be taken over at a time. The nationalisation in a phased manner contemplates that by and by the object of nationalisation will be taken over.\" Consequent upon the Bhopal Gas Disaster, Parliament enacted the Bhopal Gas Disaster (Processing of Claims) Act, 1985. Under this Act, the Central Government took over the exclusive right of representing and acting on behalf of every victim for claiming compensation from the concerned multinational corporation. In place of the victims, the Central Government became entitled to file suits against the company for compensation. The validity of the Act was challenged on two main grounds, viz., (i) Could Parliament enact such a law? (ii) Was the law not discriminatory under Art. 14? The Supreme Court upheld the law on both these grounds in Charan Lal Sahu v. Union of India .28The Court ruled that the Act in question was passed in recognition of the right of the sovereign to act as parens patriae. In the words of Sabyasachi Mukharji, C.J.:29 \"But there is no prohibition or inhibition, in our opinion, conceptually or jurisprudentially, for Indian State taking over the claims of the victims or for the State acting for the victims as the Act has sought to provide....\" Page 999 The Court also ruled that the Act was not discriminatory as the victims formed a distinct class having several distinguishing marks deserving special treatment, e.g., many of the victims of the tragedy could not have pursued the legal remedies on their own pitted as they were against a multinational and a big Indian corporation; the victims became exposed to a contingent of foreign contingency lawyers who descended on the scene. Again, in the words of Sabyasachi Mukharji, C.J.:30 \"....the claimants and victims can legitimately be described as a class by themselves different and distinct, sufficiently separate and identifiable to be entitled to special treatment for effective, speedy, equitable and best advantageous settlement of their claims. There indubitably is differentiation. But this differentiation is based on a principle which has rational nexus with the aim intended to be achieved by its differentiation. The disaster being unique in its character in the recorded history of industrial disasters and situated as the victims were against a mighty multinational with the presence of foreign contingency lawyers looming on the scene, in our opinion, there were sufficient grounds for such differentiation and different treatment. In treating the victims of the gas leak disaster differently and providing them a procedure which was just, fair, reasonable and which was not unwarranted or unauthorized by the Constitution, Art. 14 is not breached.\" (s) TWO LAWS If there are two laws covering a situation, one more drastic than the other, there is the danger of discrimination if the Administration has a discretion to apply any of these laws in a given case.",

    "content": "treating the victims of the gas leak disaster differently and providing them a procedure which was just, fair, reasonable and which was not unwarranted or unauthorized by the Constitution, Art. 14 is not breached.\" (s) TWO LAWS If there are two laws covering a situation, one more drastic than the other, there is the danger of discrimination if the Administration has a discretion to apply any of these laws in a given case. Of the two persons placed in similar situation, one may be dealt with under the drastic law and the other under the softer law. To minimise any chance of such discrimination, the courts insist that the drastic law should lay down some rational and reasonable principle or policy to regulate administrative discretion as to its application. If the drastic law fails to do so, then it will be void under Art. 14. This proposition was applied by the Supreme Courtbefore 1974. To evict a person from unauthorised occupation of public premises, a Punjab Act provided for a summary procedure. The collector had not two choices; he could either himself order eviction under the special law, or could file an ordinary suit in a court for eviction under the general law. The Punjab law was declared void under Art. 14 because being a drastic law it laid down no policy to guide the collector's choice as to which law to follow in what cases; the matter was left to his unguided discretion and so there could be discrimination within the same class inter se, viz., unauthorised occupants of public premises.31 A logical consequence of this ruling was the amendment of the general law to provide that no court would have jurisdiction to entertain any suit in respect of eviction of unauthorised occupants of public premises. With this amendment the law became valid for now only one procedure was available to evict unauthorised occupants. The procedure by way of suit was no longer available, and therefore, the vice of discrimination disappeared.32 The Supreme Court reconsidered the matter in Maganlal Chhagganlal v. Greater Municipality .33 Here was involved the question of the validity of a Bombay Act which was pari passuwith the earlier Punjab Act declared invalid in the Northern India case. The Supreme Court felt worried by the fact that the argument based on the availability of two procedures, one more onerous than the other and, therefore, discriminatory, should have led to the apparently harsher procedure becoming the rule and resort to ordinary civil courts being barred. The Court wondered as to \"who benefits by resort to the ordinary civil courts being barred.\" The Court found it difficult to reconcile itself to the position that the mere possibility of resort of the civil court should make invalid a procedure which would otherwise be valid. Therefore, Northern India was now overruled, and the Bombay Act was upheld. The proposition regarding discriminatory procedures was rephrased as follows: where a statute providing for a more drastic procedure different from the ordinary procedure covers the whole field covered by the ordinary procedure, without any guidelines as to the class of cases in which either procedure is to be resorted to, the statute will be hit by Art. 14. Even there, a provision for appeal may cure the defect. Further, if in such cases from the preamble and surrounding circumstances, as well as the provisions of the statutes themselves explained and amplified by affidavits, necessary guidelines could be inferred, the statute will not be hit by Art. 14. Then again, where the statute itself covers only a class of cases, the statute will not be bad. The fact that in such cases the executive will choose which cases are to be tried under the special Page 1000 procedure will not affect the validity of the statute. Therefore, the Court held that the argument that the mere availability of two procedures will vitiate one of them, that is the special procedure, is not supportable. Applying the proposition in the instant case, the Court held that the statute in question lays down the purpose behind it, i.e. speedy eviction of unauthorised occupants of government premises. This provides sufficient guidance to the authorities in whom the power is vested. It would be extremely unreal to hold that an officer would resort to the dilatory court proceedings in any case when he has at his disposal a quick procedure. The provisions of the Act \"cannot be struck down on the fanciful theory that power would be exercised in such an unrealistic fashion\". The fact that the Legislature considered that the ordinary procedure is inefficient or ineffective in evicting unauthorised occupants of government property, and therefore provided a special procedure for it, is a clear guidance for the authorities charged with the duty of evicting unauthorised occupants. In addition, the Court also held that the difference between the ordinary court procedure and the special procedure was not so unconscionable as to attract the vice of discrimination. Under the special procedure, there was a provision for the concerned person to be heard and represented by a lawyer.34 \"After all Art. 14 does not demand a fanatical approach.\" The Court explained Maganlal later in Iqbal Singh35 by saying that mere availability of two procedures would not justify the quashing of a provision as being violative of Art. 14. What is necessary to attract the inhibition of Art. 14 is that there must be \"substantial and qualitative differences\" between the two procedures so that one is really and substantially more drastic than the other. Thus, as a result of Maganlal, judicial attitude towards differential procedures has become very tolerant.36 Under S. 5(1)(a) of the Minimum Wages Act, the government was required to appoint a committee representing all interests to hold a detailed enquiry regarding the concerned employment before advising the government in the matter of fixing minimum wages. UnderS. 5(1)(b), the government could itself publish proposals for minimum wages and give two months time to the affected persons to make representations.",

UnderS. 5(1)(b), the government could itself publish proposals for minimum wages and give two months time to the affected persons to make representations. S. 5 was challenged as discriminatory on the ground that the procedure under (a) was more advantageous to the employers than under (b) as their representatives on the committee could have a better say, and there was no guidance given to the government as to when it should follow which procedure. The Court rejected the challenge saying that the purpose of both procedures was to collect necessary data concerning an employment; the advice of the committee in (a) was not binding on the government, the government could adopt either of the procedures depending upon whether it has sufficient data or not concerning an employment to enable it to fix minimum wages and so there was no discrimination.37 Under the Bombay Town Planning Act, 1954, land could be acquired by following a procedure less favourable, and paying less compensation, than the Land Acquisition Act. It was argued that the existence of two laws for acquiring land, one less favourable than the other, was discriminatory under Art. 14. But theSupreme Court rejected the contention in Prakash Amichand Shah v. State of Gujarat. 38The Court ruled that while the State could acquire property under the Land Acquisition Act, the local authority working under the PlanningAct could do so only under that Act. There was no option to the local authority to resort to one or the other of the alternative methods which result in acquisition. Also, since the acquisition under the Town Planning Act was for a particular purpose, the Actcould provide for payment of compensation for such acquisition and it was not necessary to pay compensation under the Land Acquisition Act. The Court thus found that there was no denial of equal protection of laws or the equality before the law in the instant case. But when two laws covering the same matter differ on substantive points, the harsher law may still be held invalid under Art. 14. When there existed two legal provisions for acquisition of land for a public purpose, lower compensation being payable under the one law than under the other, the drastic law was held bad because there was no classification to whom it would apply and the State could give one owner different treatment from the other equally situated.39 (t) SPECIAL COURTS In State of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar, 40 was involved a Bengal law permitting setting up of special courts for the 'speedier trial' of such 'offences', or 'classes of offences' or 'cases', or 'classes of cases', as the Page 1001 State Government might direct by a general or special order. These courts were to follow a procedure less advantageous to the accused in defending himself than the procedure followed by the ordinary criminal courts. The Act was held invalid as it made no reasonable classification, laid down \"no yardstick or measure for the grouping either of persons or of cases or of offences\" so as to distinguish them from others outside the purview of the Act. The government had the power to pick out a case of a person and hand it over to the special tribunal while leaving the case of another person similarly situated to be tried by the ordinary criminal courts. It gave 'uncontrolled authority' to the executive 'to discriminate'. The necessity of 'speedier trial' was held to be too vague, uncertain and indefinite criterion to form the basis of a valid and reasonable classification. On the other hand, in Kathi Raning Rawat v. Saurashtra, 41 a provision practically similar to the one involved in the Anwar Alicase was held valid because the Court found that a policy was stated in the preamble to the Act, and that the government was expected to select such offences, classes of offences and classes of cases for trial in special courts as were calculated to affect public safety, maintenance of public order, etc. Comparing the above two cases, it would appear that the main difference in the terms of the statutes, which resulted in different judicial verdicts as to their validity, was that the preamble to the Saurashtra Act was more elaborately worded than that to the Bengal Act. While the term 'speedier trial' used in the Bengal Act to set up special courts was held to be indefinite, the words 'public safety, etc.' in the preamble to the Saurashtra Act were held to be more definite and as giving a guiding principle to control administrative discretion. In essence, therefore, the difference would appear to be more of a drafting nature rather than of substance.42 Though the principle that law should lay down the policy if discretion to classify is vested by it in the executive, and that the executive cannot be given an uncontrolled authority to differentiate, was applied in both cases, yet difference arose in its application to specific circumstances. However, in the Saurashtra law the provision authorising the government to pick out any individual 'case' for trial by a special court was held invalid as being discriminatory. The government could specify a 'class' of cases, offences or persons for trial by special courts, but it could not claim a power to send a single, specific 'case' out of a class to a special court for trial. The principle laid down in the above cases has been reiterated and applied in several other cases pertaining to special courts, though the result reached by the courts may not always appear to be quite satisfactory.",

    "content": "principle laid down in the above cases has been reiterated and applied in several other cases pertaining to special courts, though the result reached by the courts may not always appear to be quite satisfactory. In Kedar Nath v. State of West Bengal, 43 the law setting up special courts mentioned the offences triable by them but gave a discretion to the government to allot cases for trial to these courts. Two questions were raised for the consideration of the Supreme Court: (i) Did the law disclose any reasonable classification as to the offences mentioned ? (ii) Was the discretion left with the government to select cases for trial by special courts valid? The Court answered both the questions in the affirmative. As regards the first, it held that the types of offences mentioned in the Act were those which were widely prevalent during wartime and the policy was clear in the Act. It should however be noted that the Act in question contained no specific words to define the policy. The Court discovered the underlying policy by its own process of rationalization. On the second question, the argument that the government could make a discriminatory choice among persons charged with the same offence, submitting one case for trial to a special court and leaving the other for trial by an ordinary court, and thus discriminate within the same class, was rejected on the ground that the standards, policy and purpose of the Act were laid down in clear terms, and the administrative authority \"is expected to select the cases to be brought before the courts in fulfilment of that policy\". So far as the power to refer specific cases was sustained, the Kedar Nath case goes beyond the Saurashtra case mentioned above, but a subtle difference between the situations in the two cases may be noted: whereas the Saurashtra law made no classification of offences itself and left the whole matter to the executive subject to the policy statement in its preamble, the law in the Kedar Nath case itself made the classification of offences for trial by special courts, and subject to this classification, power to refer specific Page 1002 cases was conferred on the executive. Nevertheless, by its holding in the Kedar Nath case, the Court did dilute to some extent the principle it evolved in the Saurashtra case,44 for the government could pick and choose individual cases for trial by special courts. In August, 1978, the President made a reference to the Supreme Court under Art. 143(1) of the Constitution,45 seeking the Court's opinion on the constitutional validity of the Special Courts Bill proposing the setting up of special courts for speedy trial of offences committed by the holders of high public and political offices during the emergency of 1975-77. The proposed court was to be presided over by a sitting or retired High Court Judge to be appointed by the Central Government in consultation with the Chief Justice of India, and the accused could appeal to the Supreme Court against the verdict of such a court. The Supreme Court ruled that Parliament could make the law in question under entries 11A of List III and entry 77 of List I,46 and that it did not infringe Art. 14 as the classification provided for by the Bill was valid. \"The promulgation of emergency is not and cannot be a matter of normal occurrence in a nation's life, and \"offences alleged to have been committed during the period of emergency constitute a class by themselves and so do the persons who are alleged to have utillised the high public or political offices by them as a cover or opportunity for the purpose of committing those offences.\"47 The Court also invoked Art. 21 to assess the fairness of the procedure provided for in the Bill--this aspect is discussed later.48 The above-mentioned bill was enacted as the Courts Act, 1979 with one major change. Originally it was confined only to the trial of offences committed during the emergency, but, in Parliament, its scope was expanded so as to provide for setting up of special courts for trial of offences committed by those who held high \"public or political offices\" for all time to come. The Act was thus envisaged to be a permanent measure instead of being confined only to the emergency. The Act was upheld by the Supreme Court in State (Delhi Administration) v. V.C. Shukla, 49against challenge under Art. 14. The Court said that the main object of the Act was to provide for the speedy trial of certain class of offences, viz., offences committed by person holding high public or political offices as a trust. Such persons have been placed in a separate class. For maintaining democracy, administrative efficiency and purity, it is necessary that when such persons commit serious abuse of power and are guilty of a breach of trust reposed in them, they form a special class of offenders. Quick disposal of such cases is necessary, for if such cases are allowed to have their normal, leisurely, span before normal courts, then the whole purpose in launching them may be frustrated. The term 'high public or political office' is not vague; it bears a clear connotation as it means persons holding top positions wielding large powers. (u) UNREASONABLE LAWS As has been explained by Bhagwati, J., in Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab, 50 Rule of law which permeates the entire fabric of the Indian Constitution excludes arbitrariness. \"Wherever we find arbitrariness or unreasonableness there is denial of rule of law.\" Art. 14 enacts primarily a guarantee against arbitrariness and inhibits state action, whether legislative or executive, which suffers from the vice of arbitrariness. \"Every state action must be non-arbitrary and reasonable. Otherwise, the court would strike it down as invalid.\" This new dimension of Art. 14 transcends the classificatory principle. Art. 14 is no longer to be equated with the principle of classification.",

Otherwise, the court would strike it down as invalid.\" This new dimension of Art. 14 transcends the classificatory principle. Art. 14 is no longer to be equated with the principle of classification. It is primarily a guarantee against arbitrariness in state action and the doctrine of classification has been evolved only as a subsidiary rule for testing whether a particular state action is arbitrary or not. If a law is arbitrary or irrational it would fall foul of Art. 14. As an example, it has been held that any penalty disproportionate to the gravity of the misconduct would be violative of Art. 14.51 But controlled discretion exercisable according to a policy for a purpose clearly enunciated by a statute does not suffer from the vice of conferment of unrestricted discretion.52 A statutory provision providing for payment of compensation for the land acquired by the State from a person, in several annual instalments instead of one lump sum, is unreasonable. The Supreme Court has argued that the owner of the land would require compensation in lieu of land forthwith to re-establish himself by purchasing another piece of land and, therefore, compensation ought to be paid in one lump sum.53 But section 2(6)of the West Bengal Sales Tax Act, 1994 which requires the transporter to disclose the name of Page 1003 the consignor or consignee was not oppressive, irrelevant or arbitrary. Moreover for the purpose of such disclosure no special proforma is mandatory nor any machinery required to effectuate the provision.54 A mere hardship cannot be a ground for striking down a valid legislation unless it is held to be suffering from the vice of discrimination or unreasonableness.55 The Court has, however, pronounced a self imposed restraint that ordinarily it will not determine the merits of the legislation and arrive at a conclusion that it is arbitrary violating Art. 14. The Court has pointed out that \"inquisitorial inquiry\" is beyond the province of judicial review.56 Qualifying the word \"ordinarily\" implies that in certain situations the Court might consider the merits. The Court has pointed out in Kerala Scheduled Tribes case that there is a presumption that the ground realities are known to the State, and, therefore, \"if anybody raises a contrary contention it would be for him to bring on record sufficient material to lead the Court to arrive at a conclusion that \"State's action was arbitrary\".57 A law which was justified at the time of its enactment may, with the passage of time, become arbitrary and unreasonable with the change in circumstances. In Motor General Traders v. State of Andhra Pradesh,58 the Supreme Court has observed: \"What was once a perfectly valid legislation may, in course of time, become discriminatory and liable to challenge on the ground of its being violative of Art. 14.\" In Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 59 the Supreme Court has observed that \"restriction valid under one circumstance may become invalid in changed circumstances\". A provision not unconstitutional at the commencement of the Constitution can be rendered unconstitutional by later developments and thinking such as gender equality.60 Under the Bombay Rent Restriction Act, rents of premises were frozen at the level of 1st September, 1940. The Supreme Court declared the provision to be unreasonable and arbitrary and violative of Art. 14 in the year 1998 in view of so much inflation in the country since 1940.61 The Bar Council made a rule debarring persons aged above 45 years from enrolment as an advocate. The Supreme Court declared the rule to be discriminatory, unreasonable and arbitrary and thus violative of the principle of equality enshrined in Art. 14.62 Reservation by institutional preference is not violative of Art. 14 so long as it is reasonable and reasonableness has to be judged from a pragmatic point of view having regard to changed circumstances and practical realities.63 Merely because an appeal is not provided in a statute, would not by itself render a statute constitutionally invalid. However, if no appeal is provided for under a statute, an aggrieved party will still have the remedy of approaching the High Courts and Supreme Court in exercise of its power of Judicial review. Hence S. 3 Maharashtra Act. 17 of 1986 read with S. 9 Maharashtra Act 15 of 1987 abolishing appeals from original or appellate jurisdiction, was constitutionally invalid.64 D. ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRETION & ART. 14 A common tendency in modern democracies is to confer discretionary power on the government or administrative officers. The power is usually couched in very broad phraseology and gives a large area of choice to the administrator concerned to apply the law to actual factual situations. In order to ensure that discretion is properly exercised, it is necessary that the statute in question lays down some norms or principles according to which the administrator has to exercise the discretion. Many a time the statutes do not do this and leave the administrator free to exercise his power according to his judgment. This creates the danger of official arbitrariness which is subversive of the doctrine of equality. To mitigate this danger, the courts have invoked Art. 14. In course of time, Art. 14 has evolved into a very meaningful guarantee against any action of the Administration which may be arbitrary, discriminatory or unequal.65 Page 1004 This principle manifests itself in the form of the following propositions: (1) A law conferring unguided and unrestricted power on an authority is bad for arbitrary power is discriminatory. (2) Art. 14 illegalises discrimination in the actual exercise of any discretionary power. (3) Art. 14 strikes at arbitrariness in administrative action and ensures fairless and equality of treatment.",

    "content": "CONFERRING ABSOLUTE DISCRETION Proposition (1), stated above, envisages that a law conferring absolute or uncontrolled discretion on an authority negates equal protection of law because such power can be exercised arbitrarily so as to discriminate between persons and things similarly situated without reason.66 As Bhagwati, J., has observed: \"The law always frowns on uncanalised and unfettered discretion conferred on any instrumentality of the State.\"67 Where power granted is open to use disproportionate to purpose to be achieved is invalid in the absence of guidelines or principles or norms which are 'essential' for exercise of such power.68 The Court can veto any conferment of discretionary power on an authority if it is too broad, sweeping or uncanalised. The Supreme Court has laid down the applicable principle in the following words in Naraindas:69 \" Article 14 ensures equality before law and strikes at arbitrary and discriminatory state action.... If power conferred by statute on any authority of the State is vagrant and unconfined and no standards or principles are laid down by the statute to guide and control the exercise of such power, the statute would be violative of the equality clause, because it would permit arbitrary and capricious exercise of power, which is the antithesis of equality before law\". In Sudhir Chandra,70 the Supreme Court has observed: \"... Our Constitution envisages a society governed by rule of law. Absolute discretion uncontrolled by guidelines which may permit denial of equality before law is the antithesis of rule of law. Absolute discretion not judicially reviewable inheres the pernicious tendency to be arbitrary and is therefore violative of Art. 14. Equality before law and absolute discretion to grant or deny benefit of the law are diametrically opposed to each other and cannot co-exist.\" It means that the legislature cannot validly enact a provision conferring naked or arbitrary power on the Administration to be exercised by it in its absolute discretion. No law ought to confer excessive discretionary power on any authority. The court can veto conferment of discretionary power on an authority if it finds it to be naked or arbitrary. S.73 of the Stamp Act, 1899 (as applicable in the Andhra Pradesh) has been held to suffer from the vice of excessive delegation, since (i) there were no guidelines as to the persons who may be authorized by the Collector, and (ii) there was no requirement of reasons being recorded by the Collector or the person authorized for his belief necessitating search, and (iii) the power of impounding documents could be exercised without giving notice or a chance to make good the deficit stamp duty, except in case of documents in custody of a bank (no reasons having being given for making the distinction), and the power to adjudicate upon need for impounding documents in all cases being vested in the person authorized. A discretionary power may not necessarily be a discriminatory power but where a statute confers a power on an authority to decide matters of moment without laying down any guidelines or principles or norms, the power has to be struck down as being violative of Article 14. The A.P. Amendment permits inspection being carried out by the Collector by having access to the documents which are in private custody i.e. custody other than that of a public officer. According to the Court it is clear that this provision empowers invasion of the home of the person in whose possession the documents \"tending\" to or leading to the various facts stated in Section 73 are in existence. Section 73 being one without any safeguards as to the probable or reasonable cause or reasonable basis or materials violates the right to privacy both of the house and of the person. Under the garb of the power conferred by Section 73 the person authorized may go on rampage searching house after house i.e. residences of the persons or the places used for the custody of documents. The possibility of any wild exercise of such power may be remote, but then on the framing of Section 73 the Page 1005 possibility cannot be ruled out. Any number of documents may be inspected, may be seized and may be removed and at the end the whole exercise may turn out to be an exercise in futility. The exercise may prove to be absolutely disproportionate to the purpose sought to be achieved. A reasonable nexus between stringency of the provision and the purpose sought to be achieved must exist71 The rationale underlying this proposition is that unbridled discretionary power may degenerate into arbitrariness, or may result in discrimination and, thus, contravenes Art. 14 which bars discrimination.72 To be valid, discretionary power ought to be hedged by policy, standards, guidelines or procedural safeguards to regulate its exercise otherwise the court may declare a provision conferring sweeping powers on the Administration as void. Bhagwati, J., has enunciated the principle in Maneka Gandhi73 as follows: \"... when a statute vests unguided and unrestricted power in an authority to affect the rights of a person without laying down any policy or principle which is to guide the authority in exercise of this power, it would be affected by the vice of discrimination since it would leave it open to the Authority to discriminate between persons and things similarly situated.\" The above-mentioned principle is often invoked by the courts to assess the validity of laws conferring discretionary power. There is voluminous case-law in this area, but only a few illustrations may be given here to denote how the courts apply the principle in practice.",

    "content": "fuller discussion on this topic falls appropriately in the realm of Administrative Law.74In the context of the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971, theSupreme Courthas held that the initiation of proceedings under the Act must be as a last resort and the doctrine of proportionality should be applied to find out whether the power has been reasonably exercised.75 A statutory provision authorising the State Government, if it considers it necessary or expedient, to requisition by a written order any movable property and pay such compensation to the owner thereof as it may determine, is bad as it confers uncontrolled power on the government. There are no guidelines in the law regarding the object or purpose for which the government could requisition any movable property; there is no requirement that the property can be requisitioned only for a public purpose.76 A regulation made by Air India International, a statutory corporation, fixed the normal age of retirement of air hostesses at 35 years but authorised the managing director to extend the same to 45 years at his option subject to other conditions being satisfied. The regulation was held bad as it armed the managing director with uncanalized and unguided discretion to extend the age of retirement of any air hostess. No guidelines, principles or norms were laid down subject to which the power was to be exercised.77 Nor was there any procedural safeguard available to an air hostess who was denied extension. S. 6(4)of the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, authorised the State Government to remit an order of a labour tribunal for reconsideration of the adjudicating authority and that authority was to submit the award to the government after reconsideration. TheSupreme Court noted that S. 6(4) did not require the Government to hear the parties before remitting the award to the concerned adjudicating authority, the Government was not required to give reasons for remitting the award; the Government was not required to inform the authority the specific points on which it was to reconsider the award. In B.B. Rajwanshi v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 78 the Supreme Court declared S. 6(4) unconstitutional under Art. 14. The Court observed: \"The provision cannot be upheld in the absence of necessary statutory guidelines for the exercise of the power conferred by it having regard to the fact that the proceeding before the labour court or the industrial tribunal is in the nature of quasi-judicial proceeding where parties have adequate opportunity to state their respective cases, to lead evidence and make all their submissions.\" S. 6(4) was so widely worded that it was likely to result in grave injustice to a party in whose favour an award was made as S. 6(4) could be used to re-open the whole case. S. 6(4) conferred \"unguided and uncontrolled powers\" on the State Government. The power could be used arbitrarily to favour one party over the other; the power was capable of serious mischief.79The Court refused to accept the argument that the Government could seek necessary guidance from the object and content of the Act. Page 1006 In practice, however, courts show a good deal of tolerance and deference towards conferment of discretion, and it is only in an extreme situation that a statutory provision is declared invalid on the ground of conferring excessive administrative discretion. There are a number of cases in which conferment of broad discretion has been upheld on such grounds as: the statutory provision conferring power has sufficient guidelines, principles or policies to regulate the exercise of power; the power has been conferred on a high official who is not expected to misuse the same but is expected to exercise the power reasonably and rationally;80 there are procedural safeguards subject to which the power is to be exercised, such as, natural justice, recording of reasons for the decision, provision of appeal to a higher authority, etc.81 In Laxmi Divi82 the court has reiterated the principle that mere likelihood of abuse of discretionary power conferred under statute would not render the statutory provision unconstitutional. There is always a difference between a statute and the action taken under a statute i.e. the statute may be valid and Constitutional but the action taken under it is invalid. Thus while considering the validity of Section 47A of the Stamp Act the Court held that an arbitrary market value whether or not based on extraneous considerations can always be challenged in judicial review proceedings. As regards laying down of principles or guiding norms, it has been held, for instance, that it is not essential that the very section in the statute which confers the power should also lay down the rules of guidance, or the policy for the administrator to follow. If the same can be gathered from the preamble, or the long title of the statute and other provisions therein, the discretion would not be regarded as uncontrolled or unguided and the statute in question will not be invalid. At times, even vague policy statements to guide administrative discretion have been held by the courts as complying with Art. 14.83 An Orissa Act authorised the State Government to take over any estate free from all encumbrances. According to its preamble, the Act was passed in pursuance of the Directive Principles of State policy to secure economic justice to all.84 The Supreme Courtruled that there was a clear enunciation of the policy in the Act, and the discretion vested in the government was not absolute as it had to be exercised in the light of this policy. All estates in the State could not be taken over at once due to financial difficulties and, therefore, in the very nature of things it was necessary to give \"a certain amount of discretionary latitude to the State Government.\"85 The Kerala Education Bill gave a broad power of control to the government over private schools. As for example, government could recognise or not a newly established school, or could take over any school.",

    "content": "for example, government could recognise or not a newly established school, or could take over any school. The Supreme Court held that the general policy of the Bill was deducible from its preamble and the title, and the same was further reinforced by more definite statements of policy in different clauses. The government was to exercise its discretion to implement that policy. The power to take over schools could be exercised only after the Assembly passed a resolution authorising the government to do so. Thus the Bill was held valid under Art. 14.86 S. 10(1)of the Industrial Disputes Act empowers the government to refer an industrial dispute to a board for settlement, or a court of enquiry, or a tribunal for adjudication. It was challenged on the ground that it gave arbitrary power to the government to discriminate between parties similarly situated. Rejecting the contention, the Court observed that \"no two cases are alike in nature\", and the industrial disputes which arise in particular establishments require to be treated having regard to the situation prevailing in the same. The discretion is not uncontrolled as the criteria to exercise it are to be found within the Act itself.87 A Bihar Act enacted that every appointment, dismissal, removal of any teacher of a college made during November, 1961, and March, 1962, would be subject to such order as the Chancellor \"may, on the recommendation of the University Service Commission\", pass. The provision literally appears to give uncanalised powers to the Chancellor to do what he liked with respect to the said appointments. The Court however 'read down' the provision and held it valid. The Chancellor's authority was only to satisfy himself that the said appointments etc., were in accordance with the relevant University Act both as to the substantive and procedural aspects thereof. Then, before passing the order, he would receive recommendation from the University Commission which was bound to give a hearing to the person concerned. This was not uncanalised power.88 Page 1007 The power conferred by S. 10(3)(c) of the Passport Act on the Passport Authority to impound a passport \"in the interests of general public\" has been held to be not unguided or uncontrolled. The ground is not vague and indefinite. These words have a well-defined meaning as they have been taken from Art. 19(5).89 There are several procedural safeguards as well, e.g., recording of reasons for impounding the passport, supplying a copy thereof to the affected person, and an appeal from him to a higher authority and hearing of the affected person.90 Under S. Sections 105 of the Customs Act, if the Assistant Collector has reason to believe that some goods or documents are secreted, he can authorize any officer of customs to search for the same. The Assistant Collector is not obligated to give reasons for his belief, or to give the particulars of the goods or the documents. Nevertheless, theSupreme Court rejected the argument that arbitrary power was conferred on the Assistant Collector to make a search. The Court ruled that not only a policy has been laid down but effective checks on his exercise of the power to search have been imposed. The policy is that the search could be in regard to the goods liable to be confiscated, or for the documents relevant to a proceedings under the Act. Though the Assistant Collector need not give reasons for ordering a search, yet if the existence of his belief is questioned in any collateral proceeding, he has to produce relevant evidence to sustain his belief. Under S. 165(5) of the Cr.P.C., he has to send forthwith to the Collector of Customs a copy of any record made by him and the Collector can certainly give necessary directions if the Assistant Collector goes wrong. Further, underS. 136(2)of the Customs Act, the Assistant Collector can be prosecuted and punished if he requires any person or place being searched without having reason to believe that he has such goods on his person, or that goods are secreted in that place.91 A land tax law was challenged on the ground that it left the power to determine land value to the subjective satisfaction of the tax commissioner. The argument was rejected for the proceedings before him were quasi-judicial and an appeal lay against his decision to a tribunal. The commissioner had to reach the decision about land value objectively on materials produced before him.92 Under the Income-tax Act, a person may be assessed either at the place of business or residence. But the Commissioner of Income-tax may transfer a case from one I.T.O. to another, while the Board of Revenue could transfer it from one place to another. The validity of the provision was sustained in Pannalal Binjraj v. Union of India, 93 in the face of an attack that it vested the executive with arbitrary power to transfer the case of an assessee from one place to another while others similarly situated could continue to be assessed at the place of their business or residence. The Court held that the provision had been made for 'administrative convenience' and 'convenient and efficient assessment' of income-tax and, therefore, the power to transfer assessment was not naked but was guided and controlled by the purpose which is to be achieved by the Act itself. The case may be characterised as the high water-mark of judicial deference to administrative convenience, for 'administrative convenience' by itself could hardly be regarded as a definite policy to control administrative discretion.94 A law authorised the competent authority to declare an area as a slum area, to declare house unfit for human habitation, and declare a slum area as a clearance area. These provisions were challenged under Art. 14 on the ground that they did not provide for a reasonable opportunity to the affected parties to be heard.",

    "content": "provisions were challenged under Art. 14 on the ground that they did not provide for a reasonable opportunity to the affected parties to be heard. The considerations which the authority had to keep in view in deciding whether an area was a slum area, or whether a house was unfit for habitation were laid down. Considering the constitutionality of the impugned provisions, the Supreme Court stated in State of Mysore v. Bhat, 95 that there were two possible approaches to this question. One, to hold the provisions unconstitutional because they did not provide a reasonable opportunity for the affected parties to be heard. Two, if in the absence of anything to the contrary, the authority concerned was bound to follow the principles of natural justice, the law was not unconstitutional but the orders issued by the authority would be bad if issued without following natural justice. The Court adopted the second alternative in the instant case. There was nothing in the Act militating against the opportunity to be heard. Further, the nature of the statutory duty was such that it implied an obligation on Page 1008 the authority to hear before deciding. The statutory provisions were therefore held valid, but the orders made under them were declared invalid as these had been issued without giving hearing to the affected persons. The Court could come to this conclusion because of the fact that the right of hearing is now given a wide operation in administrative proceedings.1 Broad discretion conferred on a high official may be held valid on the ground that he is expected to act with responsibility and not to misuse his power. As the Supreme Court observed in Organo Chemicals:2 \"When power is conferred on high and responsible officers they are expected to act with caution and impartiality while discharging their duties ... The vesting of discretionary power in the State or public authorities or an officer of high standing is treated as a guarantee that the power will be used fairly and with a sense of responsibility.\" To illustrate this principle, broad discretion conferred on the Comptroller and Auditor-General in respect of fixation of seniority among the staff was upheld on the ground that he was a high ranking constitutional authority who would act according to the needs of his department and without arbitrariness.3 In many cases, large discretionary power conferred on the government without any built-in safeguards or guidelines, have been held valid on the ground that the government can be expected to exercise its powers with extreme caution and care.4 In Union of India v. Annam Ramalingam, 5 the Supreme Courtupheld the validity of S. Sections 28 of the Gold Control Act, 1968, against attack on the ground, that it provided no criteria or guidelines for the exercise of his power by the Administrator.S. 28 barred a licensed dealer, unless authorised by the Administrator, to carry on business as a money lender or banker on the security of ornaments or any other article. Although, there was no express rule prescribing the conditions or circumstances for grant of power had been made, that was held not to be decisive of the matter. S. 28 being a part and parcel of the entire scheme of gold control as envisaged by the Act \"the object of the enactment and the scheme affords sufficient guidance to the Administrator in the matter of exercising his discretion under that section\". S. 28 was designed to prevent circumvention of other provisions of the Act. Against the Administrator's order a revision lay to the Central Government \"which implies that he will have to make judicious use of his power or discretion and any improper exercise is liable to be corrected by a higher authority\". On the whole, while the basic principle stands, viz., uncontrolled discretion ought not to be conferred on the administration, the general judicial tendency is to apply this principle in a very flexible manner. The courts tend to uphold the law rather than declare it invalid on this ground which is done only in rare cases.6 The proposition that high officials can be entrusted with large powers is untenable. Every person, high or low, is susceptible to misusing power in the absence of proper controls. The status of an officer is no guarantee that he will not misuse his powers.7 In fact, the Supreme Court has itself warned that \"wide discretion is fraught with tyrannical potential even in high personages, absent legal norms and institutional checks.\"8 A powerful reiteration of the principle that uncontrolled and unguided discretionary power is incompatible with Art. 14 comes from the Supreme Court in Suman Gupta v. State of Jammu & Kashmir .9 The Medical Council of India in a report on undergraduate medical education, recommended that with a view to encouraging national integration, 10 per cent of the seats in every medical college, other than those where admissions were planned on an All India basis, should be reserved on a reciprocal basis for students from other States. This recommendation was later accepted at a joint conference of the Central Council of Health and the Central Family Welfare Council with the modification that such reservation should be 5%. Thereafter, the States of Andhra Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu agreed among themselves to nominate candidates reserved in the medical colleges of the other participating States. The instant case raised the question of the validity of the nominations made by the Governments of Andhra Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir reciprocally in the medical colleges of each other on the ground that the nominations were made by the State Governments in their absolute and arbitrary discretion. The Supreme Court declared this procedure of nominating candidates by the governments \"in their absolute and unfettered choice\" to seats for the MBBS course in medical colleges outside their respective States on a reciprocal Page 1009 basis as unconstitutional under Art. 14.",

    "content": "Supreme Court declared this procedure of nominating candidates by the governments \"in their absolute and unfettered choice\" to seats for the MBBS course in medical colleges outside their respective States on a reciprocal Page 1009 basis as unconstitutional under Art. 14. While commending the goal of national integration as highly commendable and laudable, the Court has not accepted the thesis that the selection of candidates for that purpose must remain in the unlimited discretion and the uncontrolled choice of the State Government. \"The exercise of all administrative power vested in public authority must be structured within a system of controls informed by both relevance and reason, relevance in relation to the object which it seeks to serve, and reason in regard to the manner in which it attempts to do so.\" Art. 14 is violated by powers and procedures which in themselves result in unfairness and arbitrariness. The Court has emphasized: \"...there is a well-recognised distinction between an administrative power to be exercised within defined limits in the reasonable discretion of designated authority and the vesting of an absolute and uncontrolled power in such authority. One is power controlled by law countenanced by the Constitution, the other falls outside the Constitution altogether.\" Thus, if the State Government desires to advance the objective of national integration it must adopt procedures \"which are reasonable and are related to the objective\". It is incumbent on the government to adopt a criterion or restrict its power by reference to norms which, while designed to achieve its object, nevertheless, confine the flow of that power within constitutional limits. The Court rejected an argument of the State Governments that as the governments finance medical education within their respective States, they are entitled to exercise absolute discretion in the nomination of the candidates to seats in medical colleges outside the States concerned, \"specially when the nomination is part of a reciprocal arrangement between the different States.\" The Court directed the Medical Council of India \"to formulate a proper constitutional basis for determining the selection of candidates for nomination to seats in medical colleges outside the State in the light of the observations contained in this judgment.\" Until such a policy is formulated and concrete criteria are embodied in the selection procedure, the nominations are to be made by selecting candidates strictly on merit, the candidates nominated being those in order of merit, immediately below the candidates selected for admission to the medical college of the home State. S. Sections 3 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, empowers the State Government to appoint as many special Judges as may be necessary \"for such case or group of cases\" as may be specified in the notification. The validity of this provision was challenged under Art. 14 on the ground that it confers unfettered, unguided and absolute discretion on the Government and is thus capable of leading to abuse of power by the Government. The Supreme Court has however upheld the validity of this provision in J. Jayalalitha v. Union of India .10 The Court has agreed with the proposition that conferment of discretionary power on the executive which in the absence of any policy or guidelines permits it to pick and choose is unconstitutional.11But, in the instant case, the Court has ruled that S. 3(1) does not confer unfettered or unguided power because the object of the Act and S. 3 indicate when, and under what circumstances, the power conferred by S. 3 has to be exercised. The policy can be gathered from the preamble, the provisions of the enactment and other surrounding circumstances.12 One of the objects of the Act is to provide speedy trial far cases of corruption. This is the policy of the Act and, therefore, while exercising the power under S. 3, the Government shall have to be guided by the said policy. The Legislature could not have anticipated as to how many special Judges would be needed in an area. Therefore, the Legislature could not have laid down any fixed rule or guideline. It had to leave this matter to the discretion of the State Government as it would be in a better position to know the requirement. This is why discretion has been conferred on the State Government to appoint as many special Judges as may be necessary. Absolute discretion to give or not to give gratuity has been rejected as unenforceable.13 (ii) ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRIMINATION Page 1010 Here we see the application of the second proposition mentioned above.14 The first proposition discussed above envisages that where a statute is discriminatory either because it does not make a reasonable classification, or confers unregulated discretion on the executive, the statute itself is void under Art. 14. The second proposition being discussed now, however, envisages the situation where the statute itself does not suffer from any such vice, but the administrative authority may implement it in a discriminatory manner, or may not follow the policy or principle laid down in the Act to regulate its discretion. In such a case, the charge of violation of equal protection may be laid against the Administration and its action quashed under Art. 14. The classic case on the point is Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 15 an American case. By an ordinance, the City of San Francisco made it unlawful to carry on a laundry, without the consent of the board of supervisors, except in a brick or stone building. In administering, the ordinance, 200 Chinese launderers were denied permission, even though they complied with every requisite, while 80 non-Chinese under similar circumstances had been permitted. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the ordinance has been administered with \"a mind so unequal and oppressive as to amount to a practical denial by the State\" of equal protection of laws.",

    "content": "U.S. Supreme Court held that the ordinance has been administered with \"a mind so unequal and oppressive as to amount to a practical denial by the State\" of equal protection of laws. Though the law itself may be fair on its face, yet, if it is administered by public authority \"with an evil eye and an unequal hand\", so as practically to make unjust and illegal discriminations between persons in similar circumstances, the denial of equal justice is still within the prohibition of Art. 14. This Article secures all persons in India \"not only against arbitrary laws but also against arbitrary application of laws.\" It ensures non-discrimination in state action both in the legislative and the administrative spheres. The Cotton Control Order, 1950, banned all contracts and options in cotton except those permitted by the Textile Commissioner. The Commissioner permitted hedging contracts by members of the East-India Cotton Association. On being challenged by the M.B. Cotton Association which had been denied permission to enter into hedging contracts, the Supreme Court denied that there was discrimination because while East-India was an old and well-organised body dealing in hedging contracts, the M.B. Association was a new body and so the two Associations were not on an equal footing.16 In Lumsden Club v. State of Punjab, 17 the Excise Commissioner banned the sale of liquor at the Lumsden Club but not at other clubs which were in similar position. The order was quashed as there was unjust discrimination. There could be a situation where discretion though conferred subject to a standard or policy, may be exercised in disregard of the policy. If so, it can be challenged under Art. 14. A Tamil Trust made an application to the Government of Andhra Pradesh seeking permission to establish an engineering college for the benefit of the Tamil minority in the State of Andhra Pradesh. The Government refused permission to the Trust but at the same time it granted permission to two other societies to establish private engineering colleges. In Vellore Educational Trust v. State of Andhra Pradesh, 18 the Court quashed the Government's refusal of permission to the Tamil Trust as \"not at all tenable\" and quashed it. The Court also directed the Government to reconsider the matter and dispose it of according to law. This is an instance of discriminatory governmental action. Although the principle is well-established that discriminatory administrative action can be challenged under Art. 14, yet, in practice, challenges to administrative action succeed only rarely, for the judicial attitude generally is to sustain administrative action against attacks of discrimination. The courts start with a presumption that the administration has not acted in a discriminatory manner; they would not easily assume abuse of power when discretion is vested in high officials. Further, the onus to prove that there has been an abuse of power is on the complainant. If, however, in a particular case, the complainant points out the circumstances which prima facie make out the exercise of power discriminatory qua him, then the authority concerned would be obligated to explain the circumstances under which the order was made. The court would then scrutinise the circumstances \"with regard to the object sought to be achieved by the enactment and come to its own conclusion with respect to the bona fides of the order\". The administration would have a good defence if it can prove bona fides.19 Selective application of law on an objective basis is not objectionable. The leading case in the area is Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Justice Tendolkar .20A commission of inquiry was appointed into Dalmia concerns by a notification under S. 3 of the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952. S. 3 as well as the notification were Page 1011 challenged as discriminatory. S. 3 was held valid as the discretion conferred thereunder was not unguided because it was to be exercised subject to the policy and conditions laid down in the Act, viz., a commission could be appointed to inquire into a definite matter of public importance. The notification was also sustained against the charge that it arbitrarily singled out the petitioner and his companies for hostile and discriminatory treatment and subjected them to a harassing and oppressive inquiry. The Court held that Parliament having left the selective application of the Inquiry Act to the discretion of the government, the latter must act on the information available to it and the opinion it formed thereon. It is to be presumed, until the contrary is proved, that the government would act honestly, properly and in conformity with the policy and the principles laid down by Parliament. The Court further held that the quality and characteristics said to exist in the petitioner's companies were so unique as to constitute a good or valid basis on which the petitioner and his companies could be regarded as a class by themselves. The facts as disclosed afforded sufficient support to the presumption of constitutionality of the notification. The petitioners failed to discharge the onus on them to prove that other persons or companies similarly situated have been left out and that they had been singled out for discriminatory and hostile treatment. In State of Jammu & Kashmir v. Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad, 21 appointment of a Commission of Inquiry to enquire into acquisition of wealth by the former Prime Minister of the State by misuse of his official position was challenged as discriminatory as it was directed only against the Prime Minister and not the rest of his cabinet colleagues. The Court rejected the argument saying that it would be strange if the inquiry were also directed against all the other Ministers, for it could not be asserted that all Ministers had acquired wealth by misuse of their official position. The Prime Minister was a class by himself, and it could not be argued that by picking the former Prime Minister out of the entire cabinet for the enquiry, he had been discriminated.",

The Prime Minister was a class by himself, and it could not be argued that by picking the former Prime Minister out of the entire cabinet for the enquiry, he had been discriminated. At times, a statute may grant power to government to exempt any person or object from the operation of the Act. Such a power would be valid if not uncontrolled, and the statute in question contains a policy for its exercise.22But if the power of exemption granted by the statute to the government is uncanalised, unlimited or arbitrary, and the Act does not lay down any principle or policy for the guidance of exercise of discretion, or if the exemption granted is not according to the policy of the statute, the same can be quashed. Even when the grant of power of exemption is held valid, a question may still be raised that the actual exercise of power is arbitrary or illegal. Under the Madras Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act, 1949, the government could exempt any building or class of buildings from the provisions of the Act. A government order exempting a specific building was held to be discriminatory as the reasons which led the government to pass the order were not such as could be countenanced by the policy or purpose of the Act.23 Under s. 113 of the T.N. Town and Country Planning Act, 1971, government could grant exemption to \"any land or building or class of lands or buildings\" from \"all or any of the provisions of this Act\" \"subject to such conditions as they deem fit.\" This provision was held valid as the Supreme Courtfound that the preamble to the Act and many of the provisions of the Act \"clearly indicate its policy\". \"Each of them contributes for subserving the policy of the Act, and clearly declares the purpose of the Act.\" Therefore, s. 113 could not be held to be 'unbridled'. But a number of exemption orders issued under this provision were invalidated by the Supreme Courton the ground that these orders revealed non-application of mind and had been passed mechanically and arbitrarily and not in furtherance of the policy of the Act. The State of Andhra Pradesh levied a purchase tax on purchase of sugarcane by sugar mills. The government had power to exempt from payment of tax any new factory. The government adopted the policy to grant exemption only to co-operative sugar factories and no other new factory. While 3 Judges of the Supreme Court held the exercise of discretion proper, two Judges held it invalid. According to the minority Judges, the policy of the Act was to provide incentive to the establishment of new sugar factories. Therefore, the policy regarding exemption must have some rational relation to the object. From this point of view, all new factories stand on the same footing, and there can be no justification for giving a favoured treatment to co-operative societies. Preferring co-operative societies to other new sugar factories \"is wholly unrelated to Page 1012 the object of the exempting provision\". The view of the minority in the above case appears to be more rational for the government policy in effect meant promotion of co-operative societies and not sugar industry generally, and this was not what the Act envisaged. Each case of exemption should have been considered on merits. Whether a factory was co-operative or not was an irrelevant consideration for this purpose.24 At times, a statute may empower the government to extend any or all of its provisions to other persons, places or activities. Here again the same question arises: Is the power unguided? Has some policy been laid down for the purpose? If extended to a person or activity, whether this has been done according to the policy?25 The Government of India raised the age of compulsory retirement from 55 to 58 years subject to some conditions. The respondent was not given the benefit of this decision. The Court quashed the order holding it to be a violation of Art. 14.26 The Assam Foodgrains (Licensing & Control) Order, 1961, enumerated five considerations to which the licensing authority was to keep regard in granting or refusing a licence. One of these considerations was that a co-operative society was to be preferred to anyone else in certain circumstances in granting a licence. But when the government directed the licensing authority to grant licences only to a specified co-operative society, in order to create a monopoly in its favour, and the licensing officer acted accordingly, then a discrimination arose against others and this was bad under Art. 14. Under the order, it was open to the licensing authority to give preference to co-operative societies in the matter of granting a licence if in a particular locality it was of the view that that would fulfil the objectives of the statutory provision in question. But to refuse licence to anyone else only to create a monopoly in favour of one co-operative society amounted to discrimination in the administration of the law.27 When a higher qualification is prescribed having regard to the current social conditions and only graduates and post-graduates in veterinary science are coming out in large number and many degree holders are unemployed and, moreover, new diseases are discovered and new techniques are in use, the prescription of higher qualification is in consonance with the worldwide trend and in the interest of general public. Such qualification provisions are protected under the second part of Art. 19(6). Restrictions on rights of the diploma and certificate holders to continue to hold office of veterinary physician or surgeon or to practice veterinary medicine is reasonable within the meaning of Art. 19(6) and hence not violative of Art. 19(1)(g).",

    "content": "qualification provisions are protected under the second part of Art. 19(6). Restrictions on rights of the diploma and certificate holders to continue to hold office of veterinary physician or surgeon or to practice veterinary medicine is reasonable within the meaning of Art. 19(6) and hence not violative of Art. 19(1)(g). Hardship to a section of veterinary professionals or holders of office, because of introduction of the higher qualification could not render the new provisions for higher qualification unconstitutional. Furthermore the qualifications prescribed were to operate prospectively and merely because it affected the rights of diploma and certificate holders to continue in their profession, it could not be said to have retrospective operation. The confusion which some time arises regarding conferring retrospectivity to a statute was explained to some extent by the Supreme Court in Udai Singh Dagar.28 In that case the qualifications for veterinary practitioners was altered to the effect that their qualification should be a degree or a post-graduate degree instead of existing diplomas. The contention that it operated retrospectively since the diploma holders who are already in service could no longer hold their office was rejected by the Court on the reasoning that a person would have a right to enter into a profession and continue therewith provided he holds the requisite qualification as and when a qualification is laid down by a law within the meaning of Art. 19(1)(g) of the Constitution when the same comes into effect. In other words, it would operate prospectively and, thus those who did not fulfill the qualification from the specified date would not continue to practice from that date. VIVA VOCE For selecting candidates for admission to government medical or engineering colleges, or for appointment to government services, a test usually applied is that of viva voce, i.e., interviewing candidates and grading them on that basis. Questions have been raised whether or not oral interview is compatible with Art. 14. Two considerations arise in connection with the viva voce test. On the one hand, such a test is helpful in assessing the personality of the candidate. As the Supreme Court has itself accepted in Ashok Kumar Yadav Page 1013 v. State of Haryana, 29 the viva voce test \"performs a very useful function in assessing personal characteristics and traits\" of the candidates. On the other hand, it has been argued that an oral interview is subjective and based on first impressions and could thus lead to arbitrariness. A viva voce test can be manipulated. Too much reliance on this test may lead to a sabotage of the purity of the proceedings. Taking into account these considerations, the Supreme Court has ruled that while viva voce test forms an important factor in the selection process but not too great reliance need be placed on it.30 While holding that oral interview could not be regarded as an irrelevant or irrational test for purposes of admission to colleges or for public employment, the Supreme Court has also laid down some safeguards to reduce chances of arbitrariness as the Supreme Court is apprehensive that if too high marks are allotted for the viva voce test, it may lead to misuse of power by the concerned authorities. In case of selection for services, a somewhat higher percentage of marks is permissible for viva voce than in case of admission to a course for, in the latter case, the personality traits of the students are not fully developed and are still in the formative stage and, therefore, in case of students, greater importance is to be accorded to the written test than to the viva voce to which importance attached ought to be minimal. In case of students, viva voce should not be relied upon as an exclusive test but should be resorted to only as an additional or supplementary test; it must be conducted by persons of high integrity, calibre and qualification; very high marks (such as 33 per cent of the total marks) should not be allocated to the interview test. For admission to colleges, not more than 15 per cent of the total marks should be fixed for interview.31 However, for appointment to public services (such as munsiffs), a higher relative value may be given (say 25 per cent) to the viva voce test, the reason being that candidates have mature personality.32 The Court pointed out that the written test assesses the man's intellect and the interview test the man himself and \"the twain shall meet\" for a proper selection. In case of services where selection is made out of mature persons, a higher weightage may be given to the viva voce test. If, however, selection is to be made out of younger persons whose personalities are still in the process of development, a lower weightage is to be given to viva voce. \"It must vary from service to service according to the requirement....\" There have been several cases in which the validity of selections made on the basis of viva voce test have been challenged. In Chitralekha v. State of Mysore, 33 a system of selection of candidates for admission to the State medical colleges by viva voce examination was challenged on the ground that it enabled the interviewers to act arbitrarily and manipulate the results. The Supreme Court rejected the contention holding that not only had the government laid down a clear policy and prescribed defined criteria in the matter of giving marks at the interview, but it had also appointed competent men to make the selection on the basis. On the other hand, in Periakaruppan,34 the interviews were found to be vitiated. For admission to the State medical colleges, certain marks had been allotted to the viva voce test and the interviewers were required to take five prescribed criteria into consideration for the purpose.",

    "content": "the other hand, in Periakaruppan,34 the interviews were found to be vitiated. For admission to the State medical colleges, certain marks had been allotted to the viva voce test and the interviewers were required to take five prescribed criteria into consideration for the purpose. The interviews were quashed because the total interview marks had not been divided into separate prescribed heads and marks had been given to the candidates in a lump and not on itemised basis and also while irrelevant matters had been taken into consideration certain relevant matters had been ignored. The most significant pronouncement in this area is Ajay Hasia.35 Here a large number of candidates were given admission to the regional engineering college because of high marks obtained at the interview although they had secured low marks at the written qualifying examination. According to the Supreme Court, this did give rise to the suspicion that marks at the interview had been manipulated to favour candidates but did not prove mala fides. The Court did not quash the admissions made by the college because it agreed to take in 50 best students next year in addition to the normal in-take. The Court laid down the following guidelines so that the interview system might not be vitiated under Art. 14: \"If the marks allocated for the oral interview do not exceed 15% of the total marks and the candidates are properly interviewed and relevant questions are asked with a view to assessing their suitability with reference to the factors required to be taken into consideration, the oral interview test would satisfy the criterion of reasonableness and non-arbitrariness.\" Page 1014 The Court further suggested that the interviews be tape-recorded so that there is evidence to judge whether interviews were conducted in an arbitrary manner or not. In case of viva voce test for services, even between one service and another, depending upon the significance and relevance of the personality factor, maximum marks for interview may vary, as for example, higher marks for viva voce test may be prescribed for the Provincial Civil Service than in case of any other service. The Supreme Court expressed the view that in Civil Service (Executive), not more than 12.2% of the total marks be allotted to the viva voce test. Commenting upon the prescription of 33.3% marks for recruitment to administrative services of the State, the Court said that with this enormously large spread of marks for viva voce, this test \"tended to become a determining factor in the selection process\", and this \"opens the door wide for arbitrariness, and in order to diminish, if not eliminate the risk of arbitrariness, this percentage needs to be changed.\" In Ashok Yadav v. State of Haryana, 36 the Court ruled that the allocation of 33% marks for the Provincial Civil Service was excessive and would suffer from the vice of arbitrariness and, therefore, quashed it. But, in later cases, the Court has changed its opinion and has accepted allocation of high percentage of marks for viva voce test for recruitment to Senior State Administrative Services. In Mehmood Alam Tariq v. State of Rajasthan, 37 the Court has accepted a percentage of 33 for the purpose. Distinguishing the situation in the instant case from that which was considered in Ajay Hasia, the Court has pointed out that the officers to be selected for higher services would, in course of time, be required \"to man increasingly responsible positions in the core services,\" and, therefore, these men should be endowed with personality traits conducive to the levels of performance in such services. Ajay Hasia refers to admission of students to educational institutions and the personality of these students \"is yet to develop and it is too early to identify the personal qualities.\" The Court observed: \"There is nothing unreasonable or arbitrary in the stipulation that officers to be selected for higher services and who are with the passage of time, expected to man increasingly responsible positions in the core services...should be men endowed with personality traits conducive to the level of performance expected in such services... Academic excellence is one thing. Ability to deal with public with tact and imagination is another. Both are necessary for an officer. The dose that is demanded may vary according to the nature of the service.\" A similar view has been propounded in State of Uttar Pradesh v. Rafiquddin, 38 where prescription of 35% marks for selection for judicial branch was upheld. In other services, however, the Court still insists on a low percentage of marks for viva voce. Thus, in Vikram Singh,39 allocation of 28.5% marks for interview for selection to the posts of excise inspectors was held to be too high and was thus quashed. The Court has ruled that for selection to the posts of assistant engineers in the State Electricity Board, a maximum of 15% marks may be allotted for interview and group discussion--10% for interview and 5% for group discussion.40 Allocation of 33% marks for interview for selection for the posts of Assistant Engineers (Civil) and (Mechanical) for Public Works Dept. was held to be too high and not in accordance with the dictum in Ashok Yadav.41 The Supreme Court has pointed out in Indian Airlines Corporation v. Capt. K.C. Shukla, 42 that a distinction appears to have been made in interviews held for competitive examination or admission in educational institutions and selection for higher posts. In the former case, efforts are made to limit the scope of arbitrariness by lowering down the proportion of marks at the viva voce but the same standard cannot be applied for selection for higher posts. This becomes clear from the ruling in Lila Dhar.43 It is thus clear that no hard and fast rule can be laid down because much would depend on the level of the post and the nature of performance expected from the incumbent.",

Accordingly, in Shukla, the basis of evaluation depending on 50% on assessment of confidential reports and 50% on interviews for purposes of promotion was upheld by the Court. In Union of India v. N. Chandrasekharan, 44 for the promotional post of assistant purchase officer from the post of purchase assistant--B, the promotion was based on a written test, interview and assessment of the Page 1015 confidential reports. The weightage given to each component was 50, 30, 20 marks. It was also prescribed that to qualify for promotion, a candidate should secure a minimum of 50% prescribed for each head and also 60% in the aggregate. This scheme of assessment was upheld by the Supreme Court. (iii) ARBITRARY STATE ACTION Art. 14 out-laws arbitrary administrative action. When there is arbitrariness in state action, Art. 14 springs into action and the courts strike down such action. Arbitrary state action infringes Art. 14.45 A very fascinating aspect of Art. 14 which the courts in India have developed over time is that Art. 14 embodies \"a guarantee against arbitrariness\" on the part of the Administration. As the Supreme Court has observed in Royappa:46 \"from a positivistic point of view, equality is antithetic to arbitrariness.\" Any action that is arbitrary must necessarily involve the negation of equality. Abuse of power is hit by Art. 14. The authority endowed with a power must free itself from political interference.47 The new orientation being given to Art. 14 by the courts has been explained by Bhagwati, J., in Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab .48 Rule of law which permeates the entire fabric of the Indian Constitution excludes arbitrariness. \"Wherever we find arbitrariness or unreasonableness there is denial of rule of law.\" Art. 14 enacts primarily a guarantee against arbitrariness and inhibits state action, whether legislative or executive, which suffers from the view of arbitrariness. \"Every state action must be non-arbitrary and reasonable. Otherwise, the Court would strike it down as invalid.\" To challenge an arbitrary action under Art. 14, the petitioner does not have to show that there is someone else similarly situated as he himself, or that he has been dissimilarly treated. On this point, the Supreme Court has observed in Kalra:49 \" Article 14 strikes at arbitrariness in executive/administrative action because any action that is arbitrary must necessarily involve the negation of equality. One need not confine the denial of equality to a comparative evaluation between two persons to arrive at a conclusion of discriminatory treatment. An action per se arbitrary itself denies equality of protection by law.\" This new dimension of Art. 14 transcends the classificatory principle. Art. 14 is no longer to be equated with the principle of classification. It is primarily a guarantee against arbitrariness in state action and the doctrine of classification has been evolved only as a subsidiary rule for testing whether a particular state action is arbitrary or not. If a law is arbitrary or irrational it would fall foul of Art. 14. As an example thereof, it has been held that any penalty disproportionate to the gravity of the misconduct would be violative of Art. 14.50 Every action of the state must be informed by reasons and guided by public interest. Actions uninformed by reason may be questioned as arbitrary. Whenever there is arbitrariness in state action, Art. 14 springs to life and judicial review strikes such an action down.51 Arbitrariness is the antithesis of Art. 14.52 Equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies. Art. 14 strikes at arbitrariness in state action and ensures fairness and equality of treatment.53 In a number of cases, government action has been quashed on the ground of its being arbitrary or discriminatory. Art. 14 strikes not only at discrimination but also at arbitrariness in general. The wage board for working journalists divided the newspapers and news agencies into seven classes on the basis of gross revenues. According to this test, the P.T.I. should have been placed in the third category but the wage board placed it in the second--a higher category, thus placing on the P.T.I. more onerous obligations. This was held to be arbitrary which \"singles out the P.T.I. for discrimination.\"54 Spot admissions on the last day for vacant seats without notice in State owned institutions for higher professional education was held bad as it denied equality of opportunity and the test of merit. \"The State even in the exercise of its administrative power cannot act arbitrarily. Being the State it is obliged to act in a fair, reasonable and equitable manner.\"55 The State Government exempted only a specified number of prints of the Gandhi film (20) from payment of entertainment tax. Viewers of other prints of the film had to pay the tax. The Court held that exempting only a Page 1016 few prints, and not all prints of the film, was discriminatory and arbitrary.56 When the circumstances provided under specific clauses of the Scheme and the agreement, as to events on which cash subsidy could be recovered as arrears of land revenue were not attracted on the facts, recovery of the subsidy by the State in violation of those clauses was illegal and arbitrary.57 The State Government fixed higher quantity of levy sugar for higher income group. The High Court held that this was not based on any rational basis as it allowed better placed persons to get more sugar at the cheapest rate.58 In a number of other cases, arbitrary or discriminatory exercise of power by the administration has been quashed by the courts.59 When an authority has power to relax a directory rule, its relaxation in particular cases has to be governed by objective considerations. No public authority can pick and choose persons for receiving the benefit of relaxation of the rules.",

    "content": "public authority can pick and choose persons for receiving the benefit of relaxation of the rules. Relaxation must be governed by defined guidelines.60 When the only reason for the en masse cancellation was that a \"controversy\" had been raised, there was clear non application of mind to any particular case or cases and more so when infact none of the cases were examined.61 The Government of Uttar Pradesh issued an order terminating at one stroke the appointment of all the governmental advocates throughout the entire State. In Shrilekha Vidyarthi v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 62 the Supreme Court quashed the order characterising it as arbitrary: \"Arbitrariness is writ large in the impugned circular.\" The Court stated the applicable principle as follows: \"It is now well-settled that every state action, in order to survive, must not be susceptible to the vice of arbitrariness which is the crux of Art. 14 of the Constitution and basic to the rule of law, the system which governs us, arbitrariness being the negation of the rule of law.\" Another notable principle developed by the Supreme Court out of Art. 14 is that every action of the government, or any of its instrumentalities, must be informed by reason. Any state action which is not informed by reason cannot be protected as it would be easy for the citizens to question such an action as being arbitrary. \"Non-arbitrariness, being a necessary concomitant of the rule of law, it is imperative that all actions of every public functionary in whatever sphere must be guided by reason and not humour, whim, caprice or personal predilections of the persons entrusted with the task on behalf of the State and exercise of all powers must be for public good instead of being an abuse of power.\"63 The decision not to fill up the vacancies has to be taken bona fide and must pass the test of reasonableness so as not to fail on the touchstone of Art. 14.64 The government and other public authorities must act reasonably and fairly and that each action of such authorities must pass the test of reasonableness.65 But a case of arbitrariness is not made out where two views are possible and the view taken by the government cannot be challenged on the ground that the other view is a better one.66 Mere fact that some hardship or injustice is caused to someone is no ground to strike down the rule altogether if otherwise the rule appears to be just, fair and reasonable and not unconstitutional.67 (a) RIGHT OF HEARING In some cases, the Courts have insisted, with a view to control arbitrary action on the part of the administration, that the person adversely affected by administrative action be given the right of being heard before the Administration passes an order against him. It is believed that such a procedural safeguard may minimise the chance of the Administration passing an arbitrary order. Thus, the Supreme Court has extracted from Art. 14 the principle that natural justice is an integral part of administrative process. Art. 14 guarantees a right of hearing to the person adversely affected by an administrative order.68 As the Page 1017 Supreme Court has observed in the case noted below,69 \"The audi alteram partem rule, in essence, enforces the equality clause in Art. 14 and it is applicable not only to quasi- judicial bodies but also to administrative orders adversely affecting the party in question unless the rule has been excluded by the Act in question.\"70Maneka Gandhi71 is an authority for the proposition that the principles of natural justice are an integral part of the guarantee of equality assured by Art. 14. An order depriving a person of his civil right passed without affording him an opportunity of being heard suffers from the vice of violation of natural justice and is thus an arbitrary order.72 A few cases may be taken note of here to illustrate this proposition. The Maharashtra Legislature enacted an Act to provide for summary eviction of persons unauthorisedly occupying vacant lands in urban areas. The Act gave power to an authorised authority to order vacation of any land by its occupiers. The Supreme Courtheld the Act to be invalid in State of Maharashtra v. Kamal, 73 under Art. 14 on the ground that it laid down no guidelines to control the exercise of discretion by the concerned authority. The Act prescribed no procedure for the concerned authority to follow before declaring any land as \"Vacant land\" for the purposes of the Act. The Supreme Court emphasized that the Act conferred 'uncontrolled and arbitrary\" power on the authority and, therefore, in the matters covered by the Act, a hearing procedure was of the essence of the matter. A government company made a service rule authorising it to terminate the service of a permanent employee by merely giving him a three months' notice or salary. The rule was declared to be invalid as being violative of Art. 14 on the ground that it was unconscionable.74 The rule in question constituted a part of the employment contract between the corporation and its employees. The Court ruled that it would not enforce, and would strike down, an unfair and unreasonable clause in a contract entered into between parties who were not equal in bargaining power. This was in conformity with the mandate of the \"great equality clause in Art. 14.\" The Court emphasized that the judicial concept of Art. 14 has progressed \"from a prohibition against discriminatory class legislation to an invalidating factor for any discriminatory or arbitrary state action.\" The Court also emphasized that the rule was \"both arbitrary and unreasonable\" and \"as it also wholly ignored and set aside the audi alteram partem rule\" violated Art. 14. The Court emphasized that \"the principle of natural justice has now come to be recognised as being a part of the constitutional guarantee contained in Art.",

    "content": "The Court emphasized that \"the principle of natural justice has now come to be recognised as being a part of the constitutional guarantee contained in Art. 14.\" The rule in question was \"both arbitrary and unreasonable,\" and it also wholly ignored and set aside the audi alteram partem rule and, thus, it violated Art. 14. The above proposition has been reiterated by the Supreme Court in D.T.C. v. D.T.C. Mazdoor Union.75 The Court again held, rejecting a clause authorising termination of service at a month's notice, that the freedom of contract must be founded on equality of bargaining power between contracting parties. The freedom of contract must be founded on the equality of bargaining power. There can be myriad situations which result in unfair and unreasonable bargain between parties possessing wholly disproportionate and unequal bargaining power. The Cantonment Board, Dinapur, granted permission to the respondent to make additions to their buildings situated in the cantonment. Under a provision in the Cantonments Act, 1924, the officer commanding-in-chief had power to suspend a Board's resolution. In the instant case,76 the OCIC cancelled the Board's resolution after giving it a hearing but not to the respondent to whom the permission had been given. The Supreme Court ruled that OCIC ought to have given a hearing to the respondent as well before cancelling the permission given by the Board. The Court observed: \"Audi alteram partem is a part of Art. 14 of the Constitution.\" The real affected party in the fact situation was the party being ultimately affected by cancellation of the Board's resolution. Because of Art. 14, \"no order shall be passed at the back of a person, prejudicial in nature to him, when it entails civil consequences.\" Merely because in the scheme of merger of two government companies the employees of one of them would suffer in terms of seniority or chances of promotion, the whole scheme could not be treated as discriminatory or arbitrary.77 Page 1018 (b) JUDICIAL DISCRETION Discretion vested in a judicial officer exercisable on the facts and circumstances of each particular case may not amount to a denial of equal protection unless \"there is shown to be present in it an element of intentional and purposeful discrimination.\" The discretion of judicial officers is not arbitrary as the law provides for revision by superior courts of orders passed by subordinate courts.78 The discretion given to the judge to sentence an accused convicted of murder either to death or to imprisonment for life is not invalid under Art. 14. The judge has to balance all the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the case and record his reasons in writing for awarding lesser punishment.79 Similarly, discretion available to the judge in other criminal cases in the sentencing policy and the judicial fluctuations in punishment do not violate Art. 14.80 The same principle has been extended to discretion given to quasi-judicial authorities, e.g., rent controller, disciplinary authority etc.81 (iv) GRANT OF BENEFITS BY THE STATE A welfare state has wide power to regulate and dispense leases, licenses, contracts, etc. The modern state is a source of great wealth and, therefore, questions often arise whether it is bound by any norm in dispensing its largess. In India, it is now well established that in dispensing its largess, the state is expected not to act as a private individual but should act in conformity with certain healthy standards and norms.82 The principle of non-discrimination contained in Art. 14 has been applied by the Supreme Court in an area of great contemporary importance, viz., conferment of benefits and award of contracts by the government. Art. 14 has been applied to the grant of largess or benefit by the state. Even while conferring a benefit or largess, or giving a contract, the government is subject to Art. 14. This means that the Administration cannot act in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner even in the area of grant of largess or conferring benefit by it on individuals. The government is not as free as a private person to pick and choose the recipients of its largess. Whatever its activity, a government is always a government and, as such, is subject to the restraints, inherent in a democratic society. A democratic government cannot exercise its power arbitrarily or discriminately because Art. 14 is always there to regulate its discretion in all spheres. \"The state need not enter into any contract with anyone, but if it does so, it must do so fairly without discrimination and without unfair procedure.\"83 The government cannot lay down arbitrary and capricious standards for the choice of persons with whom alone it will deal. Every action of the government must be informed with reason and should be free from arbitrariness because government is always a government.84 Bhagwati, J., has laid down the principle as follows:85 \"Where the government is dealing with the public, whether by giving of jobs or entering into contracts or issuing quotas or licences or granting other forms of largess, the government cannot act arbitrarily at its sweet will and, like a pri- vate individual, deal with any person it pleases, but its action must be in conformity with standard or norm which is not arbitrary, irrational or irrelevant.\" In Ramana,1 the International Airport Authority, a statutory body, floated a tender for running a restaurant at the Bombay Airport. Certain conditions of eligibility were laid down for the contractor. The authority awarded the contract to one who did not fulfil the norms of eligibility laid down. The Supreme Court ruled that the authority ought to have stuck to the conditions prescribed by it. The action of the authority was discriminatory as it did not give an equal chance to other persons similarly situated to tender for the contract. The Court has emphasized that when the government lays down some norms or standards of eligibility, then the government cannot award the contract to some one not fulfilling the prescribed conditions of eligibility.",

    "content": "action of the authority was discriminatory as it did not give an equal chance to other persons similarly situated to tender for the contract. The Court has emphasized that when the government lays down some norms or standards of eligibility, then the government cannot award the contract to some one not fulfilling the prescribed conditions of eligibility. If the authority does so, its action becomes discriminatory since it excludes \"other persons similarly situate from tendering for the contract\" and that would be \"plainly arbitrary and without reason\". Page 1019 Bhagwati, J., speaking for the Court has expounded the relevant principle as follows:2 \"It is well settled rule of administrative law that an executive authority must be rigorously held to the standards by which it professes its actions to be judged and it must scrupulously observe those standards on pain of invalidation of an act in violation of them\". The most notable aspect of Ramana is that it put a restriction on the discretion of the Administration to award a contract to whomsoever it likes. Instead, the exercise of the power to award contract must be structured by \"rational, relevant and non-discriminatory\" standards or norms. This means that while inviting tenders to award a contract, the norms or standards governing the tenders should be reasonable and non-discriminatory and the concerned authority should not depart from the same arbitrarily and without justification. In another case, allotment of quotas of resin by the State to industrial units was quashed as it was based on no reasonable basis.3 The principle that the state cannot act in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner in the matter of conferring or not conferring benefits on individuals and that the distribution of the largess should be reasonable has been applied in a large number of cases.4 For example, the Supreme Court has observed in Mahabir Auto Stores v. Indian Oil Corporation :5 \"It appears to us that rule of reason and rule against arbitrariness and discrimination, rules of fair play and natural justice are part of the rule of law applicable in situation or action by state instrumentality in dealing with citizens in a situation like the present one. Even though the rights of the citizens are in the nature of contractual rights, the manner, the method and motive of a decision of entering or not entering into a contract, are subject to judicial review on the touchstone of relevance and reasonableness, fair play, natural justice, equality and non-discrimination in the type of the transactions and nature of the dealing as in the present case.\" In Sterling Computers Ltd. v. M & N Publications Ltd .,6 the Supreme Court has ruled that even in commercial contracts where there is a public element it is necessary that relevant considerations are taken into account and the irrelevant considerations are kept out. In Union of India v. Graphic Industries Ltd ., 7 the Supreme Courthas held that even in contractual matters public authorities have to act fairly. In the area of exercise of contractual powers by governmental authorities, the function of the courts is to prevent arbitrariness and favouritism and to ensure that the power is exercised in public interest and not for a collateral purpose.8 The Railway Board rejected the tender of the respondent. The Supreme Court ruled that the Board had acted arbitrarily and without applying its mind while doing so. The Court characterised it as a \"flagrant violation of the constitutional mandate of Art. 14.\"9 Usually, the courts do not interfere with policy matters. But, in the instant case, the Supreme Court quashed the policy because it was framed in ignorance of the facts. The court stated : \"Any decision be it a simple administrative decision or a policy decision, of taken without considering the relevant facts, can only be termed as an arbitrary decision.\" When a term of the tender is changed after the parties have filed their offers in response thereto, it amounts to changing the rules of the game after it has begun. In such a situation, the only way out is to begin a fresh process of initial tender all over again.10 It is the settled law that no one has a fundamental right to carry on trade or business in liquor.11 In exercise of its regulatory power, the State is entitled to prohibit absolutely any form of activity in relation to an intoxicant, e.g., manufacture, possession, storage, import, export, etc. The State has the exclusive privilege to manufacture, sale, etc. of liquor. But if the State decides to part with its monopoly, then the State can regulate consistent with the principles of equality enshrined in Art. 14. The Supreme Court has observed in Doongaji & Co. v. State of Madhya Pradesh :12 \"Further when the State has decided to part with such right or privilege to the others, then State can regulate consistent with the principles of equality enshrined under Art. 14 and any infraction in this behalf at its pleasure is arbitrary Page 1020 violating Art. 14. Therefore, the exclusive right or privilege of manufacture, storage, sale, import and export of the liquor through any agency other than the State would be subject to the rigour of Art. 14....\"13 The Supreme Court has ruled recently in TVL Sundarsan Granites v. Imperial Granites Ltd .,14 that \"while grant of largess is at the discretion of the State Government, its action should be open, fair, honest and completely above board. In the instant case, grant of lease by the State in favour of a party for quarrying coloured, granite was quashed on the ground that in doing so, the State had not acted \"fairly and reasonably and had not kept public interest and mineral development in the State in view\".",

    "content": "of tehbazari by the Nagarpalika without any notice, without any auction or without any advertisement was held to be vitiated.15 After the terms and conditions for award of a contract have been announced, the concerned authority cannot go back on them otherwise it may result in undue favour to a particular person.16 Although norms and guidelines are generally to be followed, deviations for good reasons are not barred. Thus, where the guidelines issued by the RBI to bankers said that the banks should follow the broad policies contained in the guidelines relating to 'One Time Settlement' of its customers whose accounts have been classified as NPA, deviation in minor matters which does not touch the broad aspects of the policy could not be considered as violating Art. 14.17 When tenders are invited for execution of a work, the contract is awarded to the lowest tenderer which is in public interest. The principle of awarding contract to the lowest tenderer applies when all things are equal. The tender system eliminates favouritism and discrimination in awarding public works. It is also in public interest to adhere to the rules and regulations subject to which the tenders are invited. Ignoring the instructions subject to which the tenders are invited would encourage and provide scope for \"discrimination, arbitrariness and favouritism \"which are totally opposed to the Rule of Law and our constitutional values\". The very purpose of issuing Rules/instructions is to ensure their enforcement lest the Rule of Law should be a casualty\". Inclusion of an item in the schedule to the Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 1995 (made under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955) in deviation from a norm fixed in a policy decision may result in violation of Art. 14.18 But even if the regulations provide that normally allotment of land should be made by inviting applications, the authorities were not precluded in a given situation to take recourse to a regulation which enabled the authorities to make allotment to a particular company. This is because of the principle that when power exercised by a statutory authority is traceable to a provision of a statute, then in the absence of violation of any mandatory provision therein or illegality of the purpose, a decision taken in furtherance of the statute would not be interfered with.19 Hence when a high level committee presided over by the Minister authorized under rules of Executive Business framed under Article 166 considers a project and recommends an allotment of land to a company which was to undertake the project and the State Government clears the project, the requirement of consultation is satisfied. In such circumstances the competent authorities were free to evolve their own procedure.20 It was not imperative that consultation should be by exchange of letter.21 \"Merely because a bid is the lowest the requirements of compliance of rules and conditions cannot be ignored\". Also, the concerned authority is not obliged to award contract to a tenderer at the quoted price bid. The authority can always negotiate with the next lowest tenderer (in case the lowest is out for any reason) for awarding the contract on economically viable price bid.22 Section 3(1) of the Capital of Punjab (Development and Regulation) Act, 1952, grants power to the Central Government to \"sell, lease or otherwise transfer\" any land or building belonging to the government \"on such terms and conditions\" as it may think fit. The Court has ruled in the following case that the action of the Government under S. 3(1) \"is required to be fair and reasonable and not actuated by considerations which could be termed as arbitrary or discriminatory. The Government cannot act like a private individual in imposing the conditions solely with the object of extracting profits from its leassees. Governmental actions Page 1021 are required to be based on standards which are not arbitrary or unauthorised\".23 Similarly, before the government places the name of a person on the blacklist, he should be given an opportunity of hearing. Blacklisting creates a disability as it prevents the person concerned from the privilege of entering into lawful relationship with government for purposes of gain:24 Award of contract by the Government of India to a private party for development of medium size oil fields was challenged through a public interest litigation on the ground of non-application of mind. But the Court rejected the contention because on facts the contention was not substantiated. The Court also ruled that whether the oilfield was to be developed by the Oil and Natural Gas Commission on a stand alone basis was a matter of policy and the Court would not interfere with the same. If the Court is satisfied that there have been \"unreasonableness, mala fide, collateral considerations\" in awarding a contract then the Court can quash the award of contract. As to the agreed price for purchase of oil extracted from the oil field in question, the Court said that this was a highly \"technical and complex\" problem and the Court was not qualified to probe into this matter.25 A contract entered into between the Lucknow Municipal Corporation and a builder to build an underground commercial complex in a municipal park was quashed by the Supreme Court in the following case.26 The Court characterised the contract in question as being against the law and the masterplan. The contract was entered into by the corporation without calling tenders. The contract was held to be wholly unreasonable and one-sided favouring the builder. The general rule is that to dispose of public property, tenders ought to be called or a public auction held.27 The Court described the contract in the following words:28 \"A bare glance at the terms of the agreement shows that not only the clauses of the agreement are unreasonable for the Mahapalika but they are atrocious. No person of ordinary prudence shall even enter into such an agreement.",

    "content": "person of ordinary prudence shall even enter into such an agreement. Valuable land in the heart of commercial area has been handed on a platter to the builder for it to exploit and to make runaway profits.\" The Court ordered the building constructed to be demolished. The great importance of disciplining discretion of the Administration in the matter of awarding contracts cannot be lost sight of in the contemporary period. To-day the state is the source of enormous wealth. Many individuals and businesses seek largess of the government in the form of contracts, licences, leases, quotas, jobs, mineral rights, property leases, etc. There is, therefore, need to develop some norms to regulate, structure and discipline government discretion to confer such benefits. The government or any of its agencies should not be allowed to act arbitrarily and confer benefits on whomsoever they want.29 The court can, on a finding of arbitrary methodology, itself suggest curative solutions. In Ravi Development,30 the Supreme Court criticized the judgment of the High Court which held that the adoption of a particular method was arbitrary and unreasonable but the Court put across certain suggestions for the consideration of the State Government in relation to fresh notice being given regarding the method and its applicability so that all persons interested can participate on equal terms promoting healthy competition. (v) SALE OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY The basic principle is that a public authority does not have an open-end discretion to dispose of its property at whatever price it likes. The principle is that the sale should take place openly and the effort should be to get the best price.31 The several methods which can be employed for this purpose are : (i) public auction; (ii) inviting tenders for the property. As the Supreme Court has observed in State of Uttar Pradesh v. Shiv Charan Sharma :32 \"Public auction with open participation and a reserved price guarantees public interest being fully subserved.\" The Supreme Court has laid down that mineral rights ought not be granted through private negotiations but by holding a public auction where those interested in the matter may bid against each other. The Court has observed: \"Public auction with open participation and a reserved price guarantees public interest being fully subserved.\"33 Page 1022 In Haji T.M. Hassan v. Kerala Financial Corpn., 34 the Supreme Court has emphasized that public property owned by the state or its instrumentality should be sold generally by public auction or by inviting tenders. Observance of this rule not only fetches the highest price for the property but also ensures fairness in the activities of the state and public authorities. There should be no suggestion of discrimination, bias, favouritism or nepotism. But there may be situations when departure from this rule may become necessary. However, such situations must be justified by compulsions and not by compromise. It must be justified by compelling reasons and not by just convenience. Balco35 is the latest pronouncement of the Supreme Court on the disposal of government property. 51% equity in Balco, a government undertaking, was sold to a private company by inviting tenders through global advertisement. The sale was challenged on various grounds but the Supreme Court rejected all the contentions and upheld the sale. The following three main propositions emerge from the Court decision: (1) Divestment by the government in a public enterprise is a matter of economic policy which is for the government to decide. The Court does not interfere with economic policies unless there is a breach of law. (2) Sale of an undertaking to the highest bidder after global advertisement inviting tenders at a price which was way above the reserve price fixed by the government could not be said to be vitiated in any way. The procedure followed was proper. (3) The matter of fixation of the reserve price, the matter being a question of fact, the Court does not interfere unless the methodology adopted for the purpose is arbitrary. 1.

M P Jain Indian Constitutional Law/Volume 1/PART V POLITICAL AND CIVIL RIGHTS/CHAPTER XXII FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS (3) RIGHT TO EQUALITY (ii) CHAPTER XXII Fundamental Rights (3) Right to Equality (ii) A. NO DISCRIMINATION ON GROUNDS OF RELIGION ETC. Article 15(1) specifically bars the state from discriminating against any citizen of India on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth, or any of them. Article 15(2) prohibits subjection of a citizen to any disability, liability, restriction or condition on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth with regard to-- (a) access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and places of entertainment, or, (b) the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads and places of public resort maintained wholly or Page 1037 partly out of state funds or dedicated to the use of general public. Under Art. 15(3), the state is not prevented from making any special provision for women and children. Article 15(4) or Art. 29(2) does not prevent the state from making any special provisions for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.1 Provisions contained in Arts. 15 and 16 are merely enabling provisions. No citizen of India can claim reservation as a matter of right and accordingly no writ of mandamus can be issued.2 (a) ART. 15(1) Article 15(1) prohibits differentiation on certain grounds mentioned above. Commenting on Art. 15(1), the Supreme Court has observed:3 \" Art. 15(1) prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion or caste identities so as to foster national identity which does not deny pluralism of Indian culture but rather to preserve it\". Article 15(1) is an extension of Art. 14. Art 15(1) expresses a particular application of the general principle of equality embodied in Art. 14. Just as the principle of classification applies to Art. 14 so it does to Art. 15(1) as well. The combined effect of Arts. 14 and 15 is not that the state cannot pass unequal laws, but if it does pass unequal laws, the inequality must be based on some reasonable ground (Art. 14), and that, due to Art. 15(1), religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth alone is not, and cannot be, a reasonable ground for discrimination. Under Art. 15(4), the State can make special provisions for certain sections of the society as stated above. But for any section of population not falling under Art. 15(4), special provisions can be made if there is reasonable classification. The word 'discrimination' in Art. 15(1) involves an element of unfavourable bias. The use of the word 'only' in the Arts. 15(1) and 15(2) connotes that what is discountenanced is discrimination purely and solely on account of any of the grounds mentioned. A discrimination based on any of these grounds and also on other grounds is not hit by Arts. 15(1) and 15(2) though it may be hit by Art. 14.4 If religion, sex, caste, race or place of birth is merely one of the factors which the Legislature has taken into consideration, then, it would not be discrimination only on the ground of that fact. But, if the Legislature has discriminated only on one of these grounds, and no other factor could possibly have been present, then, undoubtedly, the law would offend against Art. 15(1). Further, to adjudge the validity of an Act under these Articles, a distinction is to be drawn between the object underlying the impugned Act and the mode and manner adopted therein to achieve that object. The object underlying the Act may be good or laudable but its validity has to be judged by the method of its operation and its effect on the fundamental right involved. The crucial question to ask therefore is whether the operation of the impugned Act results in a prohibition only on any of the grounds mentioned in Arts. 15(1) and 15(2). It is the effect of the impugned Act that is to be considered and if its effect is to discriminate on any of the prohibited grounds, it is bad. Article 15 is a facet of Art. 14. Like Art. 14, Art. 15(1) also covers the entire range of state activities. But, in a way, the scope of Art. 15 is narrower than that of Art. 14 in several respects. One, while Art. 14 is general in nature in the sense that it applies both to citizens as well as non-citizens, Art. 15(1) covers only the Indian citizens, and does not apply to non-citizens. No non-citizen can claim any right under Art. 15, though he can do so under Art. 14. Two, while Art. 14 permits any reasonable classification on the basis of any rational criterion, under Art. Page 1038 15(1), certain grounds mentioned therein can never form the basis of classification. The residents of Madhya Bharat were exempted from payment of a capitation fee for admission to the State medical college, while the non-residents were required to pay the same. The Supreme Court negatived the plea of discrimination by the non-residents under Art. 15(1) because the ground of exemption was 'residence' and not 'place of birth'. Residence and place of birth are two distinct concepts with different connotations. Art. 15(1) prohibits discrimination on the basis of place of birth but not residence.5 And, in the instant case, classification on the basis of 'residence' was held to be reasonable. Education is a State subject. A State spends money on the upkeep of educational institutions. There is, therefore, nothing wrong in the State if it so orders the educational system that some advantage ensures for the benefit of the State. Some of the resident students after securing their degree may settle in the State as doctors and serve the community.",

There is, therefore, nothing wrong in the State if it so orders the educational system that some advantage ensures for the benefit of the State. Some of the resident students after securing their degree may settle in the State as doctors and serve the community. Thus, the justification for the classification on the basis of residence rested on the assumption that the residents of the State would after becoming doctors settle down and serve the needs of the people of the State. In N. Vasundara v. State of Mysore6, the Supreme Court has sustained the constitutional validity of reservation based on the requirement of 'residence' within the State for the purpose of admission to medical colleges. Under the City of Bombay Police Act, while a person born outside Greater Bombay could be externed if he was convicted of any of the offences mentioned therein, no such action could be taken against a person born within Greater Bombay. This was discrimination on the basis of 'place of birth' and so was invalid under Art. 15(1).7 Under the U.P. Court of Wards Act, 1912, while a male proprietor could be declared incapable of managing his property only on one of the five grounds mentioned therein, and that too after giving him an opportunity of showing cause as to why such a declaration should not be made, a female proprietor could be declared incapable to manage her property on any ground and without giving her any show cause notice. The provision is bad as it amounts to discrimination on the ground of sex.8 A law providing for elections to municipalities on the basis of separate electorates for members of different religious communities,9 or delimitation of panchayat circles for purposes of election to a panchayat on the basis of castes, would offend Art. 15(1).10 If the office of the President of a municipality is not reserved or is meant for general category, all the candidates irrespective of their caste, class or community and irrespective of the fact whether they have been elected from a reserved ward or a general ward are entitled to seek election and contest for the office of the President of the municipality. The unreserved seats euphemistically described as general category seats are open seats available for all candidates who are otherwise qualified to contest to that office. Wherever the office of the President of a municipality is required to be filled in by a member belonging to Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe or Backward Class as the case may be, it would be enough if one belongs to one of those categories irrespective of the fact whether they have been elected from a general ward or a reserved ward.11 Acting on reports that the inhabitants of certain villages were harbouring dacoits, the Government of Rajasthan sanctioned posting of additional police in those villages. The expenses were to be borne by the villagers but the Harijan and Muslim inhabitants of these villages were exempt from this liability. This was quashed as being discriminatory on the ground of 'caste' or 'religion' as it discriminated against the peace-loving villagers other than Harijans and Muslims.12 Allotment of building sites by a municipality only to the members of a particular religion would violate Arts. 15 and 14.13 Reservation does not limit number of candidates from reserved category to be elected. They are eligible to contest from the unreserved seats and get elected resulting in increase of their representation in the local bodies.14 (b) ART. 15(2) Page 1039 Article 15(2), mentioned above, contains a prohibition of a general nature and is not confined to the state only. On the basis of this provision, it has been held that if a section of the public puts forward a claim for an exclusive use of a public well, it must establish that the well was dedicated to the exclusive use of that particular section of the public and not to the use of the general public.15 A custom to that effect cannot be held to be reasonable, or in accordance with enlightened modern notions of utility of public wells because of the force of Art. 15. In Art. 15(2) occurs the expression 'a place of public resort'. There is difference of opinion on the exact significance of this phrase. One view holds that a place is a 'place of public resort' only if the public have access to it as a matter of legal right.16 A broader view, however, regards a place of public resort as one to which members of the public are allowed access and where they habitually resort to.17 The latter view appears to be more in accord with the tenor and purpose of the constitutional provision as it would bar discrimination on a wider front. (c) PERSONAL LAWS In family matters, India has a system of personal laws, i.e. Hindu law for the Hindus, Muslim law for the Muslims and so on.18 Some of these laws have been amended by statutes; some like Muslim law has been left unamended. Challenges to these laws on the basis of religious differentiation, or on the basis of differentiation between males and females have not been accepted.19 Legislation making provisions for Hindus specifically on matters falling within the ambit of Hindu Law has been upheld even though similar provisions have not been made for other groups. A law introducing monogamy among the Hindus, but leaving the Muslims free to take any number of wives, was upheld against the charge of discrimination on the ground of 'religion' only. The court pointed out that the Hindus have been enjoying for long their own indigenous system based on Hindu scriptures in the same way as the Mohammedans were subject to their own personal law.20 The Supreme Court has taken the stand that personal laws are immune from being challenged under Fundamental Rights which do not touch upon these laws.",

    "content": "laws fall outside the scope of the Fundamental Rights.21 This seems to be a policy, rather than a legalistic, approach as the courts do not want to adjudicate upon aspects of these systems of laws which would not be able to stand the test of Fundamental Rights. The court desires that Parliament ought to deal with these matters in a rational manner. Section 15(2)(b) of the Hindu Succession Act has been held to be not invalid on the ground of discrimination on the basis of sex. According to the Bombay High Court, the true principle is that the community governed by the given personal law itself forms a recognised class, and that itself a reasonable class of persons, for testing the given legislation and the same has to be examined in the background of the principles by which such class is governed by the tenets of its personal law. If those principles are otherwise reasonable in the context of the history of the given system of personal law, then the challenge is hardly maintainable. The court has made this statement in the context of new legislation enacted to modify personal laws.22 The Andhra Pradesh High Court declared S. Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act which provides for the restitution of conjugal rights as invalid on the ground that, in practice, it works against the females and not against the males.23The court argued that sexual cohabitation is an inseparable ingredient of a decree of restitution of conjugal rights. To have sex with an unwilling party against her will offends the inviolability of the body and mind. S. Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act infringes Art. 14 for two reasons: (1)S. 9 does not satisfy the traditional classification test. Although, on its face, S. 9 makes the remedy of restitution of conjugal rights available to both, husband and wife, in practice, it is almost exclusively invoked by the husband against his wife, and so the remedy becomes partial and one-sided. (2) S. 9 fails to pass the test of minimum rationality required by any statute law. It subserves no social good and promotes no legitimate public purpose. On the other hand, the Delhi High Court has upheld the constitutional validity of S. Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act.24 The court has said that restitution aims at cohabitation and consortium and not merely at sexual intercourse. Agreeing with the Delhi High Court, in Saroj Rani v. Sudarshan Kumar25, the Supreme Page 1040 Court has held the provision to be valid vis-a-vis Arts. 14 and 21.26 The court has emphasized that one must see the decree of restitution of conjugal rights in its proper perspective. In India, conjugal rights, i.e., the right of the husband or wife to the society of the other is not merely a creature of the statute; it is inherent in the very institution of marriage itself. There are sufficient safeguards in S. 9 to prevent it from becoming tyrannical. S. 9 is only a codification of the pre-existing law. Only when the decree is disobeyed wilfully, the court may order attachment of property. \"It serves a social purpose as an aid to the prevention of break-up of marriage.\" Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act confers legitimacy on children born out of a void marriage. The section has been held validvis-a-vis Art. 14 as it treats all illegitimate children similarly circumstanced as forming one class for conferment of legitimacy.27 Under S. 6(a)of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956, the father of a Hindu minor is the only guardian and the mother of the minor is relegated to an inferior position. She could become the guardian only 'after' the father. The provision was challenged under Arts. 14 and 15 on the ground of gender discrimination. The argument was that the mother was relegated to an inferior position on the ground of 'gender' alone as her right, as a natural guardian of the minor, is made cognisable only 'after' the father. The Supreme Courtagreed with the premise that 'gender equality' is one of the basic principles of the Constitution. If the word 'after' in S. 6(a) were to be interpreted to mean that the mother was disqualified to act as the guardian of the minor during the father's lifetime, and that she could act as such only after his death, then the same would definitely run counter to the basic requirement of the Constitutional mandate as it would lead to differentiation between male and female. But the provision in question could be so interpreted as to make it compatible with Art. 14. Accordingly, the Court interpreted S. 6 so as to mean that the mother could act as the natural guardian of the minor during the father's lifetime if the father was not in actual charge of the affairs of the minor. Similar interpretation was given to S. 19(b) of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890.28 Under S. Section 10, Divorce Act, 1869, a Christian husband can get divorce from his wife on the ground of her adulterysimpliciter. On the other hand, a Christian wife to get divorce from her husband has to prove not only his adultery but also something more, such as, adultery, incest, bigamy, rape, cruelty or desertion. The Bombay High Court has ruled in Pragati Varghese v. Cyril George Varghese, 29 that S. 10 is discriminatory on the ground of sex and is, thus, violative of Art. 15(1). Further, a Christian woman cannot seek divorce on the grounds of cruelty and desertion while women under other systems can do so. This is discrimination based merely on the ground of religion and this is also violative of Arts. 14 and 15. The validity of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights and Divorce) Act, 1986, was challenged on the ground that the Act, when compared with s. 125,Cr. P.C., is discriminatory against Muslim divorcee women. But theSupreme Court negatived the contention.",

The validity of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights and Divorce) Act, 1986, was challenged on the ground that the Act, when compared with s. 125,Cr. P.C., is discriminatory against Muslim divorcee women. But theSupreme Court negatived the contention. The Court has ruled that the purpose of both laws is the same viz., to meet a situation where a divorced woman is likely to be led into destitution and vagrancy. The Muslim Act codifies and regulates the obligations due to a Muslim woman divorcee but puts her outside s. 125,Cr. P.C., The Court interpreting s. 3(1)(a) of the Act benevolently has stated that the provision means that in addition to mehr and maintenance to her during the iddat period, the husband is also obligated to make \"a reasonable and fair provision\" as provided for under s. 3(3)consistent with the needs of the divorced woman, the means of the husband, and the standard of living the woman enjoyed during her married life. Thus, interpreted, the scheme contained in the impugned Act is equally, if not more, beneficial to the Muslim women than s. 125 , Cr.P.C.30 A law applicable to Hindu religious endowments only, and not to charitable and religious endowments belonging to other religions, has been upheld. Classification of religious endowments as Hindu, Muslim or Christian is neither arbitrary nor unreasonable keeping in view the purpose of the Act, viz., the better management of institutions. The distinction has existed for over a century and was not being made for the first time. The incidents and nature of the endowments belonging to different religious groups differ in several respects, and the classification cannot be said to be based solely on religion as the institutions included in the Act were both religious and secular, and keeping in view the object of the Act, the institutions having several common features can be classified under one group.31 Page 1041 B. ART. 15(3) : WOMEN AND CHILDREN Articles 15(3) and 15(4) constitute exceptions to Arts. 15(1) and 15(2). According to Art. 15(3), the state is not prevented from making any \"special provision\" for women and children. Articles 15(1) and 15(2) prevent the state from making any discriminatory law on the ground of gender alone. The Constitution is thus characterised by gender equality. The Constitution insists on equality of status and it negates gender bias. Nevertheless, by virtue of Art. 15(3), the state is permitted, despite Art. 15(1), to make any special provision for women, thus carving out a permissible departure from the rigours of Art. 15(1). Articles 15 and 16 do not prohibit special treatment of women. The constitutional mandate is infringed only where the females would have received same treatment with males but for their sex. In English law 'but-for-sex\" test has been developed to mean that no less favourable treatment is to be given to women on gender based criterion which would favour the opposite sex and women will not be deliberately selected for less favourable treatment because of their sex. The Constitution does not prohibit the employer to consider sex in making the employment decisions where this is done pursuant to a properly or legally charted affirmative action plan.32 Article 15(3) recognises the fact that the women in India have been socially and economically handicapped for centuries and, as a result thereof, they cannot fully participate in the socio-economic activities of the nation on a footing of equality. The purpose of Art. 15(3) is to eliminate this socio-economic backwardness of women and to empower them in such a manner as to bring about effective equality between men and women. The object of Art. 15(3) is to strengthen and improve the status of women. Art. 15(3) thus relieves the state from the bondage of Art. 15(1) and enables it to make special provisions to accord socio-economic equality to women.33 The scope of Art. 15(3) is wide enough to cover the entire range of state activity including that of employment. Art. 15(3) is a special provision in the nature of a proviso qualifying the general guarantees contained in Arts. 14, 15(1), 15(2), 16(1) and 16(2).34 A doubt has been raised whether Art. 15(3) saves any provision concerning women, or saves only such a provision as is in their favour.35 The better view would appear to be that while the state can make laws containing special provisions for women and children, it should not discriminate against them on the basis of their gender only. This appears to be the cumulative effect of Arts. 15(1) and 15(3). Although there can be no discrimination in general on the basis of sex, the Constitution itself provides for special provisions being made for women and children by virtue of Art. 15(3). Reading Arts. 15(3) and 15(1) together, it seems to be clear that while the state may discriminate in favour of women against men, it may not discriminate in favour of men against women. However, only such provisions can be made in favour of women under Art. 15(3) as are reasonable and which do not altogether obliterate or render illusory the constitutional guarantee mentioned in Art. 15(2). The operation of Art. 15(3) can be illustrated by the following few cases: (a) Under S. 497,I.P.C., the offence of adultery can be committed only by a male and not by a female who cannot even be punished as an abettor. As this provision makes a special provision for women, it is saved by Art. 15(3). TheSupreme Court has observed:36 \"Sex is a sound classification and although there can be no discrimination in general on that ground the Constitution itself provides for special provisions in the case of women and children by clause (3) of Art. 15. Arts. 14 and 15 thus read together validate the last sentence of Section 497,I.P.C., which prohibits the women from being punished as an abettor of the offence of adultery.\" Upholding S.",

Arts. 14 and 15 thus read together validate the last sentence of Section 497,I.P.C., which prohibits the women from being punished as an abettor of the offence of adultery.\" Upholding S. 497, the Bombay High Court had said in an earlier case that the discrimination made by S. 497 is based not on the fact that women have a sex different from that of men, but \"women in this country were so situated that special legislation was required in order to protect them.\"37 Page 1042 (b) The discretionary nature of the power of judicial review is illustrated when the Supreme Court even after finding that the reservation policy of the State Government in force was contrary to Arts. 14, 15 and 16 took into consideration the fact that a large number of young girls below the age of 10 years were taught in primary schools and that it would be preferable that such young girls are taught by women and held that reservation of 50% in favour of female candidates was justified.38 In the matter of distribution of state largesse where dealership of retail outlets of petrol pumps were reserved for women, financial capacity and ability to provide infrastructure and facilities are not relevant and material criteria when the instrumentality of the State is providing finance and the concerned outlet site is owned and retail outlet is to be operated by such instrumentality.39 (c) Where a female employee's grievance was the writing of a sensuous letter expressing love to her, admiring her qualities and beauty, and extending unsolicited help, it was held that the female employee's grievance ought to have been looked into according to the directions given in Vishaka Case.40 (d) S. 497 , Cr.P.C., 1898, prohibited release of a person accused of a capital offence on bail except a woman or a child under 16 or a sick man. The provision has been held valid as it metes out a special treatment to women which is consistent with Art. 15(3). The Rajasthan High Court observed:41 \"The State may make laws containing special provisions for women and children, but no discrimination can be made against them on account of their sex alone.\" (e) In Walter Alfred Baid, Sister Tutor (Nursing) Irwin Hospital v. Union of India, 42 a rule making male candidates ineligible for the post of Senior Tutor in the School of Nursing was held to be violative of Art. 16(2) and was not saved by Art. 15(3). The Delhi High Court took the view that the matter relating to employment falls under Art. 16 and not under Art. 15(3). \"The equality of opportunity in the matter of employment between the sexes and the corresponding prohibition against discrimination is absolute in nature and no exception has been carved out of it in Art. 16 unlike in Art. 15.\" The Court refused to read Art. 15(3) into Art. 16 so as to restrict the scope of the prohibition contained in Art. 16(2).43 (f) On the other hand, the Punjab & Haryana High Court took a different view in Shamsher Singh v. State of Punjab .44 A rule granting a special allowance to the women principals working in a wing of the Punjab Educational Services was challenged on the ground that their male counterparts were not given the same benefit although both performed identical duties and were part of the same service. The constitutional validity of the rule was challenged under Art. 16(2). The High Court upheld the impugned rule under Art. 15(3), holding that even though the discrimination was based on the ground of sex, it was saved by Art. 15(3). The court ruled that Art. 15(3) could be invoked for construing and determining the scope of Art. 16(2). According to the court, Art. 15(3) extends to the entire field of state activity, including the field of public employment which has been specifically dealt with in Art. 16. The Court stated that if a particular provision squarely falls within the ambit of Art. 15(3), it cannot be struck down merely because it may also amount to discrimination solely on the basis of sex. \" Articles 14, 15 and 16, being the constituents of a single code of constitutional guarantees, supplementing each other, clause (3) of Article 15 can be invoked for construing and determining the scope of Art. 16(2).\" The Court however ruled that \"only such special provisions in favour of women can be made under Article 15(3), which are reasonable and do not altogether obliterate or render illusory the constitutional guarantee enshrined in Article 16(2).\" (g) A rule was made by the Punjab Government rendering women ineligible for posting in the Page 1043 men's jails except for the posts of clerks and matrons. Thus, a woman could not be appointed as the Superintendent of Jails. This rule was challenged as being discriminatory on the ground of sex only. The High Court rejected the challenge in Raghubans Saudagar Singh v. State of Punjab .45 The High Court held, \"if the sex added a variety of other factors and considerations form a reasonable nexus for the object of classification then the bar of Arts. 15 and 16(2) cannot possibly be attracted.\" The court said that, testing the proposition in reverse, the state may for identical considerations exclude men from the post of warden and other jail officials who may have to come in direct and close contact with the women inmates of such a jail. (h) There existed a common cadre of Probation Officers for males and females. However, for the post of the Head of the Institute for destitute women, only females were regarded as eligible.

    "content": "There existed a common cadre of Probation Officers for males and females. However, for the post of the Head of the Institute for destitute women, only females were regarded as eligible. This was challenged as being discriminatory. In B.R. Acharya v. State of Gujarat, 46 the High Court said that only because there was a common cadre, in which the officers of both sexes were appointed, it did not mean that all posts in the higher cadre must also be filled in by persons belonging to both the sexes. Keeping in view the nature of duties to be performed, the State Government may decide that only a woman will head a women's institution. Art. 15(3) enables the State to make any special provision for women and children and so the impugned rule could not be held to be unconstitutional. (i) The Bombay Government enacted a statutory provision reserving a few seats for women in the municipalities. The provision was challenged as discriminatory. Rejecting the challenge in Dattatraya v. Motiram More, 47 the High Court pointed out that whereas under Art. 15(1) discrimination in favour of men only on the ground of sex is not permissible, by reason of Art. 15(3), the State may discriminate in favour of women without offending Art. 15(1). The court went to state: \"Even if in making special provision for women for giving them reserved seats the State has discriminated against men, by reason of Art. 15(3) the Constitution has permitted the State to do so even though the provision may result in discrimination only on the ground of sex.\" (j) The most significant pronouncement on Art. 15(3) is the recent Supreme Court case Government of Andhra Pradesh v. P.B. Vijay Kumar.48 The Supreme Court has ruled in the instant case that under Art. 15(3), the State may fix a quota for appointment of women in government services. Also, a rule saying that all other things being equal, preference would be given to women to the extent of 30% of the posts was held valid with reference to Art. 15(3). It was argued that reservation of posts or appointments for any backward class is permissible under Art. 16(2) but not for women and so no reservation can be made in favour of women as it would amount to discrimination on the ground of sex in public employment which would be violative of Art. 16(2). Rejecting this argument, the Supreme Court has ruled that posts can be reserved for women under Art. 15(3) as it is much wider in scope and covers all state activities. While Art. 15(1) prohibits the State from making any discrimination inter alia on the ground of sex alone, by virtue of Art. 15(3), the State may make special provisions for women. Thus, Art. 15(3) clearly carves out a permissible departure from the rigours of Art. 15(1). The Court has emphasized that an important limb of the concept of gender equality is creating job opportunities for women. Making special provisions for women in respect of employment or posts under the state is an integral part of Art. 15(3). \"To say that under Art. 15(3), job opportunities for women cannot be created would be to cut at the very root of the underlying inspiration behind this Article. Making special provisions for women in respect of employment or posts under the state is an integral part of Article 15(3).\"49 This power conferred by Art. 15(3) is Page 1044 not whittled down in any manner by Art. 16.50 What does the expression \"special provision\" for women mean? The \"special provision\" which the state may make to improve women's participation in all activities under the supervision and control of the state can be in the form of either affirmative action or reservation. Thus, Art. 15(3) includes the power to make reservations for women. Talking about the provision giving preference to women, the Court has said that this provision does not make any reservation for women. It amounts to affirmative action. It operates at the initial stage of appointment and when men and women candidates are equally meritorious. Under Art. 15(3), both reservation and affirmative action are permissible in connection with employment or posts under the state. Art. 15 is designed to create an egalitarian society. The Supreme Court has explained the relationship between Arts. 15 and 16 as follows. Art. 15 deals with every kind of state action in relation to Indian citizens. Every sphere of state activity is controlled by Art. 15(1) and, therefore, there is no reason to exclude from the ambit of Art. 15(1) employment under the state. Art. 15(3) permits special provisions for women. Arts. 15(1) and 15(3) go together. In addition to Art. 15(1), Art. 16(1) places certain additional prohibitions in respect of a specific area of state activity, viz., employment under the state. These are in addition to the grounds of prohibition enumerated under Art. 15(1) which are also included under Art. 16(2). The Court has observed: \"Therefore, in dealing with employment under the state, it has to bear in mind both Arts. 15 and 16 the former being a more general provision and the latter, a more specific provision. Since Art. 16 does not touch upon any special provision for women being made by the state, it cannot in any manner derogate from the power conferred upon the state in this connection under Art. 15(3). This power conferred by Art. 15(3) is wide enough to cover the entire range of state activity including employment under the state.\" It may be noted that Art. 16(2) is more limited in scope than Art. 15(1) as it is confined to employment or office under the state. The prohibited grounds of discrimination under Art. 16(2) are somewhat wider than those under Art. 15(2) because Art. 16(2) prohibits discrimination on the additional grounds of descent and residence apart from religion, caste, sex and place of birth.",

(k) The Punjab University made a rule barring a male lecturer from being appointed as Principal in a Girls' College. The constitutional validity of the rule was challenged and the High Court by a majority of 3:2 held the rule to be unconstitutional. While the minority view was that the said rule fell, and was justified, under Art. 15(3), the majority ruled that the rule in question did not fall under Art. 15(3) and that the rule was discriminatory on the basis of sex. The majority applied a qualitative test to the rule. The majority opined that discrimination can be made in favour of women under Art. 15(3) if it is found that the women are not equal with the men and are lagging behind the men in the field where reservation is sought to be made. As and when any reservation is made in favour of women, the same is to be tested on the ground of reasonableness. The state has to prima facie justify the grounds for making the reservation. In the instant case, it was held by the majority that there was no principle or criterion involved in denying the post of the Principal of a Girls' College to a male when males could be appointed as teachers and heads of departments in such colleges. The functions of Principal are mostly administrative in nature and there is no bar in a female being appointed as the Principal of a Boys' College.51 If separate colleges or schools for girls are justifiable, rules providing appointment of a lady Principal or teacher would also be justified. The object sought to be achieved is a precautionary, preventive and protective measure based on public morals and particularly in view of the young age of the girl students to be taught. Hence, rules empowering the authority to appoint only a lady principal or a lady teacher or a lady doctor or a woman Superintendent are not violative of Articles 14, 15 or 16.52 Page 1045 C. ARTICLE 15(4) : BACKWARD CLASSES Article 15(1) would have come in the way of making favourable provisions for backward sections of society. This can be illustrated by referring to two cases. The Madras Government issued an order [popularly known as the Communal G.O] allotting seats in the State medical colleges community-wise as follows: Non-Brahmin (Hindus) 6; Backward Hindus, 2; Brahmins, 2; Harijans, 2; Anglo-Indians and Indian Christians, 1; Muslims, 1. This G.O. was declared invalid because it classified students merely on the basis of 'caste' and 'religion' irrespective of their merit.53 A seven Judge Bench of the Supreme Court struck down the classification as being based on caste, race and religion for the purpose of admission to educational institutions on the ground that Art. 15 did not contain a clause such as Art. 16(4). In another case, a government order requisitioning land for construction of a colony for harijans was held to be discriminatory under Art. 15(1) because the facilities were being given to them as a 'community' as such when other members of the public were equally in need of similar facilities.54 To tide over the difficulties created by such decisions in the way of helping backward classes by making discriminatory provisions in their favour, Art. 15(4) was added to the Constitution in 1951. Art. 15(4) says that the state is not prevented from making any special provisions for \"the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes\". Thus, an order acquiring land for constructing a colony for harijans is now valid under Art. 15(4).55 Art. 15(4) does not justify grant of special remission to the prisoners of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and not to others. The grant of remission of convicted prisoners belonging to these classes can hardly be said to be a measure for the \"advancement\" of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.56 It may be noted that the Constitution makes a few more provisions for development and amelioration of the condition of these classes of people which are discussed later at the appropriate places.57 Article 15(4) confers a discretion and does not create any constitutional duty or obligation. Hence no mandamus can be issued either to provide for reservation or for relaxation.58 Under Art. 15(4), in innumerable cases,59 the reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Backward Classes in engineering, medical and other technological colleges has been upheld. Reservations are possible under Art. 15(4) for the advancement of any backward class of citizens or for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Rejecting the argument that Art. 15(4) envisages \"positive action\" while Art. 16(4)60 is a provision warranting programmes of \"positive discrimination\", the Supreme Court has observed in Indra Sawhney v. Union of India :61 \"We are afraid we may not be able to fit these provisions into this kind of compartmentalisation in the context and scheme of our constitutional provisions. By now, it is well settled that reservation in educational institutions and other walks of life can be provided under Art. 15(4) just as reservations can be provided in services under Art. 16(4). If so, it would not be correct to confine Art. 15(4) to programmes of positive action alone. Art. 15(4) is wider than Art. 16(4) is as much as several kinds of positive action programmes can also be evolved and implemented thereunder (in addition to reservations) to improve the conditions of SEBCs (Socially and Educationally Backward Classes), Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, whereas Art. 16(4) speaks only of one type of remedial measure, namely, reservation of appointments/posts.\" The scope of Art. 15(4) is wider than Art. 16(4).

Art. 15(4) covers within it several kinds of positive action programmes in addition to reservations. However, reservation of posts and appointments must be within reasonable limits, viz., 50% at the maximum. The same limit applies to Art. 15(3). Reservation to a backward class is not a constitutional mandate, but a prerogative of the State.62 Reservation for a backward class is not a constitutional mandate. The provisions of Articles 330(1)(b) and (c) show that the Constitution has treated Scheduled Tribes in the autonomous districts of Assam as a separate category distinct from all other Scheduled Tribes. This clearly indicates that when the Constitution makers Page 1046 wanted to make a subclassification of Scheduled Tribes, they have themselves made it in the text of the Constitution itself and have not empowered any legislature or Government to make such a subclassification.63 In Chinnaiah64 the Court also said that Art. 341 indicates that there can be only one list of Scheduled Castes in regard to a State and that list should include all specified castes, races or tribes or part or groups notified in that Presidential List. In the entire Constitution wherever reference has been made to \"Scheduled Castes\" it refers only to the list prepared by the President under Article 341 and there is no reference to any subclassification or division in the said list except, may be, for the limited purpose of Article 330. Therefore, it is clear that the Constitution intended all the castes including the subcastes, races and tribes mentioned in the list to be members of one group for the purpose of the Constitution and this group cannot be subdivided for any purpose. The constitution intended that all the castes included in the Schedule under Article 341 would be deemed to be one class of persons. The principles laid down in Indra Sawhney case,65 for subclassification of other Backward Classes cannot be applied as a precedent for subclassification or subgrouping Scheduled Castes in the Presidential List because that very judgment itself has specifically held that subdivision of other backward classes is not applicable to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. This is for the obvious reason i.e. the Constitution itself has kept the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes List out of interference by the State Government.66 A woman who by birth did not belong to a backward class or community, would not be entitled to contest a seat reserved for a backward class community merely on the basis of her marriage to a male of that community.67 The validity of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Provision of Transfer of Certain Lands Act, 1978) which restricted the transfer by SC or ST of any land granted to them for particular period of time (e.g. 3 years) has been upheld because of their poverty, lack of education and backwardness which was exploited by the stronger section of the society was not unreasonable and hence not violative of Art. 19(1)(f) of the Constitution. If the object of reservation is to take affirmative action in favour of a class which is socially, educationally and economically backward, the State's jurisdiction while exercising its executive or legislative power is to decide as to what extent reservation should be made for them either in public service or for obtaining admission in educational institutions. Having already fulfilled this part of its constitutional obligation, such a class cannot be subdivided so as to give more preference to a minuscule proportion of the Scheduled Castes in preference to other members of the same class. It is not open to the State to subclassify a class already recognized by the Constitution and allot a portion of the already reserved quota amongst the State created subclass within the list of scheduled casts. Furthermore, the emphasis on efficient administration placed by Art. 335 of the Constitution must also be considered when the claims of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to employment in the services of the Union are to be considered. Since the State had already allotted 15% of the total quota of the reservation available for backward classes to the Scheduled Castes the question of allotting any reservation under the impugned Act to the backward classes did not arise. The very fact that a legal fiction has been created is itself suggestive of the fact that the legislature of a State cannot take any action which would be contrary to or inconsistent therewith. The very idea of placing different castes or tribes or group or part thereof in a State as a conglomeration by way of a deeming definition clearly suggests that they are not to be subdivided or sub-classified further. An uniform yardstick must be adopted for giving benefits to the members of the Scheduled Castes for the purpose of the Constitution. For the purpose of identifying backwardness, a further inquiry can be made by appointing a commission as to who amongst the members of the Scheduled Castes is more backward. If benefits of reservation are not percolating to them equitably, measures should be taken to see that they are given such adequate or additional training so as to enable them to compete with the others but the same would not mean that in the process of rationalizing the reservation to the Scheduled Castes the constitutional mandate of Articles 14, 15 and 16 could be violated.",

    "content": "must be considered from the social objective angle, having regard to the constitutional scheme, and not as a political issue and, thus, adequate representation must be given to the members of the Scheduled Castes as a group and not to two or more groups of persons or members of castes.68 As regards the identification of the \"Scheduled Castes\" and \"Scheduled Tribes\", reference is to be made to Page 1047 Arts. 341 and 342. These constitutional provisions are discussed later in this book.69 (a) SOCIALLY AND EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD CLASSES A major difficulty raised by Art. 15(4) is regarding the determination of who are 'socially and educationally backward classes.' This is not a simple matter as sociological and economic considerations come into play in evolving proper criteria for its determination. Art. 15(4) lays down no criteria to designate 'backward classes'; it leaves the matter to the state to specify backward classes, but the courts can go into the question whether the criteria used by the state for the purpose are relevant or not. The question of defining backward classes has been considered by the Supreme Court in a number of cases. On the whole, the Supreme Court's approach has been that state resources are limited; protection to one group affects the constitutional rights of other citizens to demand equal opportunity, and efficiency and public interest have to be maintained in public services because it is implicit in the very idea of reservation that a less meritorious person is being preferred to a more meritorious person. The Court also seeks to guard against the perpetuation of the caste system in India and the inclusion of advance classes within the term backward classes. From the several judicial pronouncements concerning the definition of backward classes, several propositions emerge. First, the backwardness envisaged by Art. 15(4) is both social and educational and not either social or educational. This means that a class to be identified as backward should be both socially and educationally backward.70 In Balaji, the Court equated the \"social and educational backwardness\" to that of the \"Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes\". The Court observed: \"It was realised that in the Indian society there were other classes of citizens who were equally, or may be somewhat less, backward than the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and it was thought that some special provision ought to be made even for them.\" Secondly, poverty alone cannot be the test of backwardness in India because by and large people are poor and, therefore, large sections of population would fall under the backward category and thus the whole object of reservation would be frustrated.71 Thirdly, backwardness should be comparable, though not exactly similar, to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Fourthly, 'caste' may be a relevant factor to define backwardness, but it cannot be the sole or even the dominant criterion. If classification for social backwardness were to be based solely on caste, then the caste system would be perpetuated in the Indian society.72 Also this test would break down in relation to those sections of society which do not recognise caste in the conventional sense as known to the Hindu society. Fifthly, poverty, occupations, place of habitation, all contribute to backwardness and such factors cannot be ignored. Sixthly, backwardness may be defined without any reference to caste. As the Supreme Court has emphasized, Art. 15(4) \"does not speak of castes, but only speaks of classes\", and that 'caste' and 'class' are not synonymous. Therefore, exclusion of caste to ascertain backwardness does not vitiate classification if it satisfies other tests. (b) BALAJI After the enactment of the above mentioned first Constitutional Amendment in 1951, Balaji was the first case which came up before the Supreme Court.73 An order of the Mysore Government issued under Art. 15(4) reserved seats for admission to the State medical and engineering colleges for Backward classes and 'more' Backward classes. This was in addition to the reservation of seats for the Scheduled Castes (15%) and for the Scheduled Tribes (3%). Backward and more Backward classes were designated on the basis of 'castes' and 'communities'. Page 1048 The Supreme Court characterised Art. 15(4) as an exception to Art. 15(1) [as well as to Art. 29(2)].74 The Court stated--\"there is no doubt that Art. 15(4) has to be read as a proviso or an exception to Arts. 15(1) and 29(2)\". The Court declared the order bad on several grounds in Balaji v. State of Mysore75. The first defect in the Mysore order was that it was based solely on caste without regard to other relevant factors and this was not permissible under Art. 15(4). Though caste in relation to Hindus could be a relevant factor to consider in determining the social backwardness of a class of citizens, it must not be made the sole and dominant test in that behalf. Christians, Jains and Muslims do not believe in the caste system and, therefore, the test of caste could not be applied to them. In as much as identification of all backward classes under the impugned order had been made solely on the basis of caste, the order was bad. \"Social backwardness is in the ultimate analysis the result of poverty to a very large extent.\" Secondly, the test adopted by the State to measure educational backwardness was the basis of the average of student-population in the last three high school classes of all high schools in the State in relation to a thousand citizens of that community. This average for the whole State was 6.9 per thousand. The Court stated that assuming that the test applied was rational and permissible to judge educational backwardness, it was not validly applied. Only a community well below the State average could properly be regarded as backward, but not a community which came near the average.",

    "content": "Court stated that assuming that the test applied was rational and permissible to judge educational backwardness, it was not validly applied. Only a community well below the State average could properly be regarded as backward, but not a community which came near the average. The vice of the Mysore order was that it included in the list of backward classes, castes or communities whose average was slightly above, or very near, or just below the State average, e.g., Lingayats with an average of 7.1 per cent were mentioned in the list of backward communities. Thirdly, the Court declared that Art. 15(4) does not envisage classification between 'backward' and 'more backward classes' as was made by the Mysore order. Art. 15(4) authorises special provisions being made for really backward classes and not for such classes as were less advanced than the most advanced classes in the State. By adopting the technique of classifying communities into backward and more backward classes, 90 per cent of the total State population had been treated as backward. The order, in effect, sought to divide the State population into the most advanced and the rest, and put the latter into two categories--backward and more backward--and the classification of the two categories was not envisaged by Art. 15(4). \"The interests of weaker sections of society which are a first charge on the State and the Centre have to be adjusted with the interests of the community as a whole. The adjustment of these competing claims is undoubtedly a difficult matter, but if under the guise of making a special provision, a State reserves practically all the seats available in all the colleges, that clearly would be subverting the object of Art. 15(4).\" The State has \"to approach its task objectively and in a rational manner.\" In Balaji, the Supreme Court could sense the danger in treating 'caste' as the sole criterion for determining social and educational backwardness. The importance of the judgment lies in realistically appraising the situation when the Court said that economic backwardness would provide a much more reliable yardstick for determining social backwardness because more often educational backwardness is the outcome of social backwardness. The Court drew distinction between 'caste' and 'class'. An attempt at finding a new basis for ascertaining social and educational backwardness in place of caste is reflected in the Balaji decision. The Court also ruled that reservation under Art. 15(4) should be reasonable. It should not be such as to defeat or nullify the main rule of equality enshrined in Art. 15(1). While it would not be possible to predicate the exact permissible percentage of reservation it can be stated in a general and broad way that it ought to be less than 50%; \"how much less than 50% would depend upon the relevant prevailing circumstances in each case\". Also a provision under Art. 15(4) need not be in the form of a law, it could as well be made by an executive order. (c) AFTER BALAJI An order saying that a family whose income was less than Rs. 1,200 per year, and which followed such occupations as agriculture, petty business, inferior services, crafts etc. would be treated as 'backward', was declared to be valid in Chitralekha v. State of Mysore76. Here two factors--economic condition and profession--were taken into account to define backwardness, but caste was ignored for the purpose. Page 1049 In Balaji, the Supreme Court had mentioned caste as one of the relevant factors for determining social backwardness. The order in the instant case was challenged on the ground that caste had been completely ignored for the purpose. The Supreme Court ruled that though caste is a relevant circumstance in ascertaining backwardness of a class, there is nothing to preclude the authority concerned from determining social backwardness of a group of citizens if it could do so without reference to caste. Identification or classification of backward classes on the basis of occupation-cum-income, without reference to caste is not bad and would not offend Art. 15(4). Subba Rao, J., speaking for the majority of the Constitution Bench stated: \"..........What we intend to emphasize is that under no circumstances a 'class' can be equated to a 'caste', though the caste of an individual or a group of individuals may be considered along with other relevant factors in putting him in particular class. We would also like to make it clear that if in a given situation caste is excluded in ascertaining a class within the meaning of Art. 15(4) of the Constitution, it does not vitiate the classification if it satisfied other tests.\" In course of time, the judicial view has undergone some change in this respect and 'caste' as a factor to assess backwardness has been given somewhat more importance than in Balaji. The Supreme Court has taken note of the fact that there are numerous castes in the country which are backward socially and educationally and the state has to protect their interests. A caste is also a 'class' of citizens and, therefore, if an entire caste is found to be socially and educationally backward, as a fact, on the basis of relevant data and material, then inclusion of the caste as such would not violate Art. 15(1). When backwardness is defined with reference to castes, the Court wants to be satisfied that not 'caste' alone, but other factors have also been considered for the purpose. On this basis, the Court upheld a Madras order defining backward classes mainly with reference to castes. Looking at the history as to how the list had come to be formulated, the Court felt satisfied that caste was not taken as the sole basis of backwardness; the main criterion for inclusion in the list was social and educational backwardness of the castes based on their occupations.",

    "content": "were only a compendious indication of the classes of people found to be socially and educationally backward.77 In Rajendran,78 Wanchoo, C.J., speaking for the Constitution Bench pointed out that \"if the reservation in question had been based only on caste and had not taken into account the social and educational backwardness of the caste in question, it would be violative of Art. 15(1). But it must not be forgotten that a caste is also a class of citizens and if the caste as a whole is socially and educationally backward, reservation can be made in favour of such a caste on the ground that it is a socially and educationally backward class of citizens within the meaning of Art. 15(4).\" Similarly, in Balaram,79 a list prepared by the Backward Classes Commission appointed by the Andhra Government was held valid even though backward classes were enumerated mainly by their caste names because the Court found that the Commission had prepared the list after a detailed enquiry and applying several tests like general poverty, occupations, caste and educational backwardness. The Court felt satisfied that the Commission had enough material before it to be satisfied that the persons included in the list were really socially and educationally backward. But where list was prepared solely with reference to castes, and no material was placed before the Court to show that other factors besides caste had been considered in preparing it, the list was quashed as violative of Art. 15(1).80 The Court observed in Sagar, \"In determining whether a particular section forms a class, caste cannot be excluded altogether. But in the determination of a class a test solely based upon the caste or community cannot also be accepted.\"81 The judicial approach that castes may be listed as backward classes provided they are found to be backward on the basis of some factors other than mere 'caste', may possibly be more practical in the context of the facts of the Indian life. But there is no doubt that this dilutes, to some extent, the Balaji approach. The danger in this judicial thinking is that it will give a lease of life to the caste system in India, and the quest for formulae to define backwardness, delinked from the caste system, will recede into the background. In this way, the goal of evolving a casteless society in India in the foreseeable future will receive a set back. A government order excluded the candidates belonging to socially and educationally backward classes from claiming the benefit of reservation if the aggregate annual family income was Rs. 10,000 or over. The order was challenged by a candidate belonging to the backward class, but who was denied the privilege of Page 1050 preferential admission to medical college because her family income exceeded Rs. 10,000 annually. The Supreme Court emphasized in K.S. Jayasree v. State of Kerala, 82 that social backwardness is the result of caste and poverty. Poverty or economic standard is a relevant factor in determining backwardness, but cannot be the sole determining factor. Caste cannot also be the sole or dominant test for the purpose. \"Caste and poverty are both relevant for determining the backwardness. But neither caste alone nor poverty alone will be the determining tests\". Both of these factors are relevant to determine backwardness. \"Social backwardness which results from poverty is likely to be magnified by caste considerations\". Occupations, place of habitation may also be relevant factors for the purpose. With the improvement in economic position of a family, social backwardness disappears. To allow these persons to take advantage of the privileges meant for backward persons, will result in depriving the real backward persons of their chance to make progress. In a number of cases,83 it has been held that a lady marrying a Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe/Other Backward Citizen (OBC), or one transplanted by adoption or any other voluntary act, does not ipso facto become entitled to claim reservation under either Art. 15(4) or Art. 16(4).84 In Valsamma Paul v. Cochin University, 85 the Supreme Court has explained the rationale behind this ruling as follows:86 \"It is seen that Dalits and Tribes suffered social and economic disabilities recognised by Articles 17 and 15(2). Consequently, they became socially, culturally and educationally backward; the OBC also suffered social and educational backwardness. The object of reservation is to remove these handicaps, disadvantages, sufferings and restrictions to which the members of the Dalits or Tribes or OBCs were subjected to and was sought to bring them in the mainstream of the nation's life by providing them opportunities and facilities... Therefore, when a member is transplanted into the Dalits, Tribes and OBCs, he/she must of necessity also undergo same handicaps, be subject to the same disabilities, disadvantages, indignities or sufferings so as to entitle the candidate to avail the facility of reservation\". The Court went on to say that a person who has had an advantageous start in life having been born in forward caste is transplanted into a backward caste by adoption / marriage / conversion does not become eligible to the benefit of reservation either under Art. 15(4) or 16(4). \"Acquisition of the status of SC, etc. by voluntary mobility into these categories would play fraud on the Constitution, and would frustrate the foreign constitutional policy under Arts. 15(4) and 16(4) of the Constitution.\" What happened in Valsamma was that a Syrian Catholic (a forward caste) lady married to a Latin Catholic was appointed as a lecturer as a reserved candidate. This was challenged and the Supreme Court ultimately quashed her appointment on the ground that she was not entitled to the benefit of reservation under Art. 16(4) as a lecturer as the post in question was reserved for the backward class Latin Catholic Community. The Supreme Court has clarified in Jagdish Negi v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 87 that no class of citizens can be perpetually treated as socially and educationally backward. Backwardness cannot continue indefinitely. Every citizen has a right to develop socially and educationally.",

The Supreme Court has clarified in Jagdish Negi v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 87 that no class of citizens can be perpetually treated as socially and educationally backward. Backwardness cannot continue indefinitely. Every citizen has a right to develop socially and educationally. The State is entitled to review the situation from time to time. There is no rule that once a \"backward class of citizens, always such a backward class\". Once a class of citizens has been held to be socially and educationally backward class of citizens, it cannot be predicated that in future it may not cease to be so. The State may review the situation from time to time and decide whether a given class of citizens which has been characterised as \"socially and educationally backward\" has continued to form part of that category or has ceased to fall in that category. The Supreme Court has observed in Indra Sawhney88 that the policy of reservation has to be operated year-wise and there cannot be any such policy in perpetuity. The State can review from year to year the eligibility of the class of socially and educationally backward class of citizens. Further, it has been held that Art. 15(4) does not mean that the percentage of reservation should be in proportion to the percentage of the population of the backward classes to the total population. It is in the discretion of the State to keep reservations at reasonable level by taking into consideration all legitimate claims and the relevant factors. (d) QUANTUM OF RESERVATION What is the extent of reservation that can be made under Art. 15(4)? Page 1051 The Supreme Court has set its face, generally speaking, against excessive reservation, for it is bound to affect efficiency and quality by eliminating general competition. For the first time, in Balaji,89 the question was raised before the Supreme Court relating to the extent of special provisions which the States can make under Art. 15(4). In this case, reservation up to 68% was made by the State of Mysore for backward classes for admission to the State medical and engineering colleges. The break-up of the reservation was as follows: 50% seats for backward and 'more' backward classes; 15% seats for Scheduled Castes; 3% seats for the Scheduled Tribes. In effect, 68% seats were reserved in medical, engineering and other technical colleges for the weaker sections of the society, leaving only 32% seats for the merit pool. The State even argued that since Art. 15(4) does not contain any limitation on the State's power to make reservation, cent percent reservation could be made in favour of backward classes in the higher educational institution if the problem of backwardness in a State so demanded. The Supreme Court rejected this extreme argument. The Court also rejected the rule of 68% reservation. The Court agreed, on the one hand, that Art. 15(4) must be read with Art. 46, a directive principle,90 and steps ought to be taken to redress backwardness and inequality from which the backward classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes suffer otherwise for them political freedom and Fundamental Rights would have little meaning. On the other hand, the Court insisted that Art. 15(4) being a special provision cannot denude Art. 15(1) of all its significance. Art. 15(4) \"is not a provision which is exclusive in character, so that in looking after the advancement of those classes, the State would be justified in ignoring altogether the advancement of the rest of the society.\" The Court observed: \"It is because the interests of the society at large would be served by promoting the advancement of the weaker elements in the society that Article 15(4) authorises special provision to be made. But if a provision which is in the nature of an exception completely excludes the rest of the society, that clearly is outside the scope of Article 15(4). It would be extremely unreasonable to assume that in enacting Article 15(4) Parliament intended to provide that where the advancement of the Backward Classes or the Scheduled Castes and Tribes was concerned, the fundamental rights of the citizens consisting of the rest of the society were to be completely ignored.\" The Court emphasized that a special provision contemplated by Art. 15(4) must be within reasonable limits. The interests of the weaker sections of society have to be adjusted with the interests of the community as a whole. The Court insisted that considerations of national interest and the interests of the community or society as a whole cannot be ignored in determining the reasonableness of a special provision under Art. 15(4). The Court observed on this point: \"The demand for technicians, scientists, doctors, economists, engineers and experts for the further economic advancement of the country is so great that it would cause grave prejudice to national interests if considerations of merit are completely excluded by wholesale reservation of seats in all technical, medical or engineering colleges or institutions of that kind\". Thus, the Supreme Court set its face against excessive reservation under Art. 15(4), for it may affect efficiency by eliminating general competition. The general principle laid down by the Court is that the maximum limit of reservation should not be more than 50% for all classes under Art. 15(4), viz., backward classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Thus, reservation of 68% was declared void in Balaji. The Court observed that the interests of the weaker sections of the society need to be adjusted with interests of the society as a whole.",

The Court observed that the interests of the weaker sections of the society need to be adjusted with interests of the society as a whole. In Balaji, the Supreme Court clearly indicated that in giving effect to reservations for SCs, STs and OBCs, a balance ought to be struck so that the interests of the backward classes, STs and SCs are properly balanced with the interests of the other segments of the society. In order to safeguard the interests of the reserved classes, the interests of the community as a whole cannot be ignored. It has to be remembered that Art. 15(4) is an enabling provision and its objective is to advance the interests of the weaker elements in society. Reservations under Art. 15(4) must be within a reasonable limit. If a provision under Art. 15(4) ignores the interests of the society as a whole, it would be clearly outside the purview of Art. 15(4). It may be noted that the over-all limit of 50% reservation is only for the categories mentioned in Art. 15(4); there could be Page 1052 additional reservation for other classes. For admission to the State medical colleges0, the Madhya Pradesh Government made the following reservation of seats: Scheduled Castes, 15%; Scheduled Tribes, 15%; Women candidates, 15%; Children of military personnel, 3%; Nominees of the Central Government, 3% and nominees of Jammu & Kashmir Government, 3%. The Scheme was challenged but the Supreme Court upheld it in State of Madhya Pradesh v. Nivedita Jain .91 D. RESERVATION IN ADMISSIONS The question of reservations has become a very knotty socio-politico issue of the day. Because of keen competition for limited opportunities available in the country, governments are pressurized to indulge in all kinds of reservations for all kinds of groups apart from reservations for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and backward classes. Basically, any reservation is discriminatory for reservation means that as between two candidates of equal merit, the candidate belonging to the reserve quota is preferred to the one having no reserve quota. Many deserving candidates thus feel frustrated because of reservation for the less deserving persons and they seek to challenge the scheme of reservation as unconstitutional. The relevant Articles are 14, 15 and 16. Under Art. 15, reservation in educational institutions can be made for: (1) Women under Art. 15(3); (2) Socially and educationally backward classes and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes under Art. 15(4); (3) Other groups not falling under Arts. 15(3) and 15(4). Questions arise frequently regarding reservation of seats for administration in educational institutions for categories of persons other than those falling under Arts. 15(3) and 15(4). This can be done under Art. 15(1) itself but the main question to consider is whether the classification is reasonable. The tests applied here are the same as are applicable in case of Art. 14 to adjudge whether the classification is reasonable.1 Thus, the 'equality' principle contained in Art. 15(1) is not infringed so long reservation is made for a class which can be identified on the basis of a rational, relevant and intelligible differentia, and there is nexus between the differentia and the object to be achieved, viz., to get the best talent for admission to professional colleges. As the Supreme Court has stated, the \"socially and educationally backward\" can be shown some preferential treatment because of Art. 15(4). The underlying idea is that in course of time, these persons will be able to stand in equal position with the more advanced sections of the society. The same principle may be applied to other handicapped sections which do not fall under Art. 15(4). Thus, reservation of seats for children of defence personnel, ex-defence personnel, political sufferers has been upheld.2 Constitution being a living organ, rights are to be determined in terms of judgments interpreting the Constitution. Right of a meritorious student to get admission in a postgraduate course is a fundamental and human right which is required to be protected. Such a valuable right cannot be permitted to be whittled down at the instance of less meritorious students.3 Fixation of a district-wise quota on the basis of the district population to the total State population for admission to the State medical colleges has been held to be discriminatory. The object in selecting candidates for admission is to get the best possible material for admission to colleges. Whether selection is from the socially and educationally backward classes or from the general pool, the object of selection must be to secure the best possible talent from the two sources. But this purpose cannot be achieved by allocation of seats district-wise as better qualified candidates from one district may be rejected while less qualified candidates from other districts may be admitted.4 As the object to be achieved is to get the best talent for admission to professional colleges, the allocation of seats district-wise has no reasonable relation with the object to be achieved. If anything, such allocation will result in the object being destroyed in many cases. As a sequel to the above pronouncement, the State Government introduced a new scheme of admissions to medical colleges. These colleges in the State were grouped into several units and an applicant could seek Page 1053 admission to a unit. This scheme was also held to be void as being violative of Art. 14 because the students in some of the units were in a better position than those who applied in other units, since the ratio between the applicants and the number of seats in each unit varied and several applicants who secured lesser marks than the petitioners were selected merely because their applications came to be considered in other units.",

Also, reservation for children of government servants posted abroad in Indian Missions has also been upheld because these persons face (because of exigencies of service) lot of difficulties in the matter of education.6 There could be reasonable classification based on intelligible differentia for purposes of Arts. 15(1) and 15(4). The Court said that since the government bears the financial burden of running the medical colleges it can decide the sources from where the students are to be admitted. \"If the sources are properly classified on territorial, geographical or other reasonable basis it is not for courts to interfere with the manner and method of making the classification.\" In the instant case, the Court ruled that there was no discrimination against the appellants on grounds only of religion, race, caste, language, sex or place of birth and the classification made by the Central Government was reasonable and based on intelligible differentia. Since SCs and STs form a separate class by themselves and outside the creamy layer area and having regard to Art.46, these socially backward categories are to be taken care of at every stage and even in specialized institutions like IITs. The argument of maintenance of high standards made on behalf of Delhi IIT was rejected although the Court accepted the position that 'the petitioners were not able to secure the required credits as against the stipulated minimum requirements for continuation' of their studies.7 This is close to Arun Shourie's 'Bending over Backwards' and discourages merit and excellence. For admission to the medical college in the State, 60 per cent seats were to be filled on merit, 20 per cent from Scheduled Castes and other reserved categories including socially and educationally backward classes and the remaining 20 per cent of the seats were earmarked for \"ensuring rectification of regional imbalances.\" In Nishi Meghu v. State of Jammu and Kashmir, 8 the classification made for \"rectification of regional imbalances\" was declared invalid as being too vague as areas suffering from imbalances had not been identified. Thereafter, the State Government identified certain villages as socially and educationally backward for applying the principle of \"rectification of regional imbalances\" in different parts of the State. The Supreme Court again held in Arti Sapru v. State of Jammu and Kashmir9 that the classification suffered from the vice of arbitrariness, because there was no intelligible data before the Court for sustaining the classification. The Court invoked the principle advocated in Pradip Tandon.10 The Nagpur University made some reservation for wards of the university employees for admission to the Institute of Technology. The reservation was sought to be justified on the ground of 'welfare of the employees'. The High Court held the scheme to be irrational. The High Court denied that such a ground could be a relevant basis for purposes of admission of students.11 Reservation of seats in medical colleges for sons and daughters of employees serving in the Health Department of the State was quashed as being arbitrary and irrational.12 Similarly, 5% seats reserved for admission to the B. Tech Course in the University in favour of the sons andwards of the University employees was quashed by the Supreme Court as being violative of Art. 14.13 The Court observed: \"The reservation of seats for admission to the B. Tech. Course in favour of the sons and wards of the employees of the University is violative of the doctrine of equality enshrined in Art. 14 of the Constitution. There is no rationale for the reservation of the seats in favour of the sons and wards of the employees of the University nor any such reservation has any rational nexus with the object which is sought to be achieved by the University\". It may be noted that such reservation falls under Art. 15(1) and not under Art. 15(4) and this can be valid only if it fulfils the tests of reasonable classification as laid down under Art. 14. The same principle has been applied in the case of an unaided technological institution affiliated to the University. The Court has ruled that such an institution has to abide by the University rules and the University Page 1054 is bound by Art. 14. Reservation of seats in the B. Tech course of the Institute in favour of the wards of the college staff does not satisfy the test of admission being given strictly on the basis of merit.14 The Court has taken the position that any preferential treatment has to be consistent with Art. 14 which permits reasonable classification. Such classification should have a reasonable nexus with the object of the rules providing for such admission, namely, to select the most meritorious amongst the candidates to have advantage of such education. For purposes of admission to the post-graduate courses in medicine, provision was made for weightage of 15 per cent marks on the basis of service in rural areas. The High Court ruled that while some weightage on this basis per se might not be discriminatory, the amount of weightage in question was excessive as a second class candidate could get precedence over a first class candidate. Also, reserving seats for medical officers who have been unsuccessful in post-graduate examination outside the State was held not justifiable as this amounted to putting a premium on incompetency.15 For admission to the medical course, a common entrance test was prescribed for candidates who had passed the pre-University course and the Higher Secondary course. The candidates were to be admitted on the basis of the results of the test. A reservation of 40 per cent of seats was made in favour of the H.S.C. candidates. The reservation was held discriminatory and arbitrary. There can be no valid classification after a common test has been prescribed.",

    "content": "candidates were to be admitted on the basis of the results of the test. A reservation of 40 per cent of seats was made in favour of the H.S.C. candidates. The reservation was held discriminatory and arbitrary. There can be no valid classification after a common test has been prescribed. Such a classification has no nexus to the object of selecting the best candidates for medical course.16 Two per cent seats were reserved in the Kerala University for candidates from other universities in the post-graduate course in medicine. The Supreme Court held in Charles K. Skaria v. Dr. C. Mathew, 17 that this paltry reservation for outside candidates was not sufficient and infringed Art. 14 and 15. These articles do not recognise State frontiers or 'the cult of the sons of the soil.' The necessary implication of these constitutional provisions is that every basic degree holder who fills the bill can apply for admission for post-graduate courses. The niggardly quota of 2 per cent of the total number of seats for candidates of the entire country minus Kerala did not represent \"a catholic approach informed by nationalist generosity\". It is not a sufficient fulfilment of Arts. 14 and 15. \"Fundamental rights of candidates do not depend on the grace of governments and Indians are not aliens in their own motherland when asking for seats on the score of equal opportunity.\" In Chanchala's case,18 university-wise allocation for admission in medical colleges in the State of Karnataka was held to be valid. The scheme was that students passing from colleges affiliated to one University were first admitted to government medical colleges affiliated to that University and only 20 per cent seats in each of such medical colleges could be allotted to outsiders. This was upheld on the ground that Universities were set up for satisfying the educational needs of different areas. The Supreme Court upheld University-wise distribution of seats, though it was not in conformity with the principle of section based on merit and marked a departure from this principle. The justification for taking this view was that constitutional preference was not constitutionally impermissible for two reasons. One, it would be quite legitimate for students attached to a University to desire to have training in specialised subjects, like medicine, in colleges affiliated to their own University as it would promote institutional continuity which has its own value. Two, any student from any part of the country can pass the qualifying examination of that University, irrespective of the place of his birth or residence. The scheme of University-wise allocation was then modified by adding the rider that the proportion of admissions should be fixed by the proportion of the number of students presented by the concerned Universities for the pre-degree and B.Sc. examinations. This was held to be bad. The Court could not see any nexus between the registered student-strength and the seats to be allotted. The result of the rider was to discriminate against the backward area where the pre-degree or degree students would be fewer. The fewer the colleges, the fewer the pre-degree or degree students and so the linkage of the division of seats with the registered student-strength would make an irrational inroad into the scheme of University-wise allocation. \"Such a formula would be a punishment for backwardness, not a promotion of their advancement.\"19 It is clear from this decision that the Court would accept some kind of reservation if it is designed to remove backwardness. Page 1055 Admissions to the LL.B. course of Punjab University were made on merit with the rider that 10% of the marks obtained in the qualifying examination were to be added in case of candidates from the Punjab University. Following Chanchala, the Supreme Court upheld the scheme. The Court ruled that \"university-wise preference is permissible provided it is relevant and reasonable.\" But the Court also ruled that 10% preference was on the higher side in this competitive age and such a preference ought not to increase 5%.20 The U.P. Government made reservation of seats in the State medical colleges in favour of two classes of candidates--(1) Those who came from hill areas and Uttrakhand; (2) Those who came from rural areas. The Supreme Court upheld reservations in favour of candidates from hill areas and Uttrakhand as it was satisfied that the people therein were socially and educationally backward, but reservation in favour of rural people was held unconstitutional. The rural population being 80 per cent of the entire State population, the Court found it incomprehensible as to how such a large population could be regarded as backward. Thus, the Court ruled that the reservation for rural areas as such could not be sustained on the ground that the rural population represented socially and educationally backward class of citizens. The Court held that rural element did not make it a class. The Court refused to accept the test of poverty as the 'determining factor of social backwardness'. Poverty is not the common trait of rural people alone; it is widespread in India, and to take poverty as the exclusive test would mean that a large population in India is held backward.21 Similarly, in Janki Prasad,22 the Court did not approve declaration of 'small cultivators' and 'low paid pensioners' as backward for this is to form artificial groups to confer certain benefits under the Constitution, and is to place economic considerations above other considerations which go to show whether a particular class is socially and educationally backward. Mere poverty cannot be a test of backwardness because in this country except for a small percentage of the population, the people are generally poor--some being more poor, others less poor. The Court also held that each of the factors, traditional occupations or residents of certain inaccessible areas, can be applied by itself, to list backward classes.",

    "content": "poverty cannot be a test of backwardness because in this country except for a small percentage of the population, the people are generally poor--some being more poor, others less poor. The Court also held that each of the factors, traditional occupations or residents of certain inaccessible areas, can be applied by itself, to list backward classes. The Court ruled that residents of certain areas may remain in primitive conditions because of lack of communication, inaccessibility, lack of resources etc., and residents of such areas may be validly treated as socially and educationally backward. A government order laying down a list of socially and educationally backward classes but exempting therefrom the families having an aggregate income of Rs. 6,000 annually or more is valid. Poverty is a relevant factor to determine social and educational backwardness, but it cannot be an exclusive or dominant factor.23 The Supreme Court has emphasized that the primary consideration for selecting candidates for admission to medical colleges is merit. But departure from the merit principle is permissible where it is necessary to do so for the purpose of bringing about real equality of opportunity between those who are unequals. Merit principle may thus be departed from either in State interest,24 or on the consideration of a region's claim for backwardness.25 While 'residence' may be the basis of reservation, according to the Supreme Court in Pradeep Jain v. Union of India, 26 it may be tested on the touch stone of Art. 14. Accordingly, the Court has condemned as unconstitutional and void under Art. 14 \"wholesale reservation\" on the basis, of the 'domicile' or 'residence' requirement within the State,27 or on the basis of 'institutional' preference for students passing the qualifying examination for admission so as to exclude all students not satisfying the requirement regardless of merit. The Court pointed out that the principle of selection can be diluted on the ground of regional backwardness. If the State Government starts a medical college in a backward region, and reserves most of the seats therein to the students from the region, then such reservation or preferential treatment cannot be regarded as discriminatory. Students from backward region can hardly compete with the students from advanced region. Reservation or preference in such a case may be of a high percentage but it cannot be total. The Court however accepted reservation up to 70% of the total number of open seats (after deducting other kinds of reservations validly made) for admission to the M.B.B.S. Course on the ground of 'residence'. The Court accepted this outer limit in order to reconcile the \"apparently conflicting claims of equality and Page 1056 excellence\". But the 30% of all seats should remain open and available for admission to students on an All-India basis irrespective of the State or University from which they come. As regards the 30% unreserved seats in the M.B.B.S. Course, the Supreme Court has ruled in Dinesh Kumar v. Motilal Nehru Medical College, 28 that these seats must not be filled on the basis of comparison of the marks obtained by the candidates at different qualifying examinations because the standard of judging may vary and may not be uniform. \"That would indeed be blatantly violative of the concept of equality enshrined in Art. 14.\" Admissions must be based on evaluation of relative merits through an entrance examination open to all candidates throughout the country. The Court has suggested that a common All-India Entrance examination be held by the Indian Medical Council for the purpose. In Dinesh II29, the Supreme Court has revised the formula laid down in Dinesh I. The Court has now fixed a quota of 15% of the total number of seats in a medical college without taking into account any reservation to be filled through an All-India Entrance Examination. The defect in the old formula was that a State could reduce the number of All-India seats by the simple expedient of increasing the number of reserved seats. The Court has also decided that the medium of the All-India Entrance Examination would be English and no regional language and that the examination would be conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Examination instead of the Medical Council of India which does not have the necessary infrastructure for the purpose of conducting an examination. In Ravinder Kumar Rai v. State of Maharashtra, 30 the Supreme Court has rejected the contention of the State that conducting entrance examination would delay the admission process. The Ahmedabad Municipality started a medical college and reserved admission therein to 'local students to the MBBS Course. However, 15% of the seats were reserved for students on an All-India basis. In Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation v. Nilaybhai R. Thakore, 31 the Supreme Court held the rule to be valid. The Court pointed out that the Municipality has started the college out of municipal funds. \"Its desire to provide as many seats as possible to its students is a natural and genuine desire emanating from its municipal obligations which deserves to be upheld to the extent possible.\" The object of the municipality, the Court said, was laudable. The Court also pointed out that the municipality has complied with its constitutional obligation by providing 15% of the seats available to All-India students.32 The term \"local student\" has been interpreted by the Court to mean any permanent resident student of Ahmedabad city who has acquired his qualification from an institution situated within the Ahmedabad Urban Development Area. So far as the undergraduate courses are concerned, the reservations based on domicile, University or Institution are permissible provided that the said reservations are not wholesale.33 As regards admission to the post-graduate and super-speciality courses, no reservations are possible.34 In Nidmarti Maheshkumar v. State of Maharashtra, 35 for purposes of admission to the MBBS Course, region-wise classification was made in the State.",

    "content": "rule said that the students passing the XII standard examination from institutions within the jurisdiction of one University would claim admission only in the medical colleges in that region and would not be eligible for admission to medical colleges situated within the jurisdiction of another University in the State. This region-wise classification made by the State government was challenged under Art. 14. The Court ruled that Art. 14 is violated if a State is compartmentalized into different regions and mobility of students from one region to another for medical education is completely banned and, thus, they are denied equal opportunity with others in the State for medical education. This cannot be defended even on the ground of regional backwardness. Why should a brilliant student from a so-called backward region be denied admission in a medical college in an advanced region? Why should mobility for educational advancement be impeded by geographical limitations within the State especially when uniform educational standards are being maintained throughout the State, when a common examination is held by the Secondary Board, students are graded uniformly throughout the State, and only results are published and merit list prepared region-wise? The Court characterised it as discriminatory that a student with lesser marks may be admitted in one region while a student with higher marks may be denied admission in another region. Also, a student in one region could not get admission in another region even though students with lesser marks than him have been Page 1057 admitted there. The Court distinguished the instant case from Chanchal on two grounds: (1) In Chanchal, there was no common or uniform examination, while here there was one examination throughout the State; (2) In Chanchal, 20% seats were allowed for students from other regions, while in the instant case there was 100% regional reservation. However, the Court reiterated its earlier view that region-wise reservation upto 70% of the total number of open seats in a medical college after taking into account other kinds of reservations could be made for students who had studied in institutions situated within that region. This could be justified for two reasons: (1) many students are not able to avail of medical education away from their region, as because of lack of resources, they cannot study far away from their places of residence, and may, thus, be deprived of medical education; (2) girl students may find it difficult to pursue medical education in another region beyond their places of residence. But such reservation based on residence requirement or institutional preference should not exceed 70% of the total number of open seats after taking into account all other kinds of reservations validly made. The remaining 30% of the open seats at least should be made available for admission to students from other regions within the State. The Court clarified that the expression \"total number of open seats\", means the seats after deducting the seats required to be made available on an All-India basis as decided by the Court in Dr. Pradeep Jain's case. In Jagdish Saran36 and Pradeep Jain,37 the Supreme Court has already upheld residential or institutional preference for admission to medical colleges. Following these cases, in Anant Madan,38 the Supreme Court has ruled that the condition that a candidate should have studied in 10th, 10+1 and 10+2 classes in a recognised institution in the State for admission to the medical college is valid. This eligibility criterion is in conformity with the rulings in Jagdish Saran and Pradeep Jain and is not arbitrary or unreasonable or violative of Art. 14. On the whole, the impact of judicial pronouncements in the area has been wholesome. The growing tendency to make reservations in technical institutions for all and sundry has been curbed to some extent. In the absence of Judicial control, reservation would have run riot, excluding all merit. Had this tendency not been controlled, it would have led to the inevitable result of falling standards which would have been a national loss. Many deserving and better qualified candidates from the so called advanced sections of society would have been forced to go without education and this would have been unjust to them. The Supreme Court's pronouncements put the whole problem posed by Art. 15(4) within a reasonable mould. It was also necessary to play down the importance of caste lest the caste system instead of being obliterated should be perpetuated.39 A very important achievement of the Court is that 15% seats in medical colleges are to be filled in on an All India basis. To this extent, the Court has overruled its earlier decision in Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research Chandigarh v. K.L. Narasimham.40 However, at the next below stage of post-graduate level, there could be some nominal reservation, but the question has not been finally decided in Preeti Sagar. (a) POST GRADUATE COURSES While the Supreme Court has shown some flexibility of approach in the matter of fixation of criteria/reservation/preference for admission to graduate courses like M.B.B.S., as discussed above, it has adopted somewhat stringent approach towards admissions to post-graduate courses and still more stringent attitude to admissions to super-specialities. The basic proposition laid down by the Supreme Court is that admission to post-graduate courses should be based strictly on merit and that there should be no dilution of standards in such courses.41 This judicial approach is illustrated by the following judicial pronouncements. In a number of cases, the Supreme Court has expressed doubt whether there can be any reservation at the post-graduate level for backward classes. For example, in a post-graduate medical course, only M.B.B.S. Page 1058 candidates can be admitted. Can an M.B.B.S. be regarded as backward even though he may belong to a backward class. Reservation in the higher courses would perpetuate the pernicious theory \"once backward always backward.\" The Court has advocated the principle that the higher you go in the ladder of education, the lesser should be the reservation.",

Reservation in the higher courses would perpetuate the pernicious theory \"once backward always backward.\" The Court has advocated the principle that the higher you go in the ladder of education, the lesser should be the reservation. Generally speaking, at the post-graduate level, it is merit that ought to count. Thus, the Supreme Court has observed in Jagdish Saran,42 that to encourage SC/ST/OBC students, the State may reserve seats for them at the under graduate level, but at the level of Ph.D., M.D., or levels of higher proficiency, \"equality\", measured by matching excellence, has more meaning and cannot be diluted much without grave risk.\" At the highest scales of proficiency or speciality, \"the best skill or talent, must be hand-picked by selecting according to capability.\" At that level, \"where international measure of talent is made, where losing one great scientist or technologist-in-the making is a national loss, the considerations we have expanded upon as important lose their potency.\" In Pradeep Jain,43 the Supreme Court expressed great reluctance in accepting any reservation for admissions to post graduate courses where ordinarily merit should prevail. The case dealt with reservation of seats for the residents of the State or the students of the same University for admission to the medical colleges.44 The Court said in the instant case, that considerations for admission to the post-graduate courses such as M.D. and the like for reservation based residence requirements within the State or institutional preference were different from those for admission to the M.B.B.S. course. The Court emphatically stated that excellence cannot be allowed to be compromised by any other considerations because that would be detrimental to national interests. The Court thus opined that in case of admissions to the post-graduate courses, such as M.S., M.D. and the like, \"it would be eminently desirable not to provide for any reservation based on residence requirement within the State or on institutional preference. The Court observed further: \"This proposition has greater importance when we reach the higher levels of education like Post-Graduate Courses. After all, top technological expertise in any vital field like medicine is a nation's human asset without which its advance and development will be stunted. The role of high grade skill or special talent may be less at the lesser levels of education, jobs and disciplines of social consequence, but more at the higher levels of sophisticated skills and strategic employment. To devalue merit at the summit is to temporise with the country's development in the vital areas of professional expertise.\" However, the Court directed in Pradeep Jain that while residence within the State would not be a ground for reservation in admissions to post-graduate courses, a certain percentage of the seats could be reserved on the basis of 'institutional preference' in the sense that a student who has passed the MBBS course from a medical college or University, may be given preference for admission to the post-graduate course in the same medical college or University. But such reservation on the basis of institutional preference should not in any event exceed 50% of the total number of open seats available for admission to the post-graduate course. But the Court directed that even in regard to admissions to the post-graduate course, so far as super-specialities such as neurosurgery and cardiology are concerned, there should be no reservation at all even on the basis of institutional preference and admissions should be granted purely on merit on an all India basis.45 The Court observed further that admission to the non-reserved seats for post-graduate courses such as M.S., M.D. and the like cannot be made on the basis of marks obtained by the students at different MBBS examinations held by different universities since there will be no comparable standard by reference to which the relative merits of the students seeking admission to post-graduate courses can be judged. In order to meet the demands of the equality clause, admissions to 50% non-reserved seats in the post-graduate courses must be made on the basis of comparative evaluation of merits of the students through an entrance examination. The Court preferred such an examination being held by the Indian Medical Council on all India basis. But if this was not possible for some reason, then such an examination could be held by the State Government or the University for the medical colleges situated within the State or affiliated to the University. Again, the Supreme Court has observed in the following case46 that \"with regard to post-graduate and super-specialities, this Court has prohibited any reservation whatsoever\". Page 1059 But, the Supreme Court has now changed its stance on this question and has ruled that there may be reservation of seats for backward classes in admission to post-graduate, speciality or super-speciality courses in medicine. The Court has argued that after admission, every student has to undergo the same courses and the same examination even though at the admission stage the cut-off point may be lower for backward candidates than for general candidates.47 In Dinesh Kumar I,48 the Supreme Court has insisted that admission to the open seats in post-graduate medical courses (viz. 50%) ought to be made on the basis of the marks obtained in an all India examination and not on the basis of the marks obtained by the candidates at various qualifying examinations held by various bodies where the standard of judging may not be uniform. Some Universities may be very liberal in their marking while others may be strict. There would thus be no comparable standard on the basis of which the relative merits of the students may be judged and that \"would indeed be blatantly violative of the concept of equality enshrined in Art. 14 of the Constitution.\" The Court directed the Indian Medical Council to prepare a scheme for holding the qualifying examination.",

In Dinesh Kumar II,49 the Supreme Court reconsidered some of the matters decided by it in Dinesh Kumar I and issued some fresh and modified directions as regards admissions to Post-Graduate Medical Courses. One, the medium of the all India examination to be conducted for admission for these courses shall be English. Two, instead of making available 50% of the open seats after taking into account reservations validly made, 25% of the total number of seats without taking into account any reservations should be made available for being filled on the basis of an all India entrance examination. The reason behind the new formula was that a State could, under the old formula, reduce the number of the open seats by increasing reservations on various grounds. The new formula frees the open seats from any reservations which may be made by a State. Three, the entrance examination would be conducted by the All India Medical Science Institute instead of the Medical Council of India which does not have the necessary infrastructure for the purpose. In Dinesh II, the Supreme Court also rejected the suggestion that a weightage of 15% of the total marks obtained by a candidate of the All India Entrance Examination for admission to the Post-Graduate Course to the doctors who had put in a minimum of three years of rural service. The Court insisted that selection of candidates for admission to Post- Graduate medical course should be based on merits and no factor other than merit should be allowed to tilt the balance in favour of a candidate. The University of Rajasthan issued an ordinance providing for the addition of 5% marks to the total marks obtained by a student at the entrance examination by way of college-wise institutional preference which meant that these marks were to be added to the marks obtained by a student applying for admission to the post-graduate course in any of the five medical colleges in the State, provided the student had passed his MBBS course from the same college to which admission was sought in the post-graduate course. In State of Rajasthan v. Dr. Ashok Kumar Gupta, 50 the Supreme Court disapproved the college-wise institutional preference as violative of Art. 14. A rule provided for college-wise institutional preference for admission to post-graduate courses in Medical Science being run in the medical colleges of the State and the Municipal Corporation. The rule meant that the students of each particular college passing their MBBS examination from that college would exclude all other students obtaining their MBBS degree from the other colleges. The Supreme Court declared the rule invalid inGreater Bombay Municipal Corp. v. Thukral Anjali Deokumar .51 The Court ruled that there was no place for college-wise reservation. The Court was in favour of removing institutional preference and pooling together all the candidates from the University. Because of the impugned rule, many meritorious students could not get admission even if they secured higher marks than those admitted in the post-graduate degree course. There arose a patent discrimination in as much as students obtaining lesser marks were preferred to those obtaining higher marks. There was no intelligible differentia for the classification by way of college-wise institutional preference. \"So far as educational institutions are concerned, unless there are strong reasons for exclusion of meritorious candidates, any preference other than in order of merit, will not stand the test of Article 14 of the Constitution. So, the impugned rules are discriminatory and do not satisfy the tests of reasonable classification and, as such, cannot be sustained.\" Another instance of institutional preference came before the Supreme Court in Goel.52 The State of Uttar Pradesh has seven medical colleges offering post-graduate medical courses. A combined entrance Page 1060 examination was held for admission to these courses and the results of the examination were announced so as to provide for a separate merit list for each college out of the institutional students of that college and seats in each college filled on the basis of the separate merit list. An 'institutional student' meant a student obtaining MBBS degree of that institution. This was challenged. The Supreme Court declared the issuing of separate merit list for each college invalid under Art. 14 as the classification on the basis of college-wise institutional preference was held to be discriminatory and arbitrary. \"There cannot be any vested right in seeking admission in a particular college. Merit as the basis for selection in the speciality in a post-graduate degree course in one college cannot be sacrificed against convenience.\" If the rule of merit on the basis of institutional preference were applied, \"a candidate having secured a very high position in merit in the combined merit list for the whole State of Uttar Pradesh may be deprived of getting a speciality of his choice even though he might be prepared to go in another medical college in the same State of Uttar Pradesh.\" Reservation of 70% of seats by the Delhi University for admission to the post-graduate course in Dermatology for Delhi University graduates was frowned upon by the Supreme Court in Jagdish Saran v. Union of India .53 In the instant case, a medical graduate from Madras University was seeking admission to post-graduate degree course in the Delhi University as his father had been transferred to Delhi. Though he qualified in the entrance examination, yet he was denied admission because of the rule reserving 70% of the seats at the post-graduate level to Delhi University graduates. He challenged the validity of the rule. The Supreme Court emphasized that the primary imperative of Arts. 14 and 15 is equal opportunity for all across the nation to attain excellence.",

    "content": "he qualified in the entrance examination, yet he was denied admission because of the rule reserving 70% of the seats at the post-graduate level to Delhi University graduates. He challenged the validity of the rule. The Supreme Court emphasized that the primary imperative of Arts. 14 and 15 is equal opportunity for all across the nation to attain excellence. The philosophy and pragmatism of excellence through universal equal opportunity is part of the Indian culture and constitutional creed. This norm of non-discrimination, however, admits of just exceptions geared to equality, and does not forbid such basic measures as are needed to abolish the gaping realities of current inequalities afflicting 'socially and educationally backward classes' and 'the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes'. But reservation by a university for its own graduates creates a new kind of discrimination which is not sanctioned by Arts. 14 and 15. Delhi University students do not form an educationally backward class. But the Court also emphasized that at the post-graduate level \"equality, measured by matching excellence, has more meaning and cannot be diluted much without grave risk.\" Further, \"it is difficult to denounce or renounce the merit criterion when the selection is for post-graduate or post-doctoral courses in specialized subjects.... To sympathize mawkishly with the weaker sections by selecting sub-standard candidates, is to punish society as a whole by denying the prospect of excellence say in hospital service...So it is that relaxation on merit, by overruling equality and quality altogether, is a social risk where the stage is post-graduate or post-doctoral\".54 It may be pointed out that this reservation could not be justified under Art. 15(4) as the students of the Delhi University could not be regarded as educationally backward. Institution-wise reservation has no place in the scheme of Art. 15, although social and educational destitution may be endemic in some parts of the country where a college or university may be started to remedy this glaring imbalance and reservation for those alumni for higher studies may be permitted. Thus, reservation is to be linked to backwardness. However, the Court stressed that reservation should not run riot otherwise that will bring about a fall in medical competence. The very best should not be rejected from admission because that will be a national loss. The Court consequently laid down the following principles for this purpose: (i) reservation must be kept in check by the demands of competence. a certain percentage must be available for meritorious students. shelter of reservation should not be extended where minimum qualifications are absent. (ii) reservation on the ground of backwardness cannot prevail in the same measure at the highest scale of speciality where the best skill or talent must be picked up. Chanchala's case55 was now explained by the Court as follows: \"...University-wise preferential treatment may still be consistent with the rule of equality of opportunity where it is calculated to correct an imbalance or handicap and permit equality in the larger sense.\" The Court pointed out that advantaged groups are exploiting the propositions applicable to disabled categories. The Court thus stated:56 Page 1061 \"If university-wise classification for post-graduate medical education is shown to be relevant and reasonable and the differentia has a nexus to the larger goal of equalisation of educational opportunities the vice of discrimination may not invalidate the rule.\" Excessive reservation is an obvious inequality. The basis of classified quota can be promotion of better opportunities to the deprived categories of students or better supply of medical service to neglected regions of the country. The Delhi University reservation did not fit into these criteria as Delhi is in no sense an educationally or economically backward human region. Merit as a criteria should not be renounced for selection to post-graduate or post-doctoral courses in specialised subjects, but the court thought that some reservation for Delhi graduates may be justified for the following reasons: (i) Delhi students belong to families which are drawn from all over India. This is not based on the 'sons of the soil' doctrine. This reservation is, therefore, qualitatively different. (ii) Other Universities shut their doors on Delhi students. (iii) There ought to be institutional continuity. The Court did not specifically veto 70% reservation rule in this case as there was not sufficient data before the Court to decide the issue. But the Court any way directed that the petitioner be admitted. The Gujarat University made a rule giving preference to its own students over those from other Universities in admission to super-speciality medical course. The rule in question ran as follows: \"The first preference is to be given to the candidates from Gujarat University. Second preference to be given to students from other Universities in Gujarat. Any vacancy remaining after this shall remain unfilled.\" In Gujarat University v. Rajiv Gopinath Bhatt, 57 the Supreme Court upheld the rule with the following remarks: \"If a rule has been framed that out of the merit list prepared, preference is to be given for admission in the super speciality course to the students of the University in question per se it cannot be held to be arbitrary, unreasonable or violative of Art. 14.\" The ruling seems to be debatable in view of what the Court had observed earlier in Pradeep Jain. The last clause in the rule that the \"vacancy shall remain unfilled\" was, of course, vetoed by the Court. In Mohan Bir Singh Chawla v. Punjab University, 58 the Supreme Court said that at higher levels of education it would be dangerous to depreciate merit and excellence.",

    "content": "court thus declared: \"The higher you go in any discipline, lesser should be the reservations--of whatever kind.\" In Narayan Sharma v. Pankaj Kumar Lehkar, 59 the Supreme Court considered the validity of the following scheme of reservation made by the Assam Government for seats in the post-graduate medical courses in its medical colleges: (i) 25% All India quota; (ii) 4 seats for North Eastern Council; (iii) 6 seats for teachers in medical colleges, (iv) 20 seats for doctors who had worked for five years in a health centre outside the municipal limits; (v) 7% for Scheduled Caste candidates and (vi) 15% OBC candidates. An entrance examination was to be conducted but candidates in categories (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) were not required to appear at such an examination. The Supreme Court upheld reservation for category (ii) as these seats were meant for the five Eastern States having no medical college of their own. The students of these States being handicapped in getting medical education formed a separate class and reserving a few seats for them did not violate Art. 14. But the provision exempting them from appearing at an entrance examination was quashed as selection ought to be based on merit and could not be left to the arbitrary discretion of any administrative body. Reservation for category (iii) was also upheld. It was mandatory for teachers in medical colleges to have a Page 1062 postgraduate degree for their future promotions. They thus formed a separate elan by themselves and the classification was based on an intelligible differentia having rational nexus to the object of the rule. The teachers being constantly in touch with medical subjects could be validly exempted from the entrance examination. Reservation for category (iv) was quashed as per the reasoning in State of U.P. v. Pradip Tandon60 and Dinesh II,61 rural element could not be the basis of any classification. There was absolutely no controversy as regards category (i) which was in pursuance of several earlier pronouncements of the Supreme Court.62 In a recent case, A.I.I.M.S. Students' Union v. A.I.I.M.S.,63 the Supreme Court has given its powerful support to the test of merit over that of reservation for admission to post-graduate medical courses. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences situated at Delhi is a premier medical institution in India. It runs several post graduate courses. For admission to these courses, the Institute holds an All India Entrance Examination. The Institute followed a rule of reserving 40% seats in these courses for its medical graduates irrespective of their performance in the entrance examination. This resulted in internal students with low marks at the entrance examination being admitted at the cost of other students with higher marks. Accordingly, the rule was challenged and the Supreme Court quashed it. The Court permitted 25% reservation for Institute graduate with the rider that a uniform minimum cut-off of 50% marks at the competitive entrance examination be followed for all students and that the margin of difference between the qualifying marks for Institute's candidates and the general category candidates should not be too wide. The Court ruled : \"Such a reservation based on institutional continuity in the absence of any relevant evidence in justification thereof is unconstitutional and violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution and has therefore to be struck down\".64 The Court also pointed out that institutional reservation is not supported by the Constitution or constitutional principles. \"A certain degree of preference for students of the same institution intending to prosecute further studies therein is permissible on grounds of convenience, suitability and familiarity with an educational environment. Such preference has to be reasonable and not excessive... Minimum standards cannot be so diluted as to become practically non-existent.\"65 (b) PREETI SRIVASTAVA The Supreme Court has rendered a momentous decision in Dr. Preeti Sagar Srivastva v. State of Madhya Pradesh .66 The factual context in which this case arose was as follows: For admission to post-graduate degree/diploma courses in medicine, candidates were required to appear at an entrance examination. The State Government fixed a cut-off percentage of 45% marks in this examination for admission of the general category students while no cut off percentage of marks was fixed for SC/ST candidates. This meant that there was no minimum qualifying marks in the entrance examination prescribed for the reserved category candidates for admission to the post- graduate medical courses. This was challenged and the Supreme Court quashed the same in Dr. Sadhna Devi v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 67 with the remark that if this was done, merit would be sacrificed altogether. The Supreme Court was of the opinion that even for the reserved category candidates, there should be some minimum qualifying marks if not the same as prescribed as bench marks for general category students. Thus, there cannot be zero qualifying marks for reserved category candidates in the entrance test for admission to the post-graduate courses. The government having installed the system of holding an admission test, would not be entitled to do away with the requirement of obtaining minimum qualifying marks for the special category candidates. The government cannot say that even if these candidates have not obtained even the minimum qualifying marks they must still be selected for post-graduate courses. This amounts to rendering the admission test an idle formality because these candidates would qualify for admission even though they did not secure any marks. This thus amounts to sacrificing merit altogether. This Page 1063 could not be done. Therefore, if these students fail to secure the minimum qualifying marks, then the seats reserved for them should not go waste but should be released for the candidates of the general category. Otherwise there would be a national loss.68 In sum, in Sadhna, the Supreme Court insisted that for admission to post-graduate medical course, there ought to be prescribed a minimum cut off percentage of marks at the entrance examination for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other Backward Classes.",

    "content": "if these students fail to secure the minimum qualifying marks, then the seats reserved for them should not go waste but should be released for the candidates of the general category. Otherwise there would be a national loss.68 In sum, in Sadhna, the Supreme Court insisted that for admission to post-graduate medical course, there ought to be prescribed a minimum cut off percentage of marks at the entrance examination for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other Backward Classes. It would be unconstitutional as being violative of the right to equality to keep this cut off point at zero percent. As a sequel to the Sadhna ruling, the State of Uttar Pradesh prescribed a Post-Graduate Medical Entrance Examination for admission to Post-Graduate Degree/Diploma Course in medicine and fixed a cut-off percentage of 45 at the entrance examination for the general category candidates for admission to the post-graduate medical course. But for admission of reserved category candidates, the cut-off percentage was fixed at 20%. In addition, 50% of the seats in the post-graduate course were reserved for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled tribes and Backward classes candidates. A similar scheme was laid down in Madhya Pradesh. The Supreme Court was called upon to adjudge the validity of these schemes vis-à-vis Art. 15(4). However, in Preeti Sagar the Supreme Court did not express any opinion on the question whether reservation of seats is permissible at the post-graduate level in medicine as this question was not debated before it. The Court only examined the question whether lower qualifying marks could be prescribed for admission of reserved category candidates. The Court has pointed out in Preeti Sagar that Arts. 15(3) and 15(4) permit compensatory or protective discrimination in favour of certain classes. Every policy pursued under Article 15(4) makes a departure from the equality norm for the benefit of the backward. Therefore, it has to be designed and worked in a manner conducive to the ultimate building up of an egalitarian non-discriminatory society. That is its final constitutional justification. Therefore, programmes and policies of compensatory discrimination under Art. 15(4) have to be designed and pursued to achieve this ultimate national interest. At the same time, these programmes cannot be unreasonable or arbitrary, nor can they be executed in a manner which undermines other vital public interests or the general good of all. \"All public policies, therefore, in this area have to be tested on the anvil of reasonableness and ultimate public good.... Art. 15(4) also must be used, and policies under it framed, in a reasonable manner consistently with the ultimate public interests.\"69 The Court has emphasized: \"Consideration of national interest and the interests of the community or society as a whole cannot be ignored in determining the reasonableness of a special provision under Article 15(4).\"70 Any special provision under Art. 15(4) has to balance the importance of having, at the higher levels of education, students who are meritorious and who have secured admission on their merit, as against the social equity of giving compensatory benefit of admissions to the SC/ST candidates who are in a disadvantaged position. Selection of the right calibre of students is essential in the public interest at the level of specialised post-graduate education. Special provisions for SC/ST candidates at the speciality level have to be minimal. In the interest of selecting suitable candidates for specialised education, it is necessary that the common entrance examination be of a standard and qualifying marks are prescribed for passing that examination. Accordingly, the Supreme Court has refused to accept the argument that there need not be any qualifying marks prescribed for the qualifying examination for admission to the post-graduate medical courses as the candidates have already passed the M.B.B.S. examination which is the essential pre-requisite to post-graduate medical courses. The Court has ruled that even if minimum qualifying marks can be lower for the reserved categories candidates, there cannot be a wide disparity between the minimum qualifying marks for the reserved category candidates as against the general category candidates at the post-graduate level. This disparity must be minimal. The Court has held that the disparity between 20% marks for the reserved category and 45% marks for the general category is too great a disparity \"to sustain the public interest at the level of post-graduate medical training and education\". This is contrary to the mandate of Art. 15(4). Page 1064 The Court has not itself laid down how much relaxation can be given to the reserved category candidates in the matter of minimum qualifying marks as compared to the general candidates. The Court has left the matter for decision to the Medical Council of India \"since it affects standards of post-graduate medical education.\"71 An argument was advanced before the Court that if the threshold requirement for admission of SC/ST candidates was high then the seats allotted to them in medical colleges would not be filled up. The Court rejecting the argument maintained that the purpose of higher education is not to just fill seats by lowering standards. The purpose is to impart education to the SC/ST candidates and to enable them to rise to the standards which are expected of persons having the post-graduate medical qualification. While Art. 15(4) provides for protective discrimination in favour of the weaker sections, one cannot also ignore the wider interests of society while devising special provisions for them. A large differentiation of the qualifying marks between the two groups of students would make it very difficult to maintain the requisite standard of teaching and training at the post-graduate level. The Court has also ruled in Preeti Sagar that at the level of super-specialization, there cannot be any special provision as it is contrary to national interest. Merit alone can be the basis of selection.",

    "content": "Court has also ruled in Preeti Sagar that at the level of super-specialization, there cannot be any special provision as it is contrary to national interest. Merit alone can be the basis of selection. This means that no reservation can be made in the super-speciality courses in favour of the reserved classes because any dilution of merit at this stage would adversely affect the national goal of having the best possible candidates at the highest levels of professional and educational training. \"Opportunities for such training are few and it is in the national interest that these are made available to those who can profit from them, viz; the best brains in the country, irrespective of the class to which they belong.\"72 To this extent, the Court has overruled its earlier decision in Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh v. K.L. Narasimham . However, at the next lower stage of post-graduate level, there could be some nominal reservation, but the question has not been finally decided in Preeti Sagar. So far as admission to the M.B.B.S. Course is concerned, at one stage, the Court did agree that while in the entrance examination for admission to the M.B.B.S. course, a cut off point is fixed as regards the minimum marks which a general candidate must obtain to get admission, there need be no such limit for the reserve categories candidates. For example, in State of Madhya Pradesh v. Nivedita Jain, 73 an order issued by the M.P. Government dispensing with the requirement of obtaining any minimum qualifying marks in the pre-medical entrance examination for admission to the M.B.B.S. course for SC/ST candidates has been held valid. The order was passed because of the paucity of qualified SC/ST candidates. The factual context in which the order was passed was as follows: The State reserved 15% seats each for SC and ST candidates for admission to the M.B.B.S. course. This meant 108 seats each for the two groups out of a total of 720 seats. When the result of the Pre-Medical entrance examination was published, only 18 SC candidates and 2 ST candidates qualified. In view of the large unfilled quota of SC/ST candidates, the State completely relaxed the condition relating to the minimum qualifying marks for these two categories. Upholding the relaxation, the Court argued that the relaxation in the admission qualification would not effect any relaxation in the standard of medical education or curriculum of studies in medical colleges for those candidates after their admission to the college, and the standard of examination and the curriculum would remain the same for all students. But now the Supreme Court has changed its opinion as appears from Preeti Sagar. The Court has specifically disagreed with the view expressed by it in several earlier cases that the process of selection of candidates for admission to medical colleges has no real impact on the standard of medical education.74 The Court has observed in Preeti Sagar: \"...the criteria for the selection of candidates have an important bearing on the standard of education which can be effectively imparted in the medical colleges. We cannot agree with the proposition that prescribing no minimum qualifying marks for admission for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes would not have an impact on the standard of education in the medical colleges.\" The Court has now disagreed with the view expressed in earlier cases that since all students pass the same examination, standards of education are maintained and it does not matter even if students of lower merit are admitted.75 Page 1065 This approach of the Supreme Courtis most welcome as it is a very important step towards maintenance of a semblance of standard in medical education. Weak students are bound to pull down the level of teaching as the teacher has to tone down his teaching to the level of weak students in the class. If the teacher talks at a higher level then it will pass over the heads of weak students. Accordingly, the better students will be the sufferer as the weaker students always act as a drag on the entire class. 1. For comments on Art. 29, see, infra, Ch. XXX, Sec. A. 2. A.P.

M P Jain Indian Constitutional Law/Volume 1/PART V POLITICAL AND CIVIL RIGHTS/CHAPTER XXIII FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS (4) RIGHT TO EQUALITY (iii) CHAPTER XXIII Fundamental Rights (4) Right to Equality (iii) A. EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY IN PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT Article 16(1) is a facet of Art. 14. Arts. 14 and 16(1) are closely inter-connected. Art. 16(1) takes its roots from Art. 14. Art. 16(1) particularizes the generality of Art. 14 and identifies, in a constitutional sense, \"equality of opportunity\" in matters of employment under the state. An important point of distinction between Arts. 14 and 16 is that while Art. 14 applies to all persons, citizens as well as non-citizens, Art. 16 applies only to citizens and not to non-citizens. Article 16(1) guarantees equality of opportunity to all citizens \"in matters relating to employment\" or Page 1071 \"appointment to any office\" under the state. According to Art. 16(2), no citizen can be discriminated against, or be ineligible for any employment or office under the state, on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth or residence or any of them. Adherence to the rule of equality in public employment is a being feature of our constitution and the rule of law is its core, the Court cannot disable itself from making an order inconsistent with Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.1 Article16(2) is also an elaboration of a facet of Art. 16(1). These two clauses thus postulate the universality of Indian citizenship. As there is common citizenship, residence qualification is not required for service in any State. Public employment is a facet of right to equality envisaged under Article 16 of the Constitution of India.",

    "content": "These two clauses thus postulate the universality of Indian citizenship. As there is common citizenship, residence qualification is not required for service in any State. Public employment is a facet of right to equality envisaged under Article 16 of the Constitution of India. The State although is a model employer, its right to create posts and recruit people therefor emanates from the statutes or statutory rules and/or rules framed under the proviso appended to Article 309 of the Constitution of India. The recruitment rules are to be framed with a view to give equal opportunity to all the citizens of India entitled for being considered for recruitment in the vacant posts.2 On a comparative basis, Art. 16 deals with a very limited subject, viz., public employment. On the other hand, the scope of Art. 15(1) is much wider as it covers the entire range of state activities. The ambit of Art. 16(2) is restrictive in scope than that of Art. 15(1)3 because Art. 16(2) is confined to employment or office under the state, meaning services under the Central and State Governments and their instrumentalities. However, Art. 15 being more general in nature covers many varied situations of discrimination. Further, the prohibited grounds of discrimination under Art. 16(2) are somewhat wider than those under Art. 15(2) because Art. 16(2) prohibits discrimination on the additional grounds of descent and residence apart from religion, race, caste, sex and place of birth. Article 15 does not mention 'descent' and 'residence' as the prohibited grounds of discrimination, whereas Art. 16 does. Thus, with regard to the grounds of discrimination, Art. 15 is somewhat narrower than Art. 16. What Art. 16 guarantees is that all citizens in matters of state service shall be treated alike under like circumstances both in privileges and obligations. There should be no discrimination between one employee and another on the basis of any prejudice, bias or any extraneous ground. The word 'discrimination' in Art. 16(2) involves an element of unfavourable vice. As already noted, Art. 14 guarantees right of equality generally; Arts. 15 and 16 are instances of the same right of equality in specific situations. Art. 14 is the genus while Art. 16 is a species. Arts. 14 and 16 form part of the same constitutional code of guarantees and supplement each other. In other words, Art. 16 is only an instance of the application of the general rule of equality laid down in Article 14 and it should be construed as such. Accordingly, 'equality' in Art. 16(1) means equality as between member of the same class of employees, and not equality between members of separate, independent, classes. Equal protection of the laws does not postulate equal treatment of all persons without distinction; it merely guarantees the application of the same laws alike without discrimination to all persons similarly situated.4 Therefore, Art. 16 does not bar a reasonable classification of employees or reasonable tests for selection. Equality of opportunity of employment means selection. Equality of opportunity of employment means equality as between members of the same class of employees and not equality between members of separate, independent, classes. There can be no denial of equality of opportunity unless the person who complains of discrimination is equally situated with the person or persons who are alleged to have been favoured. Those who are similarly circumstanced are entitled to equal treatment. To illustrate the above proposition, reference may be made to Bagari.5The Army Act classifies army officers into various categories based on the requirements of the armed forces. TheSupreme Court has ruled that such a classification cannot be regarded as arbitrary. Art. 14 or 16 is not violated if different pay, perks or other privileges are granted to these officers. Thus, the distinction drawn between the commissioned officers, on the one hand, and the non-commissioned officers, on the other, in the matter of grant of study leave is not \"discriminatory, arbitrary or irrational\". It cannot be said that this distinction in the instant case is not founded Page 1072 on any intelligible differentia and that it has no relation with the object sought to be achieved. The character and duties of the two classes of officers are different.6 The State cannot amend the statutory rules adversely affecting the pension of retired employees with retrospective effect who became entitled to the benefits of the revised scales of pay, and consequently to the pension calculated on such basis7 Article 16(1) is much wider in scope than Art. 16(2) and the grounds of discrimination expressly mentioned in Art. 16(2) are not exhaustive. Art. 16(2) brings out emphatically, in a negative form, what is guaranteed affirmatively by Art. 16(1). Discrimination is a double edged weapon; it would operate in favour of some persons but against some others. Art. 16(2) prohibits discrimination and, thus, assures the effective enforcement of the Fundamental Right guaranteed in Art. 16(1). The emphasis in Art. 16(2) is on the word 'only'. Where there is discrimination only on the grounds mentioned therein, that Article may be attracted; but where discrimination is based partly on one such ground and partly on some other ground not mentioned in Art. 16(2), the matter may fall under Art. 16(1), but not under Art. 16(2). If the other ground is relevant for the purpose of appointment to the post, there is no contravention of the constitutional provision. Article 16 uses the term 'office' which is synonymous with the term 'office' used in Arts. 102(a) and 191(a) discussed earlier.8 'Office' means a subsisting, permanent, substantive position, having an existence independent of the person who fills it, which is filled in succession by successive holders and which has more or less a public character to which duties are attached.9 The equality guaranteed by Art. 16(1) takes within its fold all stages of service. The expression 'matters relating to employment' in Art. 16(1) is not restricted only to the initial stage of appointment; the expression \"appointment to an office\" in Art. 16(1) does not mean merely the initial appointment.

    "content": "takes within its fold all stages of service. The expression 'matters relating to employment' in Art. 16(1) is not restricted only to the initial stage of appointment; the expression \"appointment to an office\" in Art. 16(1) does not mean merely the initial appointment. Art. 16(1) includes all matters in relation to employment both prior, and subsequent, to the employment which are incidental to the employment or which form part of the terms and conditions of such employment, such as, salary, periodical increments, leave, promotion, fixation of seniority, gratuity, pension, superannuation and even termination of employment. The guarantee of Art. 16(1) could become illusory if narrowly construed, for then the state could comply with its formal requirement by affording equality at the initial stage, but defeat its object by making discriminatory provisions as regards other matters subsequently.10 Articles 16(1) and 16(2) give effect to Arts. 14 and 15. All these Articles form part of the same constitutional code of guarantees and supplement each other. Art. 16(1) should, therefore, be construed in a broad and general way, and not in a pedantic and technical way. When so construed, the expression \"matters relating to employment\" cannot mean merely matters prior to the act of appointment nor can \"appointment to any office\" mean merely the initial appointment; it must include all matters relating to employment, whether prior or subsequent to the employment, or whether these are either incidental to such employment or form part of its terms and conditions.11 The protection of Arts. 14 and 16 is available even to a temporary government servant if he has been arbitrarily discriminated against and singled out for harsh treatment in preference to his juniors, similarly circumstanced.12 As under Art. 14, so under Art. 16, equality cannot be a mathematical equality. Reasonable classification is permissible for various purposes relating to employment. The onus to establish discrimination is on him who asserts it. He has to show that the classification does not rest on any just or reasonable basis.13 Thus, differentiation made between graduate and non-graduate supervisors in the matter of promotion has been held not to be violative of Art. 16. A warning has however been sounded against \"mini-classifications based on micro-distinctions\".14 \"Every inconsequential differentiation between two things does not constitute the vice of discrimination, if law clubs them together ignoring venial variances.\" But when recruitment rules are made, employer is bound to comply with the same and in case of non compliance the appointment would be ultra vires the regulations as well as Page 1073 Articles 14 and 16 where the employer is a state owned or operated corporation.15 SEXUAL HARASSMENT An incident of sexual harassment of a female at the place of work, amounts to violation of her Fundamental Right to gender equality under Art. 16(2).16 B. MATTERS OF EMPLOYMENT (a) SERVICE CONDITIONS Under Art. 309, rules regulating service conditions of government servants can be made by the government,17 but such rules have to stand the tests of Arts. 14 and 16 and, thus, have to be reasonable and fair and not grossly unjust.18 In the absence of a rule or regulation, service conditions may be prescribed by executive instructions. The legal position of a government servant is more one of status rather than that of contract and his rights and duties are no longer determined by contract or consent of parties but by statutes or statutory rules, which may be unilaterally altered without the consent of the employees.19 But these rules have to be consistent with the Fundamental Rights.20 Reading Arts. 14 and 16 together, the Supreme Court has laid down several propositions regulating various aspects of service--from appointment to dismissal--of public servants. The endeavour of the Court has been to eliminate administrative discrimination, favouritism, arbitrariness and misuse of power from this area. Seniority is not a Fundamental Right. It is merely a civil right. Article 16 is applicable in the case of an appointment. It does not speak of fixation of seniority.21 Unilateral change of status of its employee by an instrumentality of the State is arbitrary violating Arts. 14 and 16.22 (b) APPOINTMENT Appointments can be made under executive power if no statutory service rules have been made. In the case noted below,23 power to make service rules for improvement trusts in the State vested in the State Government, but no such rules were made. The Supreme Court ruled that, in the absence of the rules, a trust could make appointments under its administrative power. The Court enunciated the following proposition: \"In the absence of any statutory rules governing the service conditions of the employees, the executive instructions and/or decisions taken administratively would operate in the field; appointments/promotions can be made in accordance with such executive instructions, administrative directions\". But if statutory rules are made, then the executive power to make appointments has to be exercised in accordance with them. The executive power can supplement the rules by filling the gaps therein, but cannot supplant the same.24 Appointments ought to be made strictly according to the rules. Appointments made in violation of the rules infringe Arts. 14 and 16 and, as such, the government cannot later regularise them.25 If ad hoc appointments have been made de hors the rules, these appointees ought to be replaced as soon as possible by regularly selected persons according to the rules. Such a temporary employee can also compete along with others for such regular selection. If he is selected, well and good; if he is not selected, he must give way to the regularly selected candidates. The government cannot relax rules for appointment. The Supreme Court has observed in this connection:26 \"Backdoor ad hoc appointments at the behest of power source or otherwise and recruitment according to rules are mutually antagonistic and strange bed partners. They cannot co-exist in the same sheath. The former is in negation of fair play.",

    "content": "government cannot relax rules for appointment. The Supreme Court has observed in this connection:26 \"Backdoor ad hoc appointments at the behest of power source or otherwise and recruitment according to rules are mutually antagonistic and strange bed partners. They cannot co-exist in the same sheath. The former is in negation of fair play. The later are the product of order and regularity.\" Page 1074 Ad hoc appointees who had been working for more than 13 years asked for regularisation of their appointments. The Supreme Court refused. Under the rules, regular appointments were to be made by the Public Service Commission. The principle is that recruitment to the service ought to be governed by the service rules and ought to be made by the appropriate authority. Consequently, ad hoc appointments would be only temporary appointments de hors the rules pending regular recruitment without conferring any right to regularisation of service.27 These qualifications to regularization have ultimately resulted in the Supreme Court declaring the regularization route impermissible. In Umadevi(3)28 a Constitution Bench held that any public employment has to be in terms of the Constitutional scheme. The Court also lamentably referred to the Courts' (perhaps including the Supreme Court also) issuing orders for regularizing recruitment. The argument advanced on behalf of the employees that an equity has arisen in their favour as a result of such appointments and their continuance of working was repelled by the Court. It also pointed out that the concept of \"equal pay for equal work\" is different from the concept of conferring permanency on those who have been appointed on adhoc or temporary or on no process of selection as envisaged in the concerned rules. Such regularization would also attract the vice of treating \"unequals as equal\" violating Articles 14 and 16. Appointments fall within the executive sphere, and can be made under administrative directions without formal rules having been made. But posts and conditions of service should be advertised before making the selections so that every one eligible for the posts may have an opportunity of being considered by the appointing authority.29 When a rule requires that before appointment to a post, it should be suitably publicised, appointment made to the post without publicity is invalid.30 An authority must be rigorously held to the standards by which it professes its action to be judged.31 Also, compliance with such a rule seems to be necessary in the name of fairplay. If a vacancy is advertised, all eligible persons may apply and the selection committee will have a large field to choose from. There will be no doubt of arbitrariness in the minds of eligible candidates for the post.32 Only so many posts ought to be filled as are advertised. It would be an improper exercise of power to make appointments over and above the posts advertised. It is only in a rare and exceptional circumstance and emergency situation that this rule can be deviated from. It is not as a matter of course that the appointing authority can fill up posts over and above those advertised. It should be clearly spelled out under what policy such a decision has been taken. Exercise of such power has to be tested on the touchstone of reasonableness.33 Where selection is to be made only on the basis of interview, and the number of applications for the posts are enormous with reference to the number of posts available to be filled up, the selection board should adopt some rational and reasonable basis to short list the candidates who have to be called for interview. The Supreme Court has decried the practice of calling a large number of candidates for interview for each post as it gives an opportunity for manipulation. Also, when large number of candidates have to be interviewed, interviews tend to be casual, superficial and sloppy and the true personality of the candidates cannot be assessed properly.34 Reasonable rules can be made, qualifications laid down,35 or reasonable selective tests and processes employed, for making selections for any employment.36 This means that there should be reasonable relation between the prescribed test for suitability of the candidate and the post as such.37 It is permissible for the government to prescribe appropriate qualifications for appointment or promotion to various posts.38 Qualifications for a particular post can be a \"rational differentia\" within the meaning of Art. 16. Prescription of stenographic ability of 100 words per minute is a relevant qualification. Educational qualification is an acceptable criterion for determining suitability for an appointment to a particular post or cadre. For example, a requirement that the professor in orthopaedics must have a post-graduate degree in the particular speciality is valid.39 Prescribing a first or second class post-graduate Page 1075 degree for the head of an educational institution has a direct nexus with the object of excellence sought to be achieved, and it cannot be said to be discriminatory. The posts of principals are not purely administrative; the principals have to take up teaching work in addition to their administrative duties.40 Educational qualifications can be made the basis for classification of employees in State service in the matter of pay scales, promotion, etc. Higher pay scale can be prescribed for employees possessing higher qualifications.41 Similarly, in the matter of promotion, classification on the basis of educational qualification so as to deny eligibility to a higher post to an employer possessing lesser qualifications is valid.",

    "content": "qualifications can justifiably be made the basis for qualification for the purpose of promotion to the higher post.42 A candidate for appointment for a post must have the requisite qualifications prescribed in the rules.43 When qualification has been prescribed for a post, that cannot be obliterated by posting those who do not fulfil that qualification as against those who have that qualification.44 For selection to an ex-cadre selection post, seniority is not relevant; the government can appoint to such a post a person whom it considers as the most suitable, and the Court will not interfere except on the ground of mala fides.45 Appointments based on the hereditary principle are bad because 'descent' is a prohibited ground of discrimination under Art. 16(2).46 Abolition of hereditary posts of village officers is neither arbitrary nor unreasonable because such posts are feudalistic in character and anachronisms in the modern age.47 A provision in the Punjab Police Rules, 1934, provided for giving preference in recruitment to sons and near relations of the police personnel. The provision was held to be invalid vis-a-vis Arts. 16(1) and (2).48 For the combined competitive examination--civil services examination, 1979, the candidates hailing from the Eastern States (Mizoram, Meghalaya, Negaland etc.) were given an option to take or not to take the paper on Indian languages. This was held to be non-discriminatory as these States have handicaps in the matter of language. These linguistically less advanced groups who are outside the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution may suffer serious disabilities if forced to take examinations in the languages set out in that Schedule. \"This concession is not contravention of equality but conducive to equality. It helps a handicapped group and does not hamper those who are ahead.\"49 Appointment of candidates by 'pick and choose' without preparing any merit list amounts to an arbitrary exercise of power.50 Generally speaking, the judicial approach is that appointments ought to be made on the basis of a written test plus a viva voce test and not solely on the basis of a viva voce test. While viva voce is an important factor, it ought not to be the sole factor in the process of selection. The reason is that reliance thereon may lead to \"sabotage of the purity of the proceedings\". There is always room for suspicion if common appointments are made through oral interview only. There may be posts requiring persons of mature personality and such posts may be filled solely on the basis of a viva voce test. The Supreme Court has ruled in Praveen Singh v. State of Punjab51 that the posts of block development officers at the panchayat level in the State do not require persons of mature personality and, therefore, appointment to these posts ought to be made on the basis of a written test and viva voce and not solely through viva voce.52 An individual applicant for any particular post does not get any right to be enforced by a mandamus unless and until he is selected in the process of selection and gets the letter of appointment.53 Mere inclusion of a candidate's name in the list of selected candidates does not confer on him any indefeasible right to be appointed unless the relevant rules so indicate. Such a candidate could feel aggrieved by his non-appointment only when the Administration does so either arbitrarily or for no valid or bona fide reason.54 Merely because the name of a candidate has been placed on the waiting list, it does not confer on him any right of being appointed to any post.55 A waiting list can remain in force only for a reasonable time and not in infinitum so that other qualified persons are not deprived of their chance of applying for the posts in the succeeding years and being selected for appointment.56 A waiting list cannot be used as a perennial source Page 1076 of recruitment filling up the vacancies not advertised. A candidate put on the waiting list cannot be appointed to a post arising subsequently without notifying the same for recruitment. Under Arts. 14 and 16, every one is entitled to claim consideration for appointment to a post under the State. The vacant posts arising or expected should be notified. No one can be appointed without due notification of vacancies and selection according to the rules.57 Termination of the services of temporary employees when duly selected candidates are available is valid in law.58 Articles 16 and 14 do not forbid the government from creating different cadres or categories of posts carrying different emoluments. Also, there is no bar in the way of the state integrating different cadres into one cadre. \"It is entirely a matter for the state to decide whether to have several different cadres or one integrated cadre in its services. That is a matter of policy which does not attract the applicability of the equality clause.\"59 The Supreme Court has deprecated the tendency of denying appointment to a person in government service on the ground of his political beliefs. In State of Madhya Pradesh v. Ramashankar Raghuvanshi, 60 the Court has emphasized that one cannot be turned back at the very threshold on the ground of his past political activities. According to the Court \"it offends the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Arts. 14 and 16 of the Constitution to deny employment to an individual because of his past political affinities, unless such affinities are considered likely to affect the integrity and efficiency of the individual's service.61 The Court has emphasized that \"the whole idea of seeking a police report on the political faith and the past political activity of a candidate for public employment appears to our mind to cut at the very root of the Fundamental Rights of equality of opportunity in the matter of employment, freedom of expression and freedom of association.\"62 Report on his involvement in any criminal or subversive activity can however be sought to determine his suitability for public employment.",

    "content": "State Public Service Commission announced the list of selected candidates for certain posts. Thereafter, the State Government forwarded to the Commission a list of candidates who were also selected for these posts under a rule authorising the Commission to consider any candidate who had requisite qualifications but did not apply. The Supreme Court quashed these appointments holding that the rule was intended not to bypass selections based on merit but only to cover candidates of exceptional merit. Here many of the candidates selected under the rule were found to be less meritorious than those selected earlier.63 A rule empowered the State Government to appoint any successful candidate at a service competitive examination to any cadre. A candidate was appointed to a lower cadre while other candidates lower in rank at the examination were appointed to a higher cadre. The rule was held to be discriminatory as it made no provisions for testing the candidate's suitability for a particular cadre, did not give an opportunity to a candidate to join the cadre of his preference and vested arbitrary power of patronage in the government as it could say at its sweet will that a particular candidate was more suitable for a particular cadre.64 In Janki Pd. v. State of Jammu & Kashmir, 65 the Supreme Court set aside the selections as it found the interview process to be thoroughly unsatisfactory. The interview committee did not take into account the service records of the candidates and the candidates who had secured even less than 30 per cent marks at the interview were selected. The Court ruled that selection made on such a poor basis cannot be regarded as a real selection at all. Where selection was made without interview or fake or ghost interviews, final records were tampered with and documents were fabricated, an inference can be drawn that the whole selection process was motivated by extraneous considerations. The entire selection process was set aside as being arbitrary. The selectees had no right to assume office.66 The Supreme Court commented on the whole episode as follows:67 \"The whole examination and the interview have turned out to be farcical exhibiting base character of those who have been responsible for this sordid episode. It shocks our conscience to come across such a systematic fraud.\" Page 1077 Reservation of 25% of posts for sons of bank employees and relaxation of educational qualifications and percentage of marks in their favour for appointment violates Arts. 16(1) and 16(2).68 Under Art. 16(2), residential requirement will be unconstitutional as a condition of eligibility for employment or appointment to an office under the State or its instrumentality.69 A service rule made by the Andhra Pradesh Government provided for 5% weightage to be given to Telugu medium candidates in the competitive examination held by the Public Service Commission in all Group II Service Examination. The Supreme Court declared the rule invalid vis-à-vis Arts. 14 and 16. The Court ruled that such a rule would frustrate the very concept of recruitment on merits to public posts. The Court also pointed out that the object of Arts. 14 and 16 is to ensure equality to all those who are similarly situated. In other words, all the citizens applying for employment under the State are entitled to be treated alike. If that is so then how having once allowed all candidates having minimum graduation qualification in any medium to compete for the posts, a further special benefit could be given only to the candidates having passed the minimum qualifying examination in the Telugu medium.70 A service rule requiring a female employee to obtain written permission of the government before solemnization of her marriage and denial of her right to be appointed on the ground that she was a married woman are discriminatory. The Supreme Court has said:71 \"We do not mean to universalize or dogmatise that men and women are equal in all occupations and all situations and do not exclude the need to pragmatise where the requirements of particular employment, the sensitivities of sex or the peculiarities of societal sectors or the handicaps of either sex may compel selectivity. But save where the differentiation is demonstrable, the rule of equality must govern.\" Giving preference in appointment to government posts on the basis of residence within a district or rural areas of a district has been held to run counter to the peremptory language of Art. 16(2). It has overtones of parochialism and runs counter to \"our constitutional ethos founded on unity and integrity of the nation\". Residence by itself--be it within a state, region, district or a lesser area within a district--cannot be a ground to accord preferential treatment or reservation, save as provided in Art. 16(3). \"It is not possible to compartmentalize the State into districts with a view to offer employment to the residents of that district on a preferential basis.\"72 (c) COMPASSIONATE APPOINTMENT Appointment on compassionate grounds of a son, daughter or widow to assist the family to relieve economic distress because of the sudden demise in harness of a government servant has been held to be valid vis-a-vis Arts. 16(1) and 16(2). The rationale underlying provision of compassionate appointments to the heirs of the deceased employee is that he was the bread winner for the family and his exit has left the family in the lurch and in precarious and vulnerable economic position.73 Appointment in public services on compassionate ground has been carved out, as an exception, in the interests of justice, to the general rule that appointments in the public services should be made strictly on the basis of open invitation of applications and merit and no other mode of appointment nor any other consideration is permissible.74 Such an appointment is to be made according to the rules and guidelines that may have been framed by the concerned authority. No person can claim appointment on compassionate grounds in disregard of such rules and guidelines.75 No such appointment can be made if no post is available.",

    "content": "person can claim appointment on compassionate grounds in disregard of such rules and guidelines.75 No such appointment can be made if no post is available. \"It will be a gross abuse of power of a public authority to appoint persons when vacancies are not available. If persons are so appointed and paid salaries, it will be a mere misuse of public funds, which is totally unauthorised.\"76 But if a vacancy is available, such an appointment should be made as soon as possible. \"It is improper to keep such case pending for years...\"77 Such appointment should be made immediately to redeem the family in distress. In Sushma Gosain,78 the candidate was kept waiting for four years. Criticising this, the Supreme Court observed: \"The denial of appointment is patently arbitrary and cannot be supported in any view of the Page 1078 matter\". There was absolutely no reason to make her to wait for such a long time. A rule denying compassionate employment if the employee dies within two years from the date of superannuation has been held to be valid under Art. 14 as the rule is not discriminatory.79 The Supreme Court has ruled that compassionate appointment is not to be made as a matter of course but only after examining the financial condition of the family. It is only if the concerned authority is satisfied that, but for the provision of employment, the family of the deceased employee will not be able to meet the crisis that a job is to be offered to an eligible member of the family. Such an appointment can be made only against the lowest post in non-manual and manual categories.80 (d) PROBATION As regards probation, the employer has the prerogative to put an employee on probation and watch his performance.81 (e) PROMOTION No employee has a vested right to promotion but he certainly has the right to be considered for promotion according to the rules. Chances of promotion are not conditions of service and are defeasible by law. A rule which merely affects the chances of promotion does not amount to a change in the conditions of service. But if a rule confers a right of actual promotion, or a right to be considered for promotion, is a service rule.82 As the Supreme Court has observed in State of Maharashtra v. Chandrakant Anant Kulkarni :83 \"Mere chances of promotion are not conditions of service and the fact that there was reduction in the chances of promotion did not tantamount to a change in the conditions of service. A right to be considered for promotion is a term of service, but mere chances of promotion are not\". A change in promotional policy by the Government was challenged by the employee concerned on the ground that, as a result thereof, his service conditions were adversely affected since his chances of promotion were adversely affected thereby. The Supreme Court rejected the challenge saying that a mere chance of promotion is not a condition of service, and the fact that there was reduction in the chances of promotion would not be tantamount to a change in the conditions of service. A right to be considered for promotion is a term of service, chances of promotion are not.84 The government can formulate or change the policy regarding promotions but the policy must conform to the principle of equality.85 Accordingly, promotion rules were held to be discriminatory and unjust in State of Uttar Pradesh v. Ramgopal .86 Persons holding posts in different grades or categories cannot claim equality in matters of promotion. Because of multifarious state activities, persons have to be employed in different cadres and classes. Each class may be a separate entity having its own rules of promotion.87 The railways provide the guards with a better channel of promotion to higher grade station-masters than to the roadside station-masters. This is not discriminatory as the guards and the station-masters belong to separate categories with separate avenues of promotion. Equality of opportunity cannot be predicated between them.88 'Equality' under Art. 16 means equality as between members of the same class of employees and not equality between members of separate, independent classes. Difficult questions have at times arisen in matters of promotion from lower to a higher grade within the same category. How far distinctions are permissible within the same class for promotion purposes? The general rule is that inequality of opportunity of promotion among members of a single class, which is based on no rational criteria, is not valid under Art. 16.89 The Supreme Court, generally speaking, does not countenance non-egalitarian 'micro-distinctions' in the area of promotions. The Supreme Court has warned that the doctrine of classification should not be taken to a point where instead of being a useful servant, it becomes a dangerous master. However, conditions Page 1079 designed to promote efficiency and best service have been accepted as valid, e.g., the basis of seniority-cum-merit.90 In a State, mamlatdars were recruited partly directly and partly by promotion from a lower grade. But after appointment, all mamlatdars were integrated into one cadre as they had the same designation, pay scale, functions, etc. It was held that as all mamlatdars formed one class, it would not be valid to accord a favoured treatment to the appointed mamlatdars qua the promotee mamlatdars, and thus to discriminate them, for purposes of promotion to the posts of deputy collectors.91 Once a cadre is formed by recruiting persons drawn from various departments, there would normally be no justification for discriminating between them by subjecting one class to more onerous terms in the matter of promotional chances.92 If, however, people being appointed to a cadre from different sources are not fully integrated into one class, then differential rules of further promotion according to the original source may be valid.93 Usually, the Supreme Court has upheld classification, for the purposes of promotion, based on educational qualifications.",

    "content": "one has always to bear in mind the facts and circumstances of the case in order to judge the validity of a classification.1 For example, in Kothandaraman,2 the Supreme Court has reiterated that higher educational qualification is a permissible basis of classification but the acceptability thereof will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. In the instant case, the Court found that differentiation between degree holders and diploma holders existed for a long time; that the degree holders were given different designation and gazetted status and a higher scale of pay whereas diploma holders did not enjoy these benefits. Thus, the higher educational qualification had relevance insofar as the higher promotional post was concerned, in view of the nature of the functions and duties attached to that post. \"The classification has, therefore, nexus with the object to be achieved.\" Thus, validity of classification has to be judged on the facts and circumstances of each case. In the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation, promotion to the post of superintending engineer was available to both degree-holder and diploma-holder executive engineers according to merit-cum-seniority. In 1988, the Corporation passed a resolution reserving 75% of the posts of superintending engineers to degree-holder executive engineers and 25% of these posts to diploma-holder executive engineers. The resolution was challenged on the ground that all executive engineers formed one cadre and did the same kind of work and, therefore, the classification made on the basis of educational qualifications was discriminatory under Arts. 14 and 16. But the Court rejected the contention and held the resolution valid saying that, for the purposes of promotion, a valid classification could be made among the members holding the same post on the basis of their qualifications. The Court also ruled that in the absence of a rule or regulation, service condition could be prescribed by executive instructions.3 On the other hand, there are some cases where in the context of the specific facts and circumstances, classification for the purpose of promotion, on the basis of educational qualifications has been held to be not reasonable. In the following case,4 a quota was fixed between diploma-holders and non-diploma holders among linemen for promotion to line superintendent. The Supreme Court struck down the classification made saying that \"all the linemen either diploma-holders or non-diploma-holders are performing the same kind of work and duties and they belong to the same cadre having a common/joint seniority list for promotion to the post of line Superintendent.\" In the instant case, because of the quota, linemen junior to the petitioner had been promoted and the Court regarded this as discriminatory and violative of the equality clause contained in Arts. 14 and 16. In an earlier case Mohammad Shujat Ali v. Union of India, 5 the Supreme Court had observed that \"it cannot be laid down as an invariable rule\" that any classification made on the basis of \"variant educational qualification\" would be valid, \"irrespective of the nature and purposes of the classification or the quality and extent of the differences in the educational qualifications\". The Court emphasized that the test of reasonable classification ought to be applied in each case on its peculiar facts and circumstances. In the instant case, a quota for promotion fixed for graduates and non-graduates was quashed. As both were regarded fit for promotion, fixing a quota between them and giving preferential treatment to graduates in the matter of promotion was held violative of the equality clause. Similarly, fixation of quota for promotion to the posts of excise inspectors between graduate and Page 1080 non-graduate preventive officers was held to be violative of Arts. 14 and 16. For all purposes they were being effectively treated as equal. They all constituted a single cadre and they were all equal members of it. More non-graduates were recruited to the service. The Court noted that all preventive officers whether graduate or non-graduate-performed the same type of work. Once they were promoted as excise inspectors, there was no distinction between graduate or non-graduate excise inspectors.6 In Food Corporation of India v. Om Prakash Sharma, 7 for purposes of promotion, the eligibility criterion was fixed at three years of service for graduates and five years of service for matriculates. This differentiation was quashed by the Supreme Court on the ground that the nature of work performed by the promotees was not such as to make differentiation between graduates and non-graduates. All promotees performed the same type of work. The corporation had placed no material before the Court to justify the classification between graduates and non-graduates. The differentiation was thus held unconstitutional as offending the equality clause. For purposes of promotion, two tests are generally applied, viz., \"merit-cum-seniority\" or \"seniority-cum-merit\". The second test involves consideration of inter se seniority of the employees who are eligible for consideration for promotion. The test means that \"given the minimum necessary merit requisite for efficiency of administration, the senior, even though less meritorious, shall have priority and a comparative assessment of merit is not required to be made.\"8 On the other hand, if the test of \"merit-cum-seniority\" is adopted then a comparative assessment of merit of the candidates is required to be made. This test lays greater emphasis on merit and not on length of service which plays a less significant role. Seniority is to be given weight if merit and ability are approximately equal.9 The Supreme Court has suggested to the Union and State Governments a complete change in the system of maintaining confidential rolls of their employees because a solution has to be found to the long delays in communicating the adverse entries against the employees and also against the misuse of the powers by officials who write the confidential reports. Under the prevailing system, entries are first made in the confidential report of an officer behind his back and then he is given an opportunity to make a representation against the entry by communicating the same to him after considerable time.",

    "content": "the prevailing system, entries are first made in the confidential report of an officer behind his back and then he is given an opportunity to make a representation against the entry by communicating the same to him after considerable time. Any representation made by him is considered by a higher authority some years later by which time any evidence that may be there to show that the entries made were baseless may have vanished. Suspensions, adverse remarks and frequent transfers from one place to another are ordered many a time without justification and without giving a reasonable opportunity to the employee concerned. Such actions surely result in the demoralisation of the services. The Courts could give very little relief in such cases. Hence the government itself should devise effective means to mitigate the hardship caused to the employees who are subjected to such treatment. The Court has made these observations while disposing of the case of Amar Kant Choudhary, a 1964 directly-recruited Deputy Superintendent of Police in Bihar, who was wrongly left out of the list by the selection committee for promotion on the basis of adverse entries in his confidential rolls which were not communicated to him for several years, and which were later expunged by the government. The Court directed that within four months, the selection committee must consider Mr. Choudhary's case for promotion, and if he is selected, he would be entitled to the seniority and all other consequential benefits flowing therefrom.10 The Supreme Court has clarified the position as regards promotion of an employee against whom disciplinary proceedings have been initiated. The Court has stated in State of Madhya Pradesh v. J.S. Bansal, 11 that if disciplinary proceedings are pending on the date on which names of other employees are considered for promotion to the next higher post, the delinquent employee if he is similarly circumstanced as other employees and is also eligible, has a right to be considered for promotion to the next higher post along with other employees. His name cannot be omitted from consideration merely because of the pendency of the departmental proceedings against him. An employee cannot be denied his right at the interlocutory stage of the departmental proceedings as he is still to be found to be guilty on the basis of the evidence to be produced against him. Only because of the suspicion against him, till the charges are proved, he cannot be deprived of his right to be considered for promotion. \"Mere suspicion is not a substitute for proof\". To consider him for promotion along with other eligible candidates is to effectuate his fundamental right which is available even to a delinquent employee under Arts. 14 and 16 of the Constitution. After considering him for Page 1081 promotion, the recommendation of the promotions committee is to be kept in a sealed cover so that if he is exonerated from the charge against him, he may be promoted immediately to the next higher post. (f) SENIORITY Difficult questions arise from time to time regarding fixation of inter se seniority in a cadre. Seniority is governed by service rules. No one has a vested right to seniority but an employee has an interest in seniority acquired by working out the rules. It can be taken away only by operation of a valid law.12 The rule-making authority can determine with objectivity and fairness what rules should govern the inter se seniority and ranking of the personnel working in the concerned department. But the rules so formulated should be reasonable, just and equitable.13 The rules ought not to be arbitrary and irrational resulting in inequality of opportunity amongst employees belonging to the same class.14 Revision of seniority inter se of employees in a grade arbitrarily without any rule or principle has been held to be invalid under Art. 16(1).15 Seniority of an officer is determined with reference to the date of his regular appointment made according to the rules. This is consistent with Arts. 14 and 16.16 Any earlier temporary or ad hoc service before regular appointment is to be considered as fortuitous and is not to be counted for purposes of seniority.17 Appointment in accordance with the rules is a condition precedent to count seniority.18 Temporary, ad hoc or fortuitous appointment, not being appointment according to the rules, cannot be counted towards seniority.19 The date of promotion to a particular grade or category determines the seniority in that grade or category.20 However, if the circumstances so require, a group of persons can be treated as a class separate from the rest, for any preferential or beneficial treatment while fixing their seniority.21 A University has merit promotee Professors and Readers and directly recruited Professor and Readers. The two constitute distinct classes as they are not at par with each other but are unequal in several respects. They cannot all be treated equally for the purposes of seniority. Fixation of inter se seniority of directly recruited Readers and Professors and those promoted on merit on the yardstick of continuous officiation has been held to be illegal and unconstitutional under Arts. 14 and 16(1). Seniority is to be fixed within the same class on the basis of continuous officiation.22 An ex cadre employee cannot be treated as a cadre employee for determining their inter se seniority as unequals cannot be treated as equals.23 A rule leaving \"the valuable right of seniority to depend upon the mere accident of confirmation\", notwithstanding the length of service is hit by Art. 16.24 Appointment of a person with retrospective effect so as to affect the seniority of others violates Arts. 14 and 16.25 Service conditions pertaining to seniority are liable to alteration, by subsequent changes in the relevant rules. Except to the extent of protecting promotions that have already been earned under the previous rules, the revised rules will govern the seniority and future promotion prospects of all the persons in the concerned service.",

    "content": "Court can, however, assess whether the principle for determining seniority laid down in the rules is \"just, fair and reasonable\", or whether it is unreasonable or arbitrary.26 The Supreme Court has said in Makashi that there is no invariable normal rule that seniority is to be determined only on the basis of the respective dates of appointment to the post and that any departure from such a rule will be prima facie unreasonable and illegal. The rule-making authority can formulate rules of seniority. However, such rules must be \"reasonable, just and equitable.\"27 (g) TRANSFER An order of transfer of an employee is a part of the service conditions. The Court does not interfere with such an order unless it is mala fide, or that the service rules prohibit such an order, or that the authority issuing the order was not competent to do so.28 A government employee, or a servant of a public undertaking, has no legal right to insist for being posted at any particular place unless specifically provided in his service conditions.29 Page 1082 When an honest officer was transferred by the Government because of the pressure of vested interests, the Supreme Court quashed the same characterising it as mala fide, a case of \"victimisation of an honest officer\" and not in public interest. The Court said, \"the transfer of the appellant is nothing but mala fide exercise of the power to demoralise honest officers who would efficiently discharge the duties of a public office.\"30 (h) COMPULSORY RETIREMENT Provision for compulsory retirement of government servants in public interest does not infringe Arts. 14 and 16. These Articles do not prohibit the prescription of reasonable rules for compulsory retirement31 which neither involves any civil consequences,32 nor any stigma.33 It is valid to put a ban on re-appointment of persons compulsorily retired as it has a reasonable basis and has some relation to the suitability for employment or appointment to an office.34 (i) RETIREMENT The expression \"conditions of service\" would take within its fold, fixation of the age of superannuation. Therefore, service rules made under Art. 309 may revise and reduce the age of retirement. In Nagaraj,35 the age of superannuation was reduced from 58 to 55 years by amending the service rules. The Supreme Court ruled that service rules can be amended under Art. 309.36 (j) TERMINATION There should be no discrimination in the matter of termination of service. Out of the 2000 officiating sub-inspectors of police, only the respondent was reverted while persons junior to him were allowed to officiate. This was held to be discriminatory and so bad under Art. 16.37 Dismissal of a person on the sole ground that he is a 'non-Andhra' was held void as amounting to discrimination only on the ground of place of birth which is prohibited by Art. 16(2).38 The constitutional provision draws no distinction between temporary and permanent posts and applies to all posts with equal rigour. Retrenchment of employees in a department by applying a selective test which is not arbitrary, unreasonable or discriminatory would not offend Art. 16. A selective test cannot be reasonable unless there is some proximate connection between the test and the efficient performance of duties and obligations of the particular office. Therefore, while retrenching staff, preference given to 'political sufferers' and 'displaced persons' and thus retained in service was not valid, for the circumstance of a person being a 'political sufferer' had no bearing on the question whether or not he would efficiently perform his duties.39 The services of a person employed in the Central Tractor Organisation were terminated after six years as being \"no longer required\". The Government also placed a ban on his being ever taken into service. Declaring the ban bad, the Court stated that the ban should have a reasonable basis and must have some relationship to his suitability for employment to an office. An arbitrary imposition of a ban against employment of a certain person under the government amounts to a denial of the right of equal opportunity of employment under Art. 16(1) which includes the right of being considered on merits for the post applied for.40 A rule empowering the government to terminate the services of a government employee by giving him one month's notice was held not invalid under Art. 16(1). Division of government service into permanent, quasi-permanent and temporary, and applying different rules of termination of service to different classes of government servants, does not involve discrimination. Nor would it amount to discrimination if the services of a person are dispensed with on the ground of unsatisfactory conduct, and persons junior to him are continued in service. It would, however, be a different matter if temporary employees were to be retrenched in which case qualifications and length of service of those holding temporary posts may be relevant, but not so in case of termination of service.41 Retaining the services of a junior while terminating the services of a senior, when it is not shown that the services of the latter are worse than those of the junior, is discriminatory and arbitrary.42 The services of a temporary employee were terminated without any reason while several employees similarly situated and junior to him in the same temporary cadre had been retained. This was held to be discriminatory and Page 1083 arbitrary and was hit by Art. 16. No discrimination may arise under Art. 16 if the services of a temporary servant are dispensed with because of \"unsatisfactory work or his unsuitability for the job\". But if his services are terminated arbitrarily, and not on the ground of his \"unsuitability, unsatisfactory conduct or the like\" which put him in a class apart from his juniors in the same service, then a question of unfair discrimination may arise.\"43 Services of eleven executive officers of several improvement trusts were terminated by the State Government. The Government justified this action by pleading that all the improvement trusts in the State were dissolved and hence these officers were rendered redundant.",

    "content": "Government justified this action by pleading that all the improvement trusts in the State were dissolved and hence these officers were rendered redundant. The Court found as a fact that the trusts were functioning as before and discharging their normal functions; the whole of the staff of the trusts was intact except the eleven officers. What had actually been dissolved were the boards of trustees of the trusts and not the trusts themselves. A trust had a corporate personality independent of the board of trustees. The Court thus found the reasons for dispensing with the services of the petitioners as untenable and the action of the Government arbitrary and violative of Arts. 14 and 16. The Court observed: \"... Such thoroughly arbitrary action cannot be sustained.\"44 The respondent never participated in any illegal, vicious or subversive activity after his appointment in government service. Nevertheless, he was dismissed from service on account of his political beliefs prior to his appointment. The Supreme Court held this to be invalid. Membership of a political party prior to his appointment is irrelevant for government service. Seeking of a report on the political faith of a candidate for government service is repugnant to the Constitution. Of course, a person cannot engage in political activity after entry in government service.45 A rule providing for a subsistence allowance of Re 1/- to a civil servant under suspension, and convicted of an offence, but pending appeal to a higher Court, is unreasonable and illusory and infringes Art. 16. He should get his normal allowance irrespective of whether he is in jail or on bail otherwise he cannot pursue his appeal effectively.46 Under a regulation made by the Delhi Transport Corporation, a public sector undertaking, services of an employee could be terminated by giving one month's notice. The Supreme Court declared the regulation to be arbitrary, unjust, unfair and unreasonable offending Arts. 14 and 16(1).47 C. EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK The Supreme Court has deduced the principle of \"equal pay for equal work\" from Arts. 14, 16 and 39(d) and the Preamble to the Constitution. No such principle is expressly embodied in the Constitution but the principle has now matured in a Fundamental Right. As the Supreme Court has explained in State of Madhya Pradesh v. Pramod Bhartiya, 48 the doctrine of \"equal pay for equal work\" is implicit in the doctrine of equality enshrined in Art. 14, and flows from it. The rule is as much a part of Art. 14 as it is of Art. 16(1). The doctrine is also stated in Art. 39(d), a directive principle, which ordains the State to direct its policy towards securing equal pay for equal work for both men and women.49 The Court has enunciated the doctrine as follows:50 \"The doctrine of equal work for equal pay would apply on the premise of similar work but it does not mean that there should be complete identity in all respects. If the two classes of persons do some work under the same employer, with similar responsibility, under similar working conditions, the doctrine of 'equal work equal pay', would apply and it would not be open to the State to discriminate one class with the other in paying salary.\" But it cannot be said that being a Directive Principle, it is not enforceable in a Court of law because it is also a part of Art. 14. The Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles are not supposed to be exclusionary of each other; they are complimentary to each other.51 The parameters for invoking the principle of equal pay for equal work include, inter alia, the nature of the Page 1084 work and common employer.52 The principle may properly be applied to the cases of unequal scales of pay based on no classification or irrational classification though those drawing the different scales of pay do identical work under the same employer.53 Thus, where all relevant considerations are the same, persons holding identical posts and discharging similar duties should not be treated differentially. Employees under one and the same employer holding the same rank, performing similar functions and discharging similar duties and responsibilities must also be given similar scales of pay. The Court has emphasized that this is not an abstract doctrine but one of substance. Though not declared expressly in the Constitution, it is certainly a constitutional goal. The principle has been applied in a large number of cases.54 The principle of equal pay for equal work does not apply when the employers are different. Employees of Regional Rural Banks sponsored by a co-operative bank cannot claim the same salary and allowances as are payable to the employees of Regional Rural Bank which are sponsored by the commercial and nationalised banks.55 Article 14, as already stated, permits reasonable classification which means that the classification is to be based on an intelligible basis which distinguishes persons or things grouped together from those that are left out of the group and that differentia must have a rational nexus with the object to be achieved by the differentia made. In other words, there ought to be causal connection between the basis of classification and the object of classification. The doctrine of equal pay for equal work applies in case of unequal scales of pay based on no classification or irrational classification, though those drawing the different scales of pay do identical work under the same employer. Accordingly, the Court has found it difficult to envisage a situation in research institutes where persons holding Doctorate qualification and enjoying the status of professor are governed by two different scales even though their duties, functions and responsibilities are identical.",

    "content": "in salary of driver constables in the Delhi Police Force and other drivers in the service of the Delhi Administration has been held to be irrational as there is no reason to give driver constables a lower scale than other drivers as their duties are more, not less, onerous than those of other drivers.56 The Court refused to accept the argument of the Delhi Administration that the circumstance that persons belong to different departments of the government is itself a sufficient reason to justify different scales of pay irrespective of the identity of their powers, duties and responsibilities. In Savita,57 classification between two groups of senior draughtsmen was held to be without any basis as they performed the same duties and the differentiation between them was not based on any intelligible ground. In Bhagwan Dass v. State of Haryana, 58 the Supreme Court has said that \"once the nature and functions and the work are not shown to be dissimilar the fact that the recruitment was made in one way or the other would hardly be relevant from the point of view of \"equal pay for equal work\" doctrine\". Also, the fact that appointments are for temporary periods and the schemes are temporary in nature is irrelevant. Once it is shown that the nature of the duties and functions discharged and the work done are similar, the doctrine of \"equal pay for equal work\" is attracted.59 But this principle cannot be applied invariably to professional services. For example, dressing of a wound by a doctor or a compounder cannot be equated and be compensated on an equal basis. Similarly, a senior or a junior lawyer cannot be treated equally in the matter of remuneration. \"In the field of rendering professional services at any rate the principle for equal work would be inapplicable.\" Therefore, doctors with different qualifications (Graduate or licensiates in indigenous medicine) can be graded differently for purposes of remuneration even though they are in charge of dispensaries.60 Classification on the basis of educational qualifications has always been upheld by the Supreme Court as reasonable and permissible under Art. 14. In the instant case,61 the Government of Karnataka had prescribed two different scales of pay for the tracers--a higher scale for matriculate tracers and a lower pay scale for non-matriculate tracers. The Court negatived the plea of discrimination by the non-matriculate Page 1085 tracers. The Court ruled that prescribing two different scales for matriculates and non-matriculates is not violative of Arts. 14 and 16 and that distinction made on the basis of technical qualifications or for that matter even on the basis of general educational qualifications relevant to the suitability of the candidate for public service is permissible. The Court proceeded on the assumption that both matriculates and non-matriculates \"were doing the same kind of work\", and yet the classification made was upheld as permissible under Arts. 14 and 16. In State of Jammu & Kashmir v. Triloki Nath Khosa, 62 the Assistant Engineers were classified into diploma holders and degree holders and more promotional avenues were provided to degree holders. This was upheld as reasonable. In Sita Devi,63 the Supreme Court upheld the distinction drawn by the Haryana Government between matriculate and under-matriculate instructors in the Adul literacy Programme. The under-matriculate petitioners had not made any attempt in their writ petition to allege and establish that their qualifications, duties and functions were similar to the matriculate teachers. In Markendeya v. State of Andhra Pradesh, 64 difference in pay scales between graduate supervisors holding degree in Engineering and non-graduate supervisors being diploma and licence-holders was upheld. It was held that on the basis of difference in educational qualifications such difference in pay scales was justified and would not offend Arts. 14 and 16. The Court pointed out that where two classes of employees perform identical or similar duties and carry out the same functions with the same measure of responsibility having the same academic qualifications, they would be entitled to equal pay. \"Principle of equal pay for equal work is applicable among equals. It cannot be applied to unequals\". Equal treatment cannot be accorded to totally distinct and unequal categories of employees.65 Thus, daily-rated workers cannot be equated with regular employees of the state in the matter of wages. There are differences of qualifications, age, manner of selection between the two categories of employees.66 The Court observed in Markandeya:67 \"Relief to an aggrieved person seeking to enforce the principle of equal pay for equal work can be granted only after it is demonstrated before the Court that invidious discrimination is practised by the State in prescribing two different scales for the two classes of employees without there being any reasonable classification for the same.\" Equality under Art. 16(1) means equality between members of the same class of employees and not between members of separate classes.68 Thus, giving special pay to members of Rajasthan Administrative Service, but not to the members of Secretarial Service, is not discriminatory as methods of recruitment, qualifications etc. of the two services are not identical.69 In Purshottam v. Union of India, 70 implementation of revised pay scales as recommended by the Pay Commission for certain categories of servants but non-implementation thereof for certain other categories was held to be discriminatory. The Government had made a reference to the Commission in respect of all its employees, and when it accepted its recommendations it should implement them in respect of all employees. Not to implement the recommendations with respect to some employees only violated Arts. 14 and 16.71 An army instruction conferring some benefit on those joining the Army Medical Corps after acquiring the post-graduate qualification was held not violative of Arts. 14 and 16. It was given as an incentive with a view to attract more persons having higher qualifications.72 In judging the equality of work, consideration may be given to educational qualifications, qualitative difference between posts and quantum of responsibilities associated with the posts.",

    "content": "and 16.71 An army instruction conferring some benefit on those joining the Army Medical Corps after acquiring the post-graduate qualification was held not violative of Arts. 14 and 16. It was given as an incentive with a view to attract more persons having higher qualifications.72 In judging the equality of work, consideration may be given to educational qualifications, qualitative difference between posts and quantum of responsibilities associated with the posts. If the classification has reasonable nexus with the objective of achieving efficiency in administration, the State would be justified in prescribing different pay scales. As the Supreme Court has emphasized: \"Equality must be among the equals. Unequal cannot claim equality\".73 A classification based on difference in educational qualifications justifies a difference in pay scales. A mere nomenclature designating a person as say a carpenter or a craftsman is not enough to come to the conclusion that he is doing the same work as another carpenter or craftsman in regular service. The quality of work which is produced may be different and even the nature of work assigned may be different. It is not just a comparison of physical activity. The application of the principle of equal pay for equal work requires consideration of various dimensions of a given job. The accuracy required and the dexterity that the job may Page 1086 entail may differ from job to job. It cannot be judged by the mere volume of work. There may be qualitative difference as regards reliability and responsibility. Functions may be the same but the responsibilities make a difference. Thus normally the applicability of this principle must be left to be evaluated and determined by an expert body. These are not matters where a writ Court can lightly interfere.74 In Federation of A.I. Custom and Central Excise Stenographers (Recog.) v. Union of India, 75 the Supreme Court has emphasized that equal pay must depend on the \"nature of the work done\", and not \"mere volume of work\" as \"there may be qualitative difference as regards reliability and responsibility\". \"Functions may be the same but the responsibilities make a difference.\" The Court has further observed: \"The same amount of physical work may entail different quality of work, some more sensitive, some requiring more tact, some less--it varies from nature and culture of employment. The problem about equal pay cannot always be translated into a mathematical formula.............\" In the instant case, stenographers attached with officers in the pay scales of Rs. 2500-2750 claimed parity with the stenographers attached with the Joint Secretaries and Officers above that rank. Their contention was that they held identical posts and discharged same functions. Nevertheless, the Court rejected their contention saying that \"it is not possible to say that the differentiation is based on no rational nexus with the object sought for to be achieved\". The Government had justified the differentiation amongst the two classes of stenographers on the ground of difference in their responsibility, confidentiality and the relationship with public. The claim of the employees of grih kalyan kendras for pay parity with the employees working in the New Delhi Municipal Committee and other departments of the Delhi Administration was rejected by the Supreme Court.76 These kendras are run by a welfare organisation working under the aegis of the Deptt. of Personnel and Administrative Reforms. Employment in these kendras is unique in character and not comparable with any other employment. \"It is difficult to conceive of any other service which one can enter at any age, regardless of educational qualifications, and from which one can retire when one chooses\". Therefore, the principle of equal pay for equal work cannot be applied to kendra employees. It is trite that the concept of equality implies and requires equal treatment for those who are situated equally. One cannot draw comparisons between unequals. In State of Madhya Pradesh v. Pramod Bhartiya, 77 the lecturers working in the higher secondary schools in Madhya Pradesh claimed parity in pay with lecturers working in Technical schools. The qualifications prescribed for, and service conditions of, both groups of lecturers were the same and the status of both types of schools was also the same. Nevertheless, the Court still refused to concede to the lecturers in higher secondary schools the same pay as the lecturers in the Technical schools were getting on one ground, viz., there was no material to suggest that the functions and responsibilities of both the categories of lecturers was qualitatively speaking similar. On this crucial point, the Court observed:78 \"It is not enough to say that the qualifications are same nor is it enough to say that the schools are of the same status. It is also not sufficient to say that the service conditions are similar. What is more important and crucial is whether they discharge similar duties, functions and responsibilities.\" The Court went on to observe that the quality of work may vary from post to post, institution to institution. \"We cannot ignore or overlook this reality. It is not a matter of assumption but one of proof.\" The Court also clarified another significant point. Since the plea of equal pay for equal work has to be examined with reference to Art. 14, the burden is upon the petitioners to establish their right to equal pay, or the plea of discrimination, as the case may be.79 In the instant case, the petitioners (respondents before the Supreme Court) failed to discharge this onus. The principle of \"equal pay for equal work\" does not apply to two sets of employees working in different organisations and when there is qualitative difference in the duties and functions discharged by them.80 At times, it may prove very difficult for the Court to apply the principle of equal pay for equal work as there Page 1087 are inherent difficulties in comparing and evaluating work done by different persons in different organizations, or even in the same organization.81 Often the difference is a matter of degree and there is an element of value judgment.",

    "content": "Supreme Court has observed in this connection:82 \"So long as such value judgment is made bona fide reasonably on an intelligible criterion which has a rational nexus with the object of differentiation, such differentiation will not amount to discrimination. It is important to emphasize that equal pay for equal work is a concomitant of Art. 14 of the Constitution. But it follows naturally that equal pay for unequal work will be a negation of that right.\" The above discussion reveals that the initial zeal to do justice got tempered by too many claims for equality requiring the Court to take up intensive factual enquiry beyond its competence. However in Dineshan, after noticing the restrictive approach of the Supreme Court in relation to the principle of \"equal pay for equal work\" it was held held that it would not be correct to lay down as an absolute rule that merely because determination and granting of pay scale is the prerogative of the executive, the Court had no jurisdiction to examine any pay structure and an aggrieved employee has no remedy if he is unjustly treated by arbitrary State action or inaction. It was pointed out that when there is no dispute with regard to the duties and responsibilities of the persons who held identical posts or ranks but they are treated differently merely because they belonged to different departments or the basis of classification of posts which is ex facie irrational, arbitrary or unjust, the Court had power to intervene.83 The case, however, is important because of the virtual resurrection of the principle as to the reviewability of an issue relating to equal pay for equal work and Article 14 in that context. Like in some other areas the Court has adopted a restrictive approach perhaps because of realizing that it had opened the doors wider than what was required. On the authority of Charanjit Singh84 it has been held that Art. 39(d) could be of no assistance for application of the rule of equal pay for equal work unless the Court is satisfied that the incumbents are performing equal and identical work as discharged by the employees vis-à-vis whom the claim is made.85 The Court could have avoided the 'identity' criterion since the claim in the case involved obviously different classes of teachers on the one hand and clerical staff on the other. D. EXCEPTIONS TO ARTS. 16(1) & 16(2) The right of equality guaranteed by Arts. 16(1) and (2) are subject to a few exceptions. (a) ART. 16(3) First, under Art. 16(3), Parliament may make a law to prescribe a requirement as to residence within a State or Union Territory for eligibility to be appointed with respect to specified classes of appointments or posts. Thus, Art. 16(2) which bans discrimination of citizens on the ground of 'residence' only in respect of any office or employment under the state, can be qualified as regards residence, and a 'residential qualification' imposed on the right of appointment in the State for specified appointments. This provision, therefore, introduces some flexibility, and takes cognisance of the fact that there may be some very good reasons for restricting certain posts in a State for its residents. Article 16(3), however, incorporates a safeguard to ensure that it is not abused. Power has been given to Parliament and not to the State Legislatures to relax the principle of non-discrimination on the ground of residence so that only a minimum relaxation is made in this regard. The State Legislatures being subjected to greater local pressures might have been tempted to create all kinds of barriers in the matter of public services. Under Art. 16(3), Parliament has enacted the Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act, 1957. The Act repeals all laws in force prescribing a requirement as to residence within a State or Union Territory except Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura and Telengana--the area transferred to Andhra Pradesh from the erstwhile State of Hyderabad. Due to the backwardness of these areas, the Act permits prescription of a residential qualification for a period up to March 21, 1974, in regard to non-gazetted services. Page 1088 In A.V.S. Narasimha Rao v. State of Andhra Pradesh, 86 the Supreme Courtdeclared that part of the Act unconstitutional which prescribed a residence qualification for government services in Telengana--a part of the State of Andhra Pradesh. The Court took the view that under Art. 16(3), Parliament can impose a residential qualification for services in the whole State, but not in a part of the State, for Art. 16(3) uses the word 'State' which signifies 'State' as a unit and not parts of a State as districts, taluqs, cities, etc. Art. 16(3) speaks of the whole state as the venue for residential qualification. Thus, while Parliament can reserve certain posts in the State of Andhra Pradesh for the residents of the State, it cannot reserve posts in Telengana (which is a part of the State) for the residents of Telengana. The life of this Act came to an end in 1974. For Andhra Pradesh, however, some special provisions have been made under Art. 371D.87 (b) ART. 16(5) Secondly, Art. 16(5) provides that a law may prescribe that the incumbent of an office in connection with the affairs of a religious or denominational institution, or a member of the governing body thereof, shall belong to the particular religion or denomination. (c) ART. 16(4) Thirdly, Art. 16(4) constitutes a very significant exception to the principle of equality embodied in Art. 16(1) and, therefore, needs to be discussed in some detail. E. RESERVATIONS IN SERVICES : ART. 16(4) Under Art. 16(4), the state may make reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any 'backward class' of citizens which, in the opinion of the state, is not adequately represented in the public services under the state.",

RESERVATIONS IN SERVICES : ART. 16(4) Under Art. 16(4), the state may make reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any 'backward class' of citizens which, in the opinion of the state, is not adequately represented in the public services under the state. The term 'state' denotes both the Central and the State Governments and their instrumentalities.88 State as an employer is entitled to fix separate quotas of promotion for degree holders, diploma holders and certificate holders in exercise of its rule making power under Art. 309.89 Explaining the nature of Art. 16(4), the Supreme Court has stated in Mohan Kumar Singhania v. Union of India, 90 that it is \"an enabling provision\" conferring a discretionary power on the state for making any provision or reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which, in the opinion of the state, is not adequately represented in the service of the state. Art. 16(4) neither imposes any constitutional duty nor confers any Fundamental Right on any one for claiming reservation.91 Under Art. 16(4), it is incumbent on a State Government to reach a conclusion that the backward class/classes for which the reservation is made is not adequately represented in the State services. Different States may have different methods of reservation and it is not for the Court to look into the wisdom of the method adopted.92 While doing so, the State Government may take the total population of a particular backward class and representation in the State services. When the State Government after doing the necessary exercise makes the reservation and provides the extent of percentage of posts to be reserved for the said backward class, then the percentage has to be followed strictly. If some Scheduled Caste or backward class candidates are appointed or promoted against the general posts, they are not to be counted against the reserved posts. The number ofreserved posts cannot be reduced on this account. The State may, however, on an overall view of the situation review the matter and refix the percentages of reservation.93 Reservation does not rule out merits. Judging of merit may be at several tiers. It may undergo several filtrations. Ultimately, the constitutional scheme is to have the candidates who would be able to serve the society and discharge the functions attached to the office. Vacancies are not filled up by way of charity. Emphasis has all along been made, times without number, to select candidates and/or students based upon their merit in each category. The disadvantaged group or the socially backward people may not be able to compete with the open category people but that would not mean that they would not be able to pass the basic minimum criteria laid down therefor.94 One of the tests to be applied when a statutory provision for reservation is challenged is whether the width of Page 1089 the power has given rise to excessive reservation and that as to whether this wide extent would make an inroad into the principles of equality under Article 16(1) and it is for the state concerned to show in each case the extent of the existence of compelling reasons, namely backwardness, inadequacy of representation and overall administrative efficiency before making provision for reservation. Since, however, the constitutional amendments which were under challenge were enabling provision, it was open to the state to exercise their discretion to make such provisions after collecting quantifiable date showing backwardness of the class and inadequacy of representation of that class in public employment in addition to compliance with Art. 355 subject to the clarification that the reservation provision does not exceed the ceiling limit of 50% or obliterate the creamy layer or extend the reservation indefinitely.1 Further Art. 16(4) has to be interpreted in the background of Art. 335.2 The equality of opportunity guaranteed by Art. 16(1) is to each individual citizen of the country while Art. 16(4) contemplates special provision being made in favour of the socially disadvantaged classes. Both must be balanced against each other. Neither should be allowed to eclipse the other. Accordingly, the rule of 50% reservation in a year should be taken as a unit and not the entire strength of the cadre, service or the unit as the case may be.3 The term 'Backward Class', as used in Art. 16(4), takes within its fold Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Art. 15(4) speaks about \"socially and educationally backward classes of citizens\". Art. 16(4) speaks only of \"any backward class of citizens.\" However, it has been settled by a series of judicial pronouncements that the expression \"backward class of citizens\" in Art. 16(4) means the same thing as the expression \"any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens\" in Art. 15(4). Thus, to qualify for being called a 'backward class citizen' under Art. 16(4), one must be a member of a 'socially and educationally backward class'.4 It has been emphasized that the expression \"Backward Class\" is not synonymous with \"backward caste\" or \"backward community\". In determining whether a section of population forms a Backward Class for purposes of Art. 16(4), a test solely based on caste, community, race, religion, sex, descent, place of birth or residence cannot be adopted because it would directly be violative of Art. 16(2).5 Article 16(4) does not, however, cover the entire ground covered by Arts. 16(1) and 16(2). Some of the matters relating to employment in respect of which equality of opportunity has been predicated by Arts. 16(1) and 16(2) do not fall within the scope of the non-obstante clause in Art. 16(4). For instance, as regards conditions of service relating to employment, such as, salary increment, gratuity, pension and age of superannuation are matters relating to employment and, as such, they do not form the subject matter of Art. 16(4). It means that, in these matters, there can be no exception even in regard to the backward classes of citizens.",

    "content": "and 16(2) do not fall within the scope of the non-obstante clause in Art. 16(4). For instance, as regards conditions of service relating to employment, such as, salary increment, gratuity, pension and age of superannuation are matters relating to employment and, as such, they do not form the subject matter of Art. 16(4). It means that, in these matters, there can be no exception even in regard to the backward classes of citizens. In other words, these matters relating to employment are absolutely protected by the doctrine of equality and do not form the subject-matter of Art. 16(4). Article 16(4) neither confers a right on anyone to claim, nor imposes a constitutional duty on the government to make, any reservation for any one in public services. It is merely an enabling provision and confers a discretionary power on the state to reserve posts in favour of backward classes of citizens, which, in its opinion, are not adequately represented in the state services. A balance needs to be struck between individual rights under Arts. 14 and 16(1), on the one hand, and the affirmative action taken by the state under Art. 16(4). Therefore, reservation under Art. 16(4) has to be within reasonable and legitimate limits. In making reservation under Art. 16(4), the state cannot ignore the Fundamental Rights of the rest of the citizens.6 The amalgamation of two classes of people for reservation would be unreasonable as two different classes are treated similarly which is in violation of the mandate of Article 14 which mandates 'to treat similar similarly and to treat different differently\". It is well settled that to treat different unequals as equals violates Article 14 of the Constitution.7 Article 16(4) does not envisage any reservation in services independent of backwardness. Reservation of posts was made in a State on the basis of various castes and communities like Harijans, backward Hindus, Page 1090 Muslims, Hindu Brahmins, non-Brahmins and Christians. The Supreme Court ruled in Venkataraman8 that Art. 16(4) expressly permits reservation of posts in favour of backward classes but not with regard to those not regarded as backward. While reservation of posts in favour of any backward class of citizens cannot be voided, reservation of posts between Hindus, Muslims and Christians infringes Arts. 16(1) and (2).9 This is not reservation for backward classes but distribution of posts on the basis of community, a ground prohibited by Art. 16(2). The expression 'backward class' used in Art. 16(4) is not synonymous with 'backward caste' or 'backward community'. To determine whether a section of the population forms a 'class' for purposes of Art. 16(4), a test solely based on caste, community, race, religion, sex, descent, place of birth or residence cannot be adopted. In Rangachari,10 the validity of the circulars issued by the Railway Administration providing for reservation in favour of the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes in promotions (by selection) was questioned. The argument was that Art. 16(4) was confined to direct recruitment only and did not comprehend reservation in the matter of promotions as well. The Supreme Court ruled by a majority of 3 : 2 that under Art. 16(4), reservation in government services can be made not only at the initial stage of recruitment, but even in the matter of promotion from a lower to a higher post or cadre. Thus, selection posts can also be reserved for backward classes. The Court went on to explain that the expression 'adequately represented' in Art. 16(4) imports considerations of 'size' as well as 'values', numbers as well as the nature of appointments held and so it involves not merely the numerical test but also the qualitative one. Adequacy of representation of backward classes in any service has to be judged by reference to numerical as well as qualitative tests. The advancement of the socially and educationally backward classes require not only that they should have adequate representation in the lowest rung of services but that they should secure adequate representation in selection posts as well. Inadequacy of representation of backward classes can be cured by applying reservation to senior posts as well. The Courts have interpreted Art. 16(4) liberally because the Constitution attaches great importance to advancement of backward classes. However, reservation should not be excessive for two reasons. One, Art. 33511 enjoins that in taking into consideration the claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the making of appointments in connection with the affairs of the Union or a State, the policy of the State should be consistent with \"the maintenance of efficiency of administration\". Insisted the Court: \"It must not be forgotten that the efficiency of administration is of such paramount importance that it would be unwise and impermissible to make any reservation at the cost of efficiency of administration.\" Therefore, the Court observed:12 \"There can be no doubt that the Constitution-makers assumed ......... that while making adequate reservation under article 16(4) care would be taken not to provide for unreasonable, excessive or extravagant reservation....Therefore, like the special provision improperly made under Article 15(4), reservation made under article 16(4) beyond the permissible and legitimate limits would be liable to be challenged as a fraud on the Constitution.\" Secondly, because Art. 16(4) forms an exception to Arts. 16(1) and 16(2), Art. 16(4) could not be given such an operation as to destroy the main Articles. Reservation for backward classes could not be so excessive which would in effect efface the guarantee under Art. 16(1) of equal opportunity in the matter of public employment, or at best make it illusory. (a)BALAJI The locus classicus on this question is the Balaji case.13 In this case, the Court attempted to impose a constitutional limit on the extent of preference, not on the \"narrower ground of reservation,\" but on the broader grounds of policy. The Court spoke of adjusting the interests of the weaker sections of society with the interests of the community as a whole.",

    "content": "of equal opportunity in the matter of public employment, or at best make it illusory. (a)BALAJI The locus classicus on this question is the Balaji case.13 In this case, the Court attempted to impose a constitutional limit on the extent of preference, not on the \"narrower ground of reservation,\" but on the broader grounds of policy. The Court spoke of adjusting the interests of the weaker sections of society with the interests of the community as a whole. The Court declared that a formula must be evolved which would strike a reasonable balance between the several relevant considerations. While striking down as unconstitutional a government order by which 68% of the seats in educational institutions were reserved for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other Backward Classes on the Page 1091 ground of excessive reservation and as a fraud on the Constitution, the Court observed:14 \"Speaking generally and in a broad way, a special provision should be less than 50 per cent; how much less than 50 per cent would depend upon the relevant prevailing circumstances in each case.\" (b)DEVADASAN Immediately thereafter came the Devadasan15 case before the Supreme Court in which the Court was required to adjudge the validity of the 'carry forward' rule. The 'carry forward' rule envisaged that in a year, 17½ per cent posts were to be reserved for Scheduled Castes/Tribes; if all the reserved posts were not filled in a year for want of suitable candidates from those classes, then the shortfall was to be carried forward to the next year and added to the reserved quota for that year, and this could be done for the next two years. The result of the rule was that in a year out of 45 vacancies in the cadre of section officers, 29 went to the reserved quota and only 16 posts were left for others. This meant reservation upto 65% in the third year, and while candidates with low marks from the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes were appointed, candidates with higher marks from other classes were not taken. Basing itself on the Balaji principle, the Supreme Court declared that more than 50 per cent reservation of posts in a single year would be unconstitutional as it per se destroys Art. 16(1). The Court emphasized that in the name of advancement of backward communities, the Fundamental Rights of other communities should not be completely annihilated. By a majority of 4:1, the Court held that as Art. 16(4) was a proviso or an exception to Art. 16(1), it should not be interpreted so as to nullify or destroy the main provision, as otherwise it would in effect render the guarantee of equality of opportunity in the matter of public employment under Art. 16(1) wholly illusory and meaningless. The Court observed: \"The overriding effect of Cl. (4) of Art. 16 on Cls. (1) and (2) could only extend to the making of a reasonable number of reservations of appointments and posts in certain circumstances. A 'reasonable number' is one which strikes a reasonable balance between the claims of the backward classes and those of other citizens.\" The Court emphasized that each year of recruitment has to be considered by itself and the reservation for backward communities should not be so excessive as to create a monopoly or to disturb unduly the legitimate claims of other communities. The Supreme Court has ruled in Arati16 that in order to effectuate the guarantee contained in Art. 16(1), each year of recruitment has to be considered separately by itself and \"the reservation for backward communities should not be so excessive as to create a monopoly or to disturb unduly the legitimate claims of other communities\". Reservation for vacancies up to 45% in a year has been held valid in the instant case. The Supreme Court has observed in the case noted below,17 that Art. 16(4) is an enabling provision and the reservation thereunder should not exceed legitimate limits. In making reservations for the backward classes, the State cannot ignore the Fundamental Rights of the rest of the citizens. The above-mentioned judicial decisions did, on the whole, improve the position of the Scheduled Castes, etc. But an optimum limit on reservation of posts in their favour in any one year was also placed. Underlying the Devadasan case was the feeling on the part of the judiciary that filling of senior posts by not so qualified candidates in preference to the better qualified candidates, while discriminatory to the latter, was also subversive of administrative efficiency. It was this feeling which had led the minority in the Rangachari case to confine Art. 16(4) to initial appointments only. But the majority thought otherwise. That the majority view in the Rangachari case was full of pit-falls was soon revealed in the Devadasan case. The governments in India have been under a great political pressure to make larger and larger reservations in favour of various categories of persons both in the services as well as admission to technical institutions.18 By prescribing the optimum limit on such reservations, both under Arts. 15(4) and 16(4), the Supreme Court did seek to help the governments to withstand these pressures to some extent in the interests of Page 1092 administrative efficiency or educational standards. (c) THOMAS In State of Kerala v. N.M. Thomas .19 the Supreme Court held that it was permissible to give preferential treatment to Scheduled Castes/Tribes under Art. 16(1) outside Art. 16(4). In Devadasan, the majority had taken the view that Art. 16(4) was an exception to Arts. 16(1) an 16(2). This was the view expressed also in Balaji and Rangachari. On the other hand, in Devadasan, in a dissenting opinion, Subba Rao, J., had expressed the opinion that Art. 16(4) was not an exception to Art. 16(1), but was a legislative device by which the framers of the Constitution had sought to preserve a power untrammelled by the other provisions of the Article. It was a facet of Art.",

    "content": "the other hand, in Devadasan, in a dissenting opinion, Subba Rao, J., had expressed the opinion that Art. 16(4) was not an exception to Art. 16(1), but was a legislative device by which the framers of the Constitution had sought to preserve a power untrammelled by the other provisions of the Article. It was a facet of Art. 16(1) as \"it fosters and furthers the idea of equality of opportunity with special reference to under privileged and deprived classes of citizens.\" In Thomas, the majority accepted this view of Subba Rao, J. Accordingly, the Court observed: \" Art. 16(4) is not in the nature of an exception to Art. 16(1). It is a facet of Art. 16(1) which fosters and furthers the idea of equality of opportunity with special reference to an under privileged and deprived class of citizens....\" Thus, Art. 16(1) being a facet of the doctrine of equality enshrined in Art. 14 permits reasonable classification just as Art. 14 does. The majority ruled in Thomas that Art. 16(4) is not an exception to Art. 16(1). Art. 16(1) itself permits reasonable classification for attaining equality of opportunity assured by it. For assuring equality of opportunity, it may be necessary in certain situations to treat unequally situated persons unequally. Not doing so would perpetuate and accentuate inequality. Art. 16(4) is an instance of classification implicit in, and permitted by, Art. 16(1). The \"backward class of citizens\" are classified as a separate category deserving a separate treatment in the nature of reserving appointments or posts in the services of the state. Art. 16(4) should be read along, and in harmony, with Art. 16(1). Indeed even without Art. 16(4), the state could have reserved posts for backward classes. Art. 16(4) merely puts the matter beyond any doubt or controversy in specific terms. However, two judges expressing a dissenting view in Thomas adhered to the majority view in Devadasan that Art. 16(4) was an exception to Arts. 16(1) and (2). In their view, Art. 16(1) only embodied the notion of formal or legal equality and, therefore, there was no scope for spelling out any concept of preferential treatment from the language of Art. 16(1). Thomas marks the beginning of a new judicial thinking on Art. 16 and leads to greater concessions to S/C, S/T and other backward persons. If the Supreme Court had stuck to the view propagated in earlier cases that Art. 16(4) was an exception to Art. 16(1), then no reservation for any other class, such as army personnel, freedom fighters, physically handicapped, could have been made in services.20 The fact situation in Thomas was that the Kerala Government made rules to say that promotion from the cadre of lower division clerks to the higher cadre of upper division clerks depended on passing a test within two years. For S/Cs and S/Ts, exemption could be granted for a longer period. These classes were given two extra years to pass the test. This exemption was challenged as discriminatory under Art. 16(1) on the ground that Art. 16 permitted only reservation in favour of backward classes but it was not a case of reservation of posts for S/Cs and S/Ts under Art. 16(4) and that these persons were not entitled to any favoured treatment in promotion outside Art. 16(4). By majority, the Supreme Court rejected the argument. It ruled that Art. 16(1) being a facet of Art. 14, would permit reasonable classification and, thus, envisaged equality between the members of a the same class of employees but not equality between members of a separate, independent class. Classification on the basis of backwardness did not fall within Art. 16(2) and was legitimate for the purposes of Art. 16(1). Giving preference to an under-represented backward community was valid and would not contravene Arts. 14, 16(1) and 16(2). Art. 16(4) removes any doubt in this respect. In the words of Ray, C.J.: \"The classification of employees belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for allowing them an extended period of two years for passing the special tests for promotion is a just and reasonable classification having rational nexus to the object of providing equal opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to public office.\"21 Page 1093 It was emphasized that the basic qualification for promotion, viz., seniority, was not being relaxed in case of S/Cs and S/Ts. Only a temporary relaxation was being given in the passing of the qualification test. This was warranted by their inadequate representation in the services and their over-all backwardness. Without providing for such a relaxation for a temporary period, it would not have been possible to give adequate promotion to the lower division clerks belonging to the S/Cs and S/Ts. To achieve equality, differential treatment of persons who are unequal was permissible. This is characterised as \"compensatory discrimination\" or \"affirmative action\". It was also emphasized that Scheduled Caste was not a caste within the ordinary meaning of caste as envisaged by Art. 16(2). S/Cs were notified by the President under Art. 341.22 The object of Art. 341 was to provide protection to the members of the S/Cs having regard to the economic and educational backwardness from which they suffer. However, the over-all needs of administrative efficiency must be kept in view. A view was also expressed that the rule of 50% reservation evolved in Balaji was \"a mere rule of caution\" and was not meant to be exhaustive of all categories.23 The minority view, on the other hand, was that the principle of classification could not be extended so as to confer a preferential treatment on members of the S/Cs and S/Ts outside Art. 16(4). The principle of preferential treatment for backward classes was contained in Art. 16(4) and Art. 16(1) would not warrant any preference to any citizen against the other. A classification based upon the consideration that an employee belonged to a particular section of the population with a view to accord preferential treatment for promotion would be a clear violation of Art.",

    "content": "The principle of preferential treatment for backward classes was contained in Art. 16(4) and Art. 16(1) would not warrant any preference to any citizen against the other. A classification based upon the consideration that an employee belonged to a particular section of the population with a view to accord preferential treatment for promotion would be a clear violation of Art. 16(1). Classification and differential treatment for purposes of promotion among employees who possessing the same educational qualifications were initially appointed, as in the present case, to the same category of posts was not permissible. Any exemption, temporary or otherwise, could not validly be granted to one set of employees withholding the same from the other. The majority adopted a very liberal attitude in Thomas as regards S/Cs and S/Ts and backward classes. The result of the pronouncement is to enable the state to give the backward classes a preferential treatment in many different ways other than reservation of posts as envisaged in Art. 16(4). This would, no doubt, help the backward classes a great deal. But there lurks a danger also in this formulation. The guarantee of equality could be completely eroded if this preferential treatment is overdone under political pressure. Thus, the obligation of the Courts to be ever vigilant in this area does correspondingly increase. After all, preferential treatment for one is discriminatory treatment for another and, therefore, it is necessary to draw a balance between the interests of the backward classes and the other classes. The Supreme Court has shown consciousness of this danger and, therefore, has laid down a few criteria which a classification must fulfil, viz.: (i) the basis of the classification has to be backwardness; (ii) the preferential treatment accorded to backward classes has to be reasonable and must have a rational nexus to the object in view, namely, adequate representation of the under-represented backward classes; (iii) the overall consideration of administrative efficiency should be kept in view in giving preferential treatment to the backward classes. It is obvious that in Thomas, the Court has taken a more flexible view of Art. 16(1) than had been taken by it in earlier cases. It is now clearly established that Art. 16(4) does not cover the entire field covered by Arts. 16(1) and (2) and some of the matters relating to employment in respect of which equality of opportunity is guaranteed by Arts. 16(1) and (2) do not fall within Art. 16(4). The Thomas decision threw into the melting pot the decision in Devadasan in which the \"carry forward rule\" was called in question. Even the rule requiring that the overall limit of reservation should not exceed 50% was now sought to be diluted as this rule was characterised by Fazl Ali, J., as a rule of 'caution' rather than an 'absolute' rule. In Thomas, the Court upheld filling of 34 vacancies out of 51 by members of SCs and STs on the basis of the carry forward rule relating to Class III posts. Thomas represents a new trend--a high water mark--on the question of reservation in services for, and grant of other concessions to, the backward classes. Page 1094 (d) AFTER THOMAS In A.B.S.K. Sangh (Rly.) v. Union of India, 24 the Supreme Court again went into the question of reservation in public services vis-a-vis Art. 16. The Court upheld reservation of posts at various levels and making of various concessions in favour of the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The Court reiterated the Thomas proposition that under Art. 16(1) itself, the state may classify, \"based upon substantial differentia, groups or classes\" for recruitment to public services, and \"this process does not necessarily spell violation of Articles 14 to 16.\"25 Article 16(2) expressly forbids discrimination on the basis of 'caste'. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are not castes within the ordinary meaning of caste. These are backward human groups. There is a great divide between these persons and the rest of the community. As Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes suffer from socio-economic backward status, the fundamental right of equality of opportunity justifies categorisation of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes separately for the purpose of 'adequate representation' in the state services. This is constitutionally sanctioned in terms, as Arts. 16(4) and 46 specificate.26 The Court emphasized that equality of opportunity of employment means equality as between members of the same class of employees and not equality between members of separate and independent classes. Thus, reservation in selection posts in railways for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was held valid. The quantum of reservation (17½%) in railway services for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was held not excessive and the field of eligibility was not too unreasonable. The 'carry forward' rule for three years was held not bad. In the Devadasan case,27 the 'carry forward' rule for backward classes was struck down as it far exceeded 50%. In the instant case, under the carry forward rule, the quota for Scheduled Castes/Tribes could go up to a maximum of 66% of posts. This was upheld with the remark that figures on paper were not so important as the facts and circumstances in real life which showed that the quota was never fully filled. But this fixation was subject to the rider that, as a fact, in any particular year, there would not be a substantial increase over 50% in induction of reserved candidates. According to the Court: \"There is no fixed ceiling to reservation or preferential treatment in favour of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes though generally reservation may not be far in excess of fifty percent.\" Reservation in promotion posts based on seniority-cum-suitability as well as in non-selection posts was also held valid. If reservation in selection posts where the role of merit is functionally more relevant than in the non-selection posts is valid, then reservation in non-selection posts is a fortiori valid. The Court sounded a warning regarding backward classes outside the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.",

    "content": "reservation in selection posts where the role of merit is functionally more relevant than in the non-selection posts is valid, then reservation in non-selection posts is a fortiori valid. The Court sounded a warning regarding backward classes outside the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Such classes cannot bypass Art. 16(2) save where any substantial cultural and economic disparity stares at society. In the words of the Court: \"The dubious obssession with 'backwardness' and the politicking with castes labelled backward classes may, on an appropriate occasion, demand judicial examination. The politics of power cannot sabotage the principles of one man, one value.\"28 In A.B.S.K. Sangh, the Court took the actual facts, rather than the paper rules, into consideration. As a fact, the Court found that the actual intake of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes against vacancies reserved for them in recruitment and promotion categories in the railways had been slow and painful. The Court also administered a warning with respect to Art. 16(4). It observed: \"The success of state action under Art. 16(4) consists in the speed with which result oriented reservation withers away as no longer a need, not in the ever widening and everlasting operation of an exception [ Art. 16(4)] as if it were a super-fundamental right to continue backwardness all the time. To lend immortality to the reservation policy is to defeat its raison d'etre; to politicise this provision for communal support and party ends is to subvert the solemn undertaking of Art. 16(1), to casteify 'reservation' even beyond the dismal groups of backward most people, euphemistically described as scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, is to run a grave constitutional risk. Caste, ipso facto, is not class in a secular State.\" Whether or not reserved vacancies would be deserved or not is a matter primarily for the government to decide. De-reservation could be resorted to only when it is not reasonably possible within the contemplation Page 1095 of the law to fill the reserved vacancies.29 (e) SINGLE POST : NO RESERVATION It has been ruled by the Supreme Court in Chakradhar Paswan v. State of Bihar, 30 that where there is only one post in the cadre, \"there can be no reservation for the backward classes (ST, SC, and OBC) with reference to that post either for recruitment at the initial stage or filling up a future vacancy in respect of that post. A reservation which would come under Art. 16(4), pre-supposes the availability of at least more than one post in that cadre.' According to Devadasan, no reservation could be made under Art. 16(4) so as to create a monopoly. Otherwise, the guarantee of equal opportunity contained in Arts. 16(1) and 16(2) would be rendered wholly meaningless and illusory. A single promotional post cannot also be reserved.31 The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court has upheld this principle and has observed in Post-Graduate Institute of Medcial Edcuation and Research, Chandigarh v. Faculty Association :32 \"In a single post cadre, reservation at any point of time on account of rotation or roster is bound to bring about a situation where such single post in the cadre will be kept reserved exclusively for the members of the backward classes and in total exclusion of the general members of the public. Such total exclusion of general members of the public and cent per cent reservation for the backward classes is not permitted within the constitutional framework.\" Hence, until there is plurality of posts in a cadre, the question of reservation does not arise.33 The Court has emphasized: \" Articles 14, 15 and 16 including Arts. 16(4), 16(4A) must be applied in such a manner so that the balance is struck in the matter of appointments by creating reasonable opportunities for the reserved classes and also for the other members of the community who do not belong to reserved classes.\"34 The Court has further observed in this regard: \"It cannot, however, be lost sight of that in the anxiety for such reservation for the backward classes, a situation should not be brought by which the chance of appointment is completely taken away so far as the members of other segments of the society are concerned by making such single post cent per cent reserved for the reserved categories to the exclusion of other members of the community even when such member is senior in service and is otherwise more meritorious.\"35 Adequate reservation does not mean proportional representation. Thus when or rule has been inserted mechanically without taking into consideration the prerequisites for making such a provision as required under Article 16(4-A) of the Constitution of India.36 This proposition has since been reiterated by the Court in S.R. Murthy v. State of Karnataka .37 F. WHAT ARE BACKWARD CLASSES? In K.C. Vasanth Kumar v. State of Karnataka, 38 the Supreme Court had an occasion to consider the question of characterising backward classes. The Karnataka Government wanted to appoint a commission to go into this question and the Government requested the Court to lay down guidelines for the commission in the discharge of its task. However, the judges expressed a diversity of views on this complex question. Five Judges participating in the decision wrote five separate opinions. According to Chandrachud, C.J., two tests should be conjunctively applied for identifying backward classes: one, they should be comparable to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the matter of their backwardness; and, two, they should satisfy the means test, that is to say, the test of economic backwardness, laid down by the State Government in the context of the prevailing economic conditions.39 Desai, J., was against 'caste' being regarded as a major determinant of backwardness. He argued, \"If State patronage for preferred treatment accepts caste as the only insignia for determining social and educational backwardness, the danger looms large that this approach alone would legitimise and perpetuate caste system which contradicts secular principles and also run against Art. 16(2).",

    "content": "argued, \"If State patronage for preferred treatment accepts caste as the only insignia for determining social and educational backwardness, the danger looms large that this approach alone would legitimise and perpetuate caste system which contradicts secular principles and also run against Art. 16(2). Also, caste based reservation Page 1096 had been usurped by the economically well-placed section in the same caste\". According to Desai, J., the only criterion which can be realistically devised is the one of economic backwardness.\"40 Adoption of an economic criterion would translate into reality two constitutional goals: one, to strike at the perpetuation of the caste stratification of the Indian society and to take a firm step towards establishing a casteless society; and, two, to progressively eliminate poverty.41 According to Chinnappa Reddy, J., \"poverty, caste, occupation and habitation are the principal factors contributing to social backwardness\". As regards caste, his view was that the caste-system has firm links with economic power and that \"caste is the primary index of social backwardness, so that social backwardness is often readily identifiable with reference to a person's caste.\"42 According to Sen, J.: \"The predominant and the only factor for making special provisions under Art. 15(4) or for reservation of posts and appointments under Art. 16(4) should be poverty, and caste or a sub-caste or a group should be used only for purposes of identification of persons comparable to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes\". Venkataramiah, J., stressed upon the relevance of caste factor as an index of backwardness. According to him, the expression 'backward classes' can only refer to certain castes, races, tribes or communities or parts thereof other than Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Anglo-Indian community, which are backward', and \"caste or community is an important relevant factor in determining social and educational backwardness\". He, however, suggested caste-cum-means test as a 'rational test' to identify backward people for purposes of Arts. 15(4) and 16(4) for all members of a caste need not be treated as backward. The only points on which there appears to be a unanimity of views are: 'caste' cannot be the sole determinant of backwardness, but it is not an irrelevant test either and can be taken into account along with certain other factors. Also, backwardness is something comparable to the position of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Poverty is also a relevant factor to determine backwardness. In Vasanth Kumar,43 it was emphasized that the doctrine of protective discrimination embodied in Arts. 15(4) and 16(4) and the mandate of Art. 29(2)44 were subject to the requirements of Art. 33545 and could not be stretched beyond a particular limit. The Court sounded a caution:46 \"The State's objective of bringing about and maintaining social justice must be achieved reasonably having regard to the interests of all. Irrational and unreasonable moves by the State will slowly but tear apart the fabric of society. It is primarily the duty and function of the State to inject moderation into the decisions taken under Arts. 15(4) and 16(4), because justice lives in the hearts of men and a growing sense of injustice and reverse discrimination, fuelled by unwise state action, will destroy, not advance, social justice. If the state contravenes the constitutional mandates of Art. 16(1) and Art. 335 this Court will of course have to perform its duty.\" An idea was thrown in this case that there could be some services where expertise and skill are of the essence, such as, medical services which directly affect and deal with the health and life of the populace; pilots and aviation engineers where a high degree of technical knowledge and operation skill is required. Besides, \"there are other similar fields of governmental activity where professional technological, scientific or other special skill is called for\". In such services or posts under the Union or the States, suggested the Court, \"there can be no room for reservation of posts; merit alone must be the sole and decisive consideration for appointments.\"47 This idea has been further projected by the Court in Indra Sawhnay.48 The policy of reservation gives rise to some evils. This has been brought out in the following observation by Krishna Iyer, J., who was one of the most liberal Supreme Court Judges. Iyer, J., observed in State of Kerala v. N.M. Thomas :49 \"A word of sociological caution. In the light of experience, here and elsewhere the danger of 'reservation', it seems to me, is three-fold. Its benefits, by and large, are snatched away by the top creamy layer of the 'backward' caste or class, thus keeping the weakest among the weak always weak and leaving the fortunate layers to consume the whole cake. Secondly, this claim is over-played extravagantly in democracy by large and vocal groups whose burden of backwardness has been substantially lightened by the march of time and measures of better education and more opportunities of employment, but wish to wear the \"weaker section\" label as a means to score over their near-equals formally categorised as the upper brackets. Lastly, a lasting solution to the problem comes only from improvement of social environment, added educational facilities and cross fertilisation of castes by inter-caste and inter-class Page 1097 marriages....\" The ideas thrown out in the above quotation have been further projected by the Supreme Court in Indra Sawhney.50 G. THE MANDAL COMMISSION CASE : INDRA SAWHNEY V. INDIA Indra Sawhney v. Union of India, 51 known as the Mandal Commission case, is a very significant pronouncement of the Supreme Court on the question of reservation of posts for backward classes. The Court has dealt with this question in a very exhaustive manner. The Mandal Commission was appointed by the Government of India in terms of Art.",

    "content": "Court has dealt with this question in a very exhaustive manner. The Mandal Commission was appointed by the Government of India in terms of Art. 340 of the Constitution in 1979 to investigate the conditions of socially and educationally backward classes.52 One of the major recommendations made by the Commission was that, besides the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs), for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) which constitute nearly 52% component of the population, 27% government jobs be reserved so that the total reservation for all, SCs, STs and OBCs, amounts to 50%. No action was taken on the basis of the Mandal Report for long after it was submitted, except that it was discussed in the Houses of Parliament twice, once in 1982 and again in 1983. On Aug. 13, 1990, the V.P. Singh Government at the centre issued an office memorandum accepting the Mandal Commission recommendation and announcing 27% reservation for the socially and educationally backward classes in vacancies in civil posts and services under the Government of India. This memorandum led to widespread disturbances in the country. In 1991, the Narasimha Rao Government modified the above memorandum in two respects: one, the poorer sections among the backward classes would get preference over the other sections; two, 10% vacancies would be reserved for other \"economically backward sections\" of the people who were not covered by any existing reservation scheme. Ultimately, the constitutional validity of the memorandum came to be questioned in the Supreme Court through several writ petitions. The question of constitutional validity of the memorandum was considered by a Bench of 9 Judges. Six opinions were delivered. The leading opinion was delivered by Jeevan Reddy, J., on behalf of himself, Kania, C.J., Venkatachaliah, and Ahmadi, JJ. Two judges, Pandian and Sawant, JJ., in separate opinions concurred with Reddy, J. Three judges, Thommen, Kuldip Singh and Sahai, JJ., in separate opinions dissented from Reddy, J., on several points. After referring to the previous decisions of the Supreme Court on Arts. 15 and 16,53 and also after taking note of some of the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court on racial discrimination, Reddy, J., in his elaborate judgment answered the several questions which emerged in the instant case. Some of the significant points emerging from Reddy, J.'s opinion are noted below: 1. A measure of the nature contemplated by Art. 16(4) can be provided not only by the Parliament/Legislature but also by the executive through administrative instructions in respect of Central/State services and by the local bodies and 'other authorities' as contemplated by Art. 12, in respect of their services. 2. The provision made by the executive under Art. 16(4) becomes effective and enforceable by itself without its being enacted into a law made by a legislature.54 3. The Court has reiterated the view, expressed by it earlier in Thomas,55 that Art. 16(1) permits classification for ensuring attainment of equality of opportunity assured by Art. 16(1) itself. Art. 16(1) is a facet of Art. 14. Just as Art. 14 permits reasonable classification so does Art. 16(1). A classification may involve reservation of seats or vacancies, as the case may be. In other words, under Art. 16(1), appointments and/or posts can be reserved in favour of a class. Article 16(4) is not an exception to Art. 16(1), but only an instance of classification implicit and permitted by Page 1098 Art. 16(1). Even without Art. 16(4), the State could have classified \"backward class of citizens\" in a separate category for special treatment in the nature of reservation of posts/appointments in government services. Art. 16(4) merely puts the matter beyond any shadow of doubt in specific terms. 4. Art. 16(4) permits reservation in favour of any \"backward classes of citizens\". Backward classes having been classified by the Constitution itself as a class deserving special treatment, and the Constitution having itself specified the nature of special treatment, it should be presumed that no further classification or special treatment is permissible in their favour apart from or outside of Art. 16(4). Article 16(4) is exhaustive of the provisions that can be made in favour of the backward classes in the matter of employment. No reservations can be provided outside Art. 16(4) in favour of backward classes though it may not be exhaustive of the very concept of reservation. Reservations for other classes can be provided under Cl. 16(1). If for backward classes, reservations are made both under Clause (4) as well as Cl. (1), then \"the vacancies available for free competition as well as reserved categories would be correspondingly whittled down and that is not a reasonable thing to do\". In one sense, the Court has given a broad interpretation to Art. 16(4). The Court has broadly interpreted the word 'reservation\" therein. \"Reservation\" does not mean \"reservation simpliciter\" but takes in \"other forms of special provisions like preferences, concessions and exemptions.\" \"Reservation is the highest form of special provision\" while \"preference, concession and exemption are lesser forms\", and the former includes the latter. Thus, the Court has observed: \"The Constitutional scheme and context of Article 16(4) induces us to take the view that larger concept of reservations takes within its sweep all supplemental and ancillary provisions as also lesser types of special provisions like exemptions concessions and relaxations, consistent no doubt with the requirement of maintenance of efficiency of administration--the admonition of Art. 335.\"56 This means that all supplemental and ancillary provisions to ensure full availment of provisions for reservations can be provided as part of reservation itself under Art. 16(4) and there is no need to fall back upon Art. 16(1) for this purpose as was done in Thomas.57 In this sense, Art. 16(4) is exhaustive of the special provisions that can be made in favour of the backward classes.",

    "content": "and there is no need to fall back upon Art. 16(1) for this purpose as was done in Thomas.57 In this sense, Art. 16(4) is exhaustive of the special provisions that can be made in favour of the backward classes. The Court has observed in this regard: \"Backward classes having been classified by the Constitution itself as a class deserving special treatment and the Constitution having itself specified the nature of special treatment, it should be presumed that no further classification or special treatment is permissible in their favour apart from or outside of clause (4) of Art. 16.\"58 5. Even under Art. 16(1), reservations cannot be made on the basis of economic criterion alone. 6. What is the meaning of the expression \"backward class of citizens\" used in Art. 16(4)? What does the expression signify and how should such classes be identified? The accent of Art. 16(4) is on social backwardness. From a review of the previous case-law in the area, the Court has concluded that the judicial opinions emphasize the integral connection between caste, occupation, poverty and social backwardness. Social, educational and economic backwardness are closely intertwined in the Indian context. As regards identification of backward classes, caste may be used as a criterion because caste often is a social class in India. But caste cannot be the sole criterion for reservation. Reservation is not being made under Art. 16(4) in favour of a caste but a backward class. Once a caste satisfies the criteria of backwardness, it becomes a backward class for purposes of Art. 16(4). \"Besides castes (whether found among the Hindus or others) there may be other communities, groups, classes and denominations which may qualify as backward class of citizens. Reddy, J., has observed in this connection:59 \"....... the classification is not on the basis of the caste but on the ground that that caste is found to be a backward class not adequately represented in the services of the State.\" Page 1099 Among the non-Hindus, there are several occupational groups, sects and denominations which, for historical reasons, are socially backward. They too represent backward social collectivities for the purposes of Art. 16(4). 7. Backwardness under Art. 16(4) need not be social as well as educational as is the case under Art. 15(4).60 Art. 16(4) does not contain the qualifying words \"socially and educationally\" as does Art. 15(4). It is not correct to say that \"backward class of citizens\" in Art. 16(4) are the same as the \"socially and educationally backward classes\" in Art. 15(4). \"Saying so would mean and imply reading a limitation into a beneficial provision like Art. 16(4).\" Backwardness contemplated by Art. 16(4) is mainly social backwardness. A backward class cannot be identified only and exclusively with reference to economic criterion. A backward class may, however, be identified on the basis of occupation-cum-income without any reference to caste. There is no constitutional bar in the State categorising the backward classes as 'backward' and 'more backward'. 8. The Court has left the task of actually identifying backward classes to the commission/authority to be appointed by the Government. This body would evolve a proper and relevant criteria and test the several groups, castes, classes and sections of people against that criteria. (See point 20 below). 9. A very important recommendation made by the Court is that the \"creamy layer\", the socially advanced members of a backward class, should be excluded from the benefit of reservation. Such exclusion would benefit the truly backward people and, thus, more appropriately serve the purpose of Art. 16(4). But the real difficulty is how and where to draw the line? \"For, while drawing the line, it should be ensured that it does not result in taking away with one hand what is given by the other.\" Reddy, J., has opined that the basis of exclusion should not merely be economic, unless, of course, \"the economic advancement is so high that it necessarily means social advancement\". There are however certain positions, the occupants of which can be treated as \"socially advanced\" without any further inquiry. Thus, when a member of a designated backward class becomes a member of IAS or IPS or any other All India Service, his status in society rises; he is no longer socially disadvantaged. His children get full opportunity to realise their potential. They are in no way handicapped in the race of life. His salary is also such that he is above want. It is but logical that in such a situation, his children are not given the benefit of reservation. For giving them benefit of reservation, other disadvantaged members of that backward class may be deprived of that benefit. However, instead of itself laying down finally the test to identify the 'creamy layer', the Court has directed the Government to specify the basis of exclusion-- whether on the basis of income, extent of holding or otherwise. This ruling aims at ensuring that the benefit of reservation reaches the proper and the weakest section of the backward class. For the idea of excluding the 'creamy layer' of a backward class from the benefit of reservation, reference may be made to the opinion of Krishna Iyer, J., in Thomas.61 10. Not only should a class be a backward class for meriting reservations, it should also be inadequately represented in the services under the state. This matter lies within the subjective satisfaction of the State under Art. 16(4). However, there must be some material upon the basis of which the opinion is formed by the state. 11. The total reservation cannot exceed 50% in any one year. Art. 16(4) speaks of 'adequate representation' and not 'proportional representation'. The power under Art. 16(4) must be exercised in a fair manner and within reasonable limits. Therefore, reservation under Art. 16(4) should not exceed 50% of the appointments or posts \"barring certain extraordinary situations\" as explained hereafter.",

The power under Art. 16(4) must be exercised in a fair manner and within reasonable limits. Therefore, reservation under Art. 16(4) should not exceed 50% of the appointments or posts \"barring certain extraordinary situations\" as explained hereafter. Accordingly, 27% reservation in favour of backward classes together with reservation in favour of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, comes to a total of 49.5%. 12. The extraordinary situations meriting exceptions from the 50% rule have been explained thus by Reddy, J.:62 Page 1100 \"While 50% shall be the rule, it is necessary not to put out of consideration certain extraordinary situations inherent in the great diversity of this country and the people. It might happen that in far-flung and remote areas the population inhabiting those areas might, on account of their being out of the mainstream of national life and in view of conditions peculiar to and characteristical to them, need to be treated in a different way, some relaxation in this strict rule may become imperative. In doing so, extreme caution is to be exercised and a special case made out.\" 13. Further, if a member belonging to, say, a Scheduled Caste gets selected in the open competition on the basis of his own merit, he will not be counted against the quota reserved for the Scheduled Castes; he will be treated as open competition candidate.63 14. The Court has divided the total reservation of 50% into \"vertical\" and \"horizontal\" reservations. The reservation in favour of S/C, S/T and other backward classes (OBC) under Art. 16(4) may be called vertical reservation whereas reservation made in favour of physically handicapped [under Art. 16(1)] can be referred to as horizontal reservation. Horizontal reservations cut across the vertical reservations what is called interlocking reservations. To be more precise, suppose 3% of the vacancies are reserved for physicially handicapped persons. This reservation is relatable to Art. 16(1). The persons selected against this quota will be placed in the appropriate category, i.e. if he belongs to the S/C category, he will be placed in that quota by making necessary adjustments; similarly, if he belongs to the open competition category, he will be placed in that category by making necessary adjustments. Even after providing for those horizontal reservations, the over-all percentage of reservations in favour of Backward class of citizen \"remain and should remain the same\". 15. A year is to be taken as a unit for the purposes of applying the 50% rule. The Court has now overruled the Devadasan case64 which ruled out the 'carry forward' rule. Thus, reserved posts remaining unfilled in one year may be carried forward to the next year but subject to the over-all limit that over-all reservation in any one year ought not to be more than 50%. 16. A significant point made by the Court is not to apply the rule of reservation to promotions. Under Art. 16(4), reservation is permissible only at the stage of entry into the State service, i.e. only at the initial stage of direct recruitment and not at the subsequent promotional stage. The Court has now disagreed with the proposition that Art. 16(4) \"contemplates or permits reservation in promotions as well\". The Court has reached this conclusion as a result of the combined reading of Art. 16(4) and Art. 335.65 Reddy, J., has observed on this point:66 \"While it is certainly just to say that a handicap should be given to backward class of citizens at the stage of initial appointment, it would be a serious and unacceptable inroad into the rule of equality of opportunity to say that such a handicap should be provided at every stage of promotion throughout their career. That would mean creation of a permanent separate category apart from the mainstream--a vertical division of the administrative apparatus... All this is bound to affect the efficiency of administration... At the initial stage of recruitment reservation can be made in favour of backward class of citizens but once they enter the service, efficiency of administration demands that these members too compete with others and earn promotion like all others; ....They are expected to operate on equal footing with others...\" Thus, the Court now overruled Rangachari67 which had held the field for the last thirty years. To soften the adverse impact of the new ruling, the Court directed that it would be operative only prospectively and wherever reservations had been provided in promotions, it would continue for a period of five years.68 The Court has also ruled that \"it would not be impermissible for the state to extend concessions and relaxations to members of reserved categories in the matter of promotion without compromising the efficiency of the administration\". 17. For the reserved category in service, minimum standards can be prescribed. In fact, Art. 335 demands that some such standards be prescribed. In the words of REDDY, J.;69 \"It may be permissible for the Government to prescribe a reasonable lower standard for Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes/Backward Classes--consistent with the requirements of efficiency of administration--it would not be permissible not to prescribe any such minimum standard at all. While prescribing the lower minimum standard for reserved Page 1101 category, the nature of duties attached to the post and the interest of the general public also should be kept in mind.\" 18. For certain services and certain posts, it may not be advisable to apply the rule of reservation. These are posts where merit alone counts.",

    "content": "are posts where merit alone counts. The Court has included the following posts in this category: (i) Defence services including all technical posts therein but excluding civil posts; (ii) All technical posts in establishments engaged in Research and Development including those connected with atomic energy and space and establishments engaged in production of defence equipment; (iii) Teaching posts of Professors--and above, if any; (iv) Posts in super-specialities in Medicine, engineering and other scientific and technical subjects; (v) Posts of pilots (and co-pilots) in Indian Airlines and Air India. These are some of the posts mentioned. The above list is only illustrative and not exhaustive. It has been left to the Government of India \"to consider and specify the service and posts to which the rule of reservation shall not apply\". Justifying exclusion of certain posts from the rule of reservation, Reddy, J., has observed:70 \"We may point out that the services/posts enumerated above, on account of their nature and duties attached, are such as call for highest level of intelligence, skill and excellence. Some of them are second level and third level posts in the ascending order. Hence, they form a category apart. Reservation therein may not be consistent with \"efficiency of administration\" contemplated by Art. 335.\" 19. It is open to the Government to notify which classes among the several designated OBCs are more backward and apportion reserved vacancies/posts among 'backward' and more 'backward'. 20. The Court has rejected the reservation of 10% posts (made by the Narasimha Rao Government) in favour of \"other economically backward sections of the people who are not covered by any existing schemes of reservations.\" Such a category cannot be related to Art. 16(4). If at all, it can be related to Art. 16(1). Even so, the Court could not sustain it. Reservation of 10% vacancies among open competition candidates on the basis of income/property-holding means exclusion of those who are above the demarcating line from those 10% seats. It is not permissible to debar a citizen from being considered for appointment to an office under the state solely on the basis of his income or property-holding. Any such bar would be inconsistent with the guarantee of equal opportunity held out by Art. 16(1). 21. The Court has directed that there ought to be established a permanent body--commission or tribunal, both at the Centre and in each State, which can look into the complaints of wrong inclusion or non-inclusion of groups, classes and sections in the lists of OBCs. Such a body would go a long way in redressing genuine grievances. A body of this type can be created under Art. 16(4) itself. Persons aggrieved can approach it for appropriate redress. 22. There should be a periodic revision of lists of OBCs so as to exclude those who have ceased to be backward or to include new classes. The above-mentioned body may be consulted in this exercise. In Indra Sawhney, the Supreme Court has taken cognizance of many complex but very momentous questions having a bearing on the future welfare and stability of the Indian society. The Supreme Court has delivered a very thoughtful, creative and exhaustive opinion dealing with various aspects of the reservation problem. Basically reservation in government services, is anti-meritocracy, because when a candidate is appointed to a reserved post, it inevitably excludes a more meritorious candidate. But reservation is now a fact of life and it will be the ruling norm for years to come. The society may find it very difficult to shed the reservation rule in the near future. But the Court's opinion has checked the system of reservation from running riot and has also mitigated some of its evils. Three positive aspects of the Supreme Court's opinion may be highlighted. One, the over-all reservation in a year is now limited to a maximum of 50%. Page 1102 Two, amongst the classes granted reservation, those who have been benefited from reservation and have thus improved their social status (called the 'creamy layer' by the Court), should not be allowed to benefit from reservation over and over again. This means that the benefit of reservation should not be misappropriated by the upper crust but that the benefit of reservation should be allowed to filter down to the lowliest so that they may benefit from reservation to improve their position. This proposition raises the ticklish question of finding suitable socio-economic tests to identify the creamy layer among the backward classes. The Court admits that identifying the elite classes may not be an easy exercise. Accordingly, the Court has left the task of chalking out the criteria for the purpose to the government concerned. However, the Court has given one clear indication of its thinking on this issue. The Court has said that if a member of a backward family becomes a member of IAS, IPS or any other All-India Service, his social status rises; he is no longer socially disadvantaged. This means that, in effect, a family can avail of the reservation only once. Three, an element of merit has now been introduced into the scheme of reservation. This has been done in several ways, e.g.: (a) promotions are to be merit-based and are to be excluded from the reservation rule; (b) certain posts are to be excluded from the reservation rule and recruitment to such posts is to be merit-based; (c) minimum standards have to be laid down for recruitment to the reserved posts. In fact, the Court has insisted that some minimum standards must be laid down even though the same may be lower than the standards laid down for the non-reserved posts. (a) AFTERINDRA SAWHNEY The Court has not been able to completely eliminate the caste factor in identifying the backward classes. However, the Court has sought to keep the caste factor within limits. Caste can be one of the factors, but not the sole factor, to assess backwardness. Reservation has become the bane of the contemporary Indian life.",

However, the Court has sought to keep the caste factor within limits. Caste can be one of the factors, but not the sole factor, to assess backwardness. Reservation has become the bane of the contemporary Indian life. More and more sections of the society are demanding reservation for themselves in government services. The politicians are also vying among themselves for demanding reservations to all and sundry groups whether deserved or not. Needless to say, reservation is inequitable insofar as a meritorious candidate may have to be passed over in favour of a much less meritorious candidate in the reserved category. Reservation normally implies a separate quota which is reserved for a special category of persons. Within that category, appointments to the reserved posts may be made in the order of merit. However, the category for whose benefit reservation is provided is not required to compete on equal terms with the open category. Their selection and appointment to the reserved posts is made independently on their inter se merit and not as compared with the merit of candidates in the open category. The very purpose of reservation is to protect the weak category against competition from the general category candidates. As the Supreme Court has explained in Indra Sawhney, \" The very idea of reservation implies selection of a less meritorious person.\" The only justification for reservation is social justice. It is a constitutionally recognised method of overcoming backwardness. This may adversely affect efficiency in administration. But, for the present, the system of reservation has to be accepted as necessary. However, while accepting reservation upto a point as a present day politico-sociolo-gical necessity, it does not mean that it must not be kept within strict limits. The defects of the system of reservation ought not to be minimised as far as possible. The Supreme Court's opinion in Indra Sawhney makes a signal contribution to this end. For example, there should be prescribed some minimum qualifications for the candidates of the reserved categories. Also, the list of services where merit will prevail may be enlarged. Above all, it seems to be essential that reservation for more than 50% ought to be declared unconstitutional as adversely affecting the 'basic' feature of the constitutions, viz., equality, so that reservation may not be increased beyond 50% even by a constitutional amendment. This is necessary to contain the growing demand of politicians for more and more reservation in Page 1103 favour of groups they seek to represent. The reservation should be made on the basis of quantifiable data showing backwardness of the class and inadequacy of representation of that class in public employment. The Court appears to have introduced the principle of proportionality by saying that \"even if the State has compelling reasons ... the State will have to see that its reservation provision does not lead to excessiveness so as to breach the ceiling limit of 50% or obliterate the creamy layer or extend the reservation indefinitely.\"71 What is needed for the future socio-economic development of the nation, as a whole, is progressively lessening, not increasing, reservation, so that ultimately meritocracy may have some chance to prevail over mediocrity. Art. 335 lays down the ideal of \"efficiency of administration\". It is suggested that Art. 335 should be treated not only as a \"directive principle\" but as an \"operative and binding constitutional principle\" so that any move towards reservation, and any administrative decision concerning reservation, should be assessed by the Court on the touchstone laid down in Art. 335, viz., \"efficiency of administration\".72 Art. 335 refers only to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. There is no specific provision insisting on the need for maintenance of \"efficiency of administration\" so far as the backward classes are concerned. But the Supreme Court has insisted in Indra Sawhney II73 that the principle of efficiency of administration is equally paramount and is implied in Arts. 14 and 16 of the Constitution so far as backward classes are concerned. To hold otherwise would not only be irrational but even discriminatory between the two classes of backward citizens, viz., Scheduled Castes/Sche-duled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. Therefore, considerations underlying Art. 335 prevail even while making provisions in favour of Other Backward Classes under Art. 16(4). \"Reservation even for Backward Classes can be made only if it will not undermine the efficiency of the administration in the particular department\".74 As the Supreme Court has observed in Ajit Singh v. State of Punjab (II) :75 \"It is necessary to see that the rule of adequate representation in Art. 16(4) for the Backward Classes....do not adversely affect the efficiency in administration... Thus, in the matter of due representation in services for Backward Classes.... maintenance of efficiency in administration is of paramount importance\". The Court has also suggested a periodic review of the list of backward classes. The Court has opined that inclusion of castes in the list of backward classes should not be done without adequate relevant data. Forward castes should not get included in this list. The process of periodic review of the list of OBCs may lead to the exclusion of a backward class if it ceases to be socially backward or if it is adequately represented in the services.",

    "content": "maxim \"Once backward, always backward is not acceptable.\"76 Even policy matters have to be tested on the touchstone of arbitrariness and to be struck down if it is held to be discriminatory or arbitrary.77 The Supreme Court has explained that the effect of Indra Sawhney78 in the determination of the question of categorisation of the backward classes did not provide for any mandatory requirement for adducing empirical evidence or materials to show that the community in question was adequately represented before taking away of benefit of reservation.79 The Court has also said that sub-division of class is not unconstitutional and it was open to the state to categorize backward classes as backward and more backward. There is no Constitutional bar to a State categorising the backward classes as backward and more backward class. The actions of the State Government while including or excluding classes to the list is subject to judicial review. (b) CREAMY LAYER In the Mandal case, the Supreme Court has clearly and authoritatively laid down that the \"socially\" advanced members of a backward class, the \"creamy layer\", has to be excluded from the backward class and the benefit of reservation under Art. 16(4) can only be given to the \"class\" which remains after the exclusion of the 'creamy layer'. This would more appropriately serve the purpose and object of Art. 16(4). The reason underlying this approach is that an effort be made so that the most deserving section of the backward class is benefited by reservations under Art. 16(4). At present, the benefits of job reservations are mostly chewed up by the more effluent sections of the backward class and the poorer and the really Page 1104 backward sections among them keep on getting poorer and more backward. The jobs are few in comparison to the population of the backward classes and it is not possible to give them adequate representation in state services. Therefore, it is necessary that the benefit of reservation should reach the poorer and the weakest section of the backward class. In his opinion in Indra Sawhney, Jeevan Reddy, J., has emphasized that upon the member of a backward class reaching an \"advanced social level or status\", he would no longer belong to the backward class and would have to be weeded out. The Court has opined that exclusion of creamy layer, i.e., socially advanced members, will make the class a truly backward class and would more appropriately serve the purpose and object of Art. 16(4). Jeevan Reddy, J., has stated that there are sections among the backward classes who are highly advanced socially and educationally, and they constitute the forward section of the community. These advanced sections do not belong to the true backward class. \"After excluding them alone, would the class be a compact class. In fact, such exclusion benefits the truly backward.\" A line has to be drawn between the forward in the backward class and the rest of the backward. If the creamy layer is not excluded, the truly disadvantaged members of the backward class to which they belong will be deprived of the benefits of reservation. If the creamy layer among backward classes were given same benefits as backward classes, it will amount to treating unequals equally which amounts to the violation of the equality clause. According to Jeevan Reddy, J., the exclusion of the creamy layer must be on the basis of social advancement and not on the basis of economic interest alone. It is difficult to draw a line where a person belonging to the backward class ceases to be so and becomes part of the 'creamy layer'. It is not possible to lay down the criteria exhaustively. But Jeevan Reddy, J., specifically laid down one criterion. There are certain positions the occupants of which can be treated as socially advanced without any further inquiry. The Court has specifically declared that the children of the I.A.S., I.P.S., or any other All India Services in the Backward Classes constitute the creamy layer and this is true without further inquiry. The social status of any such officer rises and he is no longer socially disadvantaged. His children get full opportunity to realise their potential. They are in no way handicapped in the area of life. It is but logical that his children be not given the benefit of reservation for by giving them the benefit of reservation other disadvantaged members of that backward class may be deprived of the benefit. In other cases, in a big country like India, norms may differ from State to State or from region to region. Accordingly, the Court has directed that a body be constituted both at the Centre and at the State level to identify the creamy layer within the backward classes. The Supreme Court has observed in this connection: \"The backward class under Art. 16(4) means the class which has no element of \"creamy layer\" in it. It is mandatory under Art. 16(4)--as interpreted by this Court--that the State must identify the 'creamy layer' in a backward class and thereafter by excluding the 'creamy layer' extend the benefit of reservation to the 'class' which remains after such exclusion.\" There has been a good deal of resistance on the part of the States to the idea of excluding the creamy layer. The States have adopted various devices to continue to confer benefits of reservation on the creamy layer. The reason may be that the policy-making power vests in the creamy layer and such persons do not like to curtail their own privileges. This is illustrated by the following two cases. In Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. State of Bihar, 80 the Supreme Court has assessed the validity of unrealistically high levels of income or holding of other conditions prescribed by the Legislatures of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar as criteria to identify the creamy layer. For example, while the Supreme Court in the Mandal case has categorically said that the Children of IAS or IPS, etc.",

    "content": "example, while the Supreme Court in the Mandal case has categorically said that the Children of IAS or IPS, etc. without anything more could not avail the benefit of reservation, in the scheme drawn in UP and Bihar, a few more conditions were added for falling in the creamy layer, such as, he/she should be getting a salary of Rs. 10,000/- p.m. or more; the wife or husband to be a graduate and owning a house in an urban area. Or, if a professional doctor, surgeon, lawyer, architect, etc., he should be having an income not less than Rs. 10 lakhs, his/her spouse is a graduate and having Page 1105 family property worth Rs. 20 lakhs. Similar conditions were added in case of others, such as, traders, artisans, etc. The Supreme Court has quashed these conditions as discriminatory. The Court has ruled that these conditions laid down by the two States have no 'nexus' with the object sought to be achieved. The criteria laid down by the two States to identify the creamy layer are violative of Art. 16(4), wholly arbitrary, violative of Art. 14, and against the law laid down by the Supreme Court in the Mandal case, where the Court has expressed the view that a member of the All India Service without anything more ought to be regarded as belonging to the \"creamy layer\". The Court has observed in this regard:81 \"The backward class under Article 16(4) means the class which has no element of 'creamy layer' in it. It is mandatory under Art. 16(4)--as interpreted by this Court--that the state must identify the 'creamy layer' in a backward class and thereafter, by excluding the 'creamy layer' extend the benefit of reservation to the 'class' which remains after such exclusion. This Court has laid down, clear and easy to follow guidelines for the identification of 'creamy layer'. The States of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have acted wholly arbitrary and in utter violation of the law laid down by this Court in Mandal case. It is difficult to accept that in India where the per capita national income is Rs. 6929 (1993-94), a person who is a member of the IAS and a professional who is earning less than Rs. 10 lakhs per annum is socially and educationally backward. We are of the view that the criteria laid down by the States of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, for identifying the 'creamy layer' on the face of it is arbitrary and has to be rejected.\" The Kerala Legislature passed an Act in 1995 declaring that there was no creamy layer in the State of Kerala. The validity of the State Act was challenged in the Supreme Court. In Indra Sawhney v. Union of India (II), 82 the Court has explained further the rationale underlying the rule of exclusion of 'creamy-layer'. As the 'creamy layer' is not entitled to the benefits of reservation, non-exclusion thereof will be discrimination and violation of Arts. 14 and 16 in as much as unequals cannot be treated as equals, i.e., equal to the rest of the backward class. Therefore, any executive or legislative action refusing to exclude the creamy layer from the benefits of reservation will amount to violation of Arts. 14, 16(1) and 16(4). In the instant case, the Court has declared the Kerala Act declaring that there are no socially advanced sections in any backward class in the State as unconstitutional as being violative of Arts. 14 and 16(1). According to the Court, the Act has shut its eyes to the realities and facts; it has no factual basis. \"The declaration is a mere cloak and is unrelated to facts in existence\". The Court has emphasized that equality is the basic feature of the Constitution and neither Parliament nor any State Legislature can transgress this principle.83 Non-exclusion of creamy layer will not only be a breach of Art. 14 but even of the basic structure of the Constitution and, therefore, totally illegal.84 The Court has criticised the attitude of the State of Kerala in this matter in trenchant terms, characterising the State action as being against Rule of Law and amounting to \"deliberate violation of the directions of the Court\". The Court has observed:85 \".......... the unreasonable delay on the part of the Kerala Government and the discriminatory law made by the Kerala Legislature have been in virtual defiance of the rule of law and also an indefensible breach of the equality principle which is a basic feature of the Constitution. They are also in open violation of the judgments of this Court which are binding under Article 141 and the fundamental concept of separation of powers which has also been held to be a basic feature of the constitution. The State has already been held guilty of contempt.\" The Court has directed the State to make provision for the exclusion of the creamy layer among the backward classes in the State. Just as the Court has insisted on the exclusion of the creamy layer from the backward classes, so also the Court has insisted on the exclusion of the forward classes from the list of backward classes. The Court has again referred to this matter in Indra Sawhney II. This exclusion is necessary with a view to confer full benefits of reservation on the real backward classes. If forward classes are included in the list of backward classes, most of the benefits will be knocked away by the forward classes and the same will not reach the really backward among the backward classes. \"That will leave the truly backward, backward for ever\". The Court has emphasized that to include a forward class as a backward class will amount to treating unequals as equals and this will amount to violation of Arts. 14 and 16.",

    "content": "1106 The Court seems to have reacted to excessive affirmative action following Indra Sawhney-I.86 In Nagaraj87 a Constitution Bench pointed out that although the State was free to exercise its discretion in providing for reservation, such discretion was not unfettered but subject to limitation, namely, that there must exist compelling reasons of backwardness, inadequacy of representation in a class of posts keeping in mind the overall administrative efficiency, and that, even if the State had reasons to make reservation but the law enacted for implementing such reservation was liable to be set aside if it violated any of the substantive limits on the width of the power. (c) ART. 16(4) : A TRANSITORY PROVISION Article 16(4) is an enabling provision and confers a discretionary power on the State to make reservation in the matter of appointments in favour of backward classes of citizens which in its opinion are not adequately represented either numerically or qualitatively in services of the State. But it confers no Constitutional right upon the members of the backward classes to claim reservation. This article does not say that only such Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes which are mentioned in the Presidential Order issued under Arts. 341(1) or 342(1) for a particular State alone would be recognized as backward classes of citizens and none else. If a State or Union Territory makes a provision whereunder the benefit of reservation is extended only to such Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes which are recognized as such in relation to that State or Union Territory then such a provision would be perfectly valid. The UT of Pondicherry having adopted a policy of the Central Government whereunder all Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes, irrespective of their State are eligible for posts which are reserved for SC/ST candidates, no legal infirmity can be ascribed to such a policy and the same cannot be held to be contrary to any provision of law.88 In Preeti Sagar89 that the Constitution permits preferential treatment for historically disadvantaged groups in the context of entrenched and clearly perceived social inequalities. That is why Art. 16(4) permits reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class which is not adequately represented in the services under the State. Reservation is linked with adequate representation in the services. Reservation is thus a dynamic and flexible concept. The departure from the principle of equality of opportunity has to be constantly watched. So long as the backward group is not adequately represented in the services under the State, reservations should be made. From the above it is clear that the mechanism of reservation has been considered as a transitory measure that will enable the backward to enter and be adequately represented in the state services against the backdrop of prejudice and social discrimination. But, finally, as the social backdrop changes--and a change in the social backdrop is one of the constitutional imperatives, as the backward are able to secure adequate representation in the services, the reservations will not be required. Art. 335 enters a further caveat on reservations, viz., while considering the claims of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes as well as backward classes, for appointments, the maintenance of efficiency of administration is to be kept in sight. (d) RESERVATION IN JUDICIAL SERVICES Reference has already been made earlier to State of Bihar v. Bal Mukund Sah90 The Supreme Courtdeclared a State Act seeking to make reservation for SCs, STs and OBCs in subordinate judiciary unconstitutional, as the State enacted the Act without any consultation with the concerned High Court. The Court has insisted that Art. 16(4) must be read with Art. 335. This means that maintenance of efficiency of administration in the making of appointments to services and posts is a sine qua non before considering the case for reservation in judicial services. Further, the High Court must be consulted before enacting any such law as according to Art. 235, the High Court is entrusted with full control over subordinate judiciary. The Supreme Court has asserted that the \"independence of the judiciary\" and \"separation of powers between the Legislature, Executive and the judiciary\" are the two principles which constitute the \"basic structure of the Constitution and thus these principles cannot be violated by any law.91 H. CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS After Indra Sawhny, two Constitutional Amendments have been incorporated in Art. 16(4) to somewhat tone Page 1107 down the impact of the Supreme Court pronouncement. (a) ART. 16(4A) In Rangachari,92 the Supreme Court by majority had held that Art. 16(4) permitted reservation of posts not only at the initial stage of appointment but also included promotion to selection posts. This proposition was reiterated in several subsequent pronouncements by the Supreme Court.93 The Supreme Court had thus interpreted the term 'appointment' in Art. 16 liberally as including initial appointment as well as promotion. This position continued till the Indra Sawhney pronouncement. In Indra Sawhney, as stated above, eight out of nine Judges opined that Art. 16(4) was confined to initial appointments only and it did not permit or warrant reservations in the matter of promotion as such, as this gave rise to several untoward and inequitous results.94 The Court however permitted the existing rules in that behalf to operate for a period of five years from the date of the judgment. Thus, Rangachari decision was overruled. Since then, however, the 77th Constitutional Amendment has been brought into effect permitting reservation in promotion to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.95 The following clause [4A] has been added to Art.",

    "content": "in 1995: \"Nothing in this Article shall prevent the State from making any provision for reservation in matters of promotion to any class or classes of posts in the services under the State in favour of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes which in the opinion of the State are not adequately represented in the services under the State.\" The Constitutional Amendment was brought into effect before the expiry of the time-limit set by the Supreme Court, viz., five years from the date of the judgment for the rule permitting reservation in promotion to end. Art. 16(4A) came into force from 17-6-1995. Thus, by amending the Constitution, Parliament has removed the base as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Indra Sawhney that \"appointment\" does not include \"promotion\". Art 16(4A) thus revives the interpretation put on Art. 16 in Rangachari. Rule of reservation can now apply not only to initial recruitment but also to promotions as well where the state is of the opinion that the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are not adequately represented in promotional posts in services under the state.1 It may however be noted that Art 16(4A) permits reservation in promotion posts only for the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes but not for other Backward Classes. This means that the position taken by the Supreme Court in Indra Sawhney still prevails as regards OBCs in respect of promotion posts. No reservation can be made in promotion posts for the OBCs. The Supreme Court has emphasized that Art. 16(4A) ought to be applied in such a manner that a balance is struck in the matter of appointments by creating reasonable opportunities for the reserved classes as well as for other members of the society.2 It has also been held that Art. 16(4A) is an enabling provision. It the State makes no reservation, the High Court has no jurisdiction under Art. 226 of the Constitution to issue any direction therefor.3 (b) PROMOTION & SENIORITY Promotion of S/C and S/T employees out of turn because of the scheme of reservation gives rise to several problems, especially, pertaining to seniority of such persons over the employees belonging to the general category. The Supreme Court has sought to grapple with such problems keeping in view considerations of equity and fairness. In Union of India v. Virpal Singh Chauhan, 4 a two-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court reiterated what the Court had said in Indra Sawhney that providing reservation in promotion was not warranted by Art. 16(4). The rule of reservation in promotion factually created a very poignant and objectionable situation in Virpal. Page 1108 Of the 33 candidates being considered for promotion to 11 vacancies, all were SC/ST candidates. Not a single candidate among them belonged to the general category. The Court described the resultant situation arising out of reservation in promotion posts as follows:5 \"Not only the juniors are stealing a march over the seniors but the march is so rapid that not only erstwhile compatriots are left far behind but even the persons who were in the higher categories at the time of entry of Scheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes candidates in the service have also been left behind. Such a configuration could not certainly have been intended by the framers of the Constitution or the framers of the rules of reservation\". The Court stated in Virpal that there is no uniform or prescribed method of providing reservation. The extent and nature of reservation is a matter for the state to decide having regard to the facts and requirements of each case. It is open to a state to say that while the reservation is to be applied and the roster followed in the matter of promotions to or within a particular service, class or category, the candidate promoted earlier by virtue of the rule of reservation/roster shall not be entitled to seniority over his senior in the feeder category and that as and when a general candidate who was senior to him in the feeder category is promoted, such general candidate would regain his seniority over the reserved candidate notwithstanding that he has been promoted subsequent to the reserved candidate. There is no unconstitutionality involved in this. It is permissible for the state to so provide. In Ajit Singh Januja v. State of Punjab, 6 a three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court has gone a step ahead than Virpal. Reading Arts. 14, 16 and 335, the Supreme Court has now categorically laid down that when there arises a question to fill up a post reserved for a SC/ST candidate in a still higher grade, then a SC/ST candidate is to be promoted first, but when the question is in respect of promotion to a general category post, then the general category candidate who has been promoted later would be considered first for promotion applying either the principle of seniority cum merit or merit cum seniority. The Court has agreed with the Virpal ruling that seniority between the reserved category candidates and the general candidates in the promoted category shall continue to be governed by their panel position, i.e., with reference to their inter se seniority in the lower grade. The rule of reservation gives accelerated promotion, but it does not give the accelerated \"consequential seniority\". Explaining the rationale underlying this ruling, the Court has observed: \"If this rule and procedure is not applied then result will be that majority of the posts in the higher grade shall be held at one stage by persons who have not only entered in service on basis of reservation and roster but have excluded the general category candidates from being promoted to the posts reserved for general category candidates merely on the ground of their initial accelerated promotions. This will not be consistent with the requirement or spirit of Articles 16(4) or Article 335 of the Constitution.\"7 Accordingly, the Court ruled that the question of seniority at the promotional level must be decided according to the provisions of Arts.",

    "content": "will not be consistent with the requirement or spirit of Articles 16(4) or Article 335 of the Constitution.\"7 Accordingly, the Court ruled that the question of seniority at the promotional level must be decided according to the provisions of Arts. 14 and 16(1) and \"if any order, circular or rule provided that such reserved candidates who got promotions at roster points were to be treated as senior to the senior candidates who were promoted later, then such an order, circular or rule would be violative of Articles 14 and 16(1)\". The position, however, would be different if before the senior general candidate got his promotion under the normal rule of seniority or selection, the reserved candidate who was promoted earlier at the roster point, had got a further promotion. The Court said in Ajit Singh I, that the balance must be maintained in such a manner that there is no reverse discrimination against the general candidates and that any rule, circular or order giving seniority to the reserved candidates promoted at roster point, would be violative of Arts. 14 and 16(1) of the Constitution of India. But, then, in Jagdish Lal v. State of Haryana, 8 a three Judge Bench differed from the above rulings. The Court now argued that the normal rule of seniority ought to prevail in this area as well, viz., that the seniority rule ought to apply meaning thereby that the seniority is to be counted from the date of promotion. Ultimately, the Court reconsidered the whole matter in Ajit Singh II.9 A Constitution Bench has now overruled Jagdish Lal and has restored the view as expressed in Ajit Singh I. Page 1109 The Court has now stated that the primary purpose of Art. 16(4) is due representation of certain classes in certain posts. But, along with Art. 16(4), there are Arts. 14, 16(1) and 335 as well. Arts. 14 and 16 lay down the permissible limits of the affirmative action by way of reservation which may be taken under Arts. 16(4) and 16(4-A). While permitting reservations, Art. 14 and 16(1) also lay down certain limitations at the same time. Art. 335 ensures that the efficiency of administration is not jeopardized.10 The right to equal opportunity in the matter of promotion in the sense of a right to be \"considered\" for promotion is a Fundamental Right guaranteed by Art. 16(1). Art. 16(1) provides to every employee otherwise eligible for promotion, or who comes within the zone of consideration, a Fundamental Right to be \"considered\" for promotion. If a person satisfies the eligibility and zone criteria but is not considered for promotion, then there will be a clear infraction of his Fundamental Right to be \"considered\" for promotion, which is his personal right. Article 16(4) or 16(4A) contains no directive or command; it is only an enabling provision;11 it imposes no constitutional duty on the state and confers no Fundamental Right on any one. It is necessary to balance Art. 16(1) and Arts. 16(4) and 16(4A). The interests of the reserved classes must be balanced against the interests of other segments of society.12 The doctrine of equality of opportunity in Art. 16(1) is to be reconciled in favour of backward classes under Art. 16(4) in such a manner that Art. 16(4), while serving the cause of backward classes shall not unreasonably encroach upon the field of equality. It is necessary to strike such a balance so as to attract meritorious and talented persons to the public services. It is also necessary to ensure that the rule of adequate representation in Art. 16(4) for the backward classes and the rule of adequate representation in promotion for SC/ST under Art. 16(4-A) do not adversely affect the efficiency in administration as warranted by Art. 335. When a reserved candidate is recruited at the initial level he does not go through the same normal process of selection which is applied to a general candidate. A reserved candidate gets appointment to a post reserved for his group. He is promoted to a higher post without competing with general candidates. The normal seniority rule, viz., from the date of \"continuous officiation\" from the date of promotion applies when a candidate is promoted in the normal manner and not to the promotion of a reserved candidate. Accordingly, in Ajit Singh II, the Court has laid down the following principle to regulate the seniority of the promoted reserved candidates:13 \".... the roster-point promotees (reserved category) cannot count their seniority in the promoted category from the date of their continuous officiation in the promoted post--vis-a-vis the general candidates who were senior to them in the lower category and who were later promoted. On the other hand, the senior general candidate at the lower level, if he reaches the promotional level later but before the further promotion of the reserved candidate--he will have to be treated as senior, at the promotion level, to the reserved candidate even if the reserved candidate was earlier promoted to that level.\" The Court has ruled that Virpal and Ajit Singh I have been correctly decided but not Jagdish Lal. In M.G. Badappanavar v. State of Karnataka, 14 the Supreme Court has again confirmed its earlier ruling in Ajit Singh II and directed that the seniority lists as between the general and reserved promotees, and promotions, be reviewed in the light of the ruling in that case. The Court directed that the seniority of the general candidates be restored accordingly.

    "content": "runs as follows: \"Nothing in this Article shall prevent the State from considering any unfilled vacancies of a year which are reserved for being filled up in that year in accordance with any provision for reservation made under clause (4) or clause (4A) as a separate class of vacancies to be filled up in any succeeding year or years and such class of vacancies shall not be considered together with the vacancies of the year in which they are being filled up for determining the ceiling of fifty percent reservation on total number of vacancies of that year.\" Page 1110 The Amendment envisages that the unfilled reserved vacancies in a year are to be carried forward to subsequent years and that these vacancies are to be treated as distinct and separate from the current vacancies during any year. The rule of 50% reservation laid down by the Supreme Court is to be applied only to the normal vacancies and not to the posts of backlog of reserved vacancies. This means that the unfilled reserved vacancies are to be carried forward from year to year without any limit, and are to be filled separately from the normal vacancies. This Amendment also modifies the proposition laid down by the Supreme Court in Indra Sawhney. The Amendment does increase the employment opportunities for the S/C, S/T and OBC candidates. I. ABOLITION OF UNTOUCHABILITY Article 17 abolishes untouchability and forbids its practice in any form. The enforcement of any disability arising out of \"untouchability\" is to be an offence punishable in accordance with law. Abolition of untouchability in itself is complete and its effect is all pervading applicable to state action as well as acts or omissions by individuals, institutions or juristic body of persons.15 The main object of Art. 17 is to ban the practice of untouchability in any form. To give effect to Art. 17, Parliament enacted the Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955, prescribing punishments for practising untouchability in various forms. In 1976, the Actwas renamed as the \" Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955\". The word \"untouchability\" has not been defined either in the Constitution or in the Act, because it is not capable of any precise definition. It has however been held that the subject-mater of Art. 17 is not untouchability in its literal or grammatical sense but the \"practice as it had developed historically in this country\". Therefore, treating of persons as untouchables either temporarily or otherwise for various reasons, e.g., suffering from an epidemic or a contagious disease, or social observances associated with birth or death, or social boycott resulting from caste or other disputes do not come within the purview of Art. 17. Art. 17 is concerned with those regarded untouchables in the course of historic development.16 Thus, instigation of a social boycott of a few individuals, or their exclusion from worship, religious services or food, etc., is not within the contemplation of Art. 17.17 It is not clear whether Art. 17 would prohibit outcasting or ex-communication of a person of a higher caste from his caste.18 The State Legislature passed a law to improve the conditions of living of untouchables. Accordingly, the Act provided for acquisition of land for constructing a colony for them. It was argued against the validity of the law that the construction of a colony would not be in conformity with Art. 17. The Madras High Court rejected the argument.19 The Court stated that what Art. 17 prohibits is singling out the Harijan community for hostile treatment as a socially backward community. By no process of reasoning, could Art. 17 be held to prohibit the State from introducing a scheme for improving the condition of living of such persons. The Court also referred to Art. 15(4) in this connection.20 Parliament has also enacted the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, in order--(i) to prevent the commission of atrocities against the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes; (ii) to provide for setting up of special Courts for the trial of offences under the Act and (iii) also to provide for the relief and rehabilitation of victims of such offences. The statement of Objects and Reasons accompanying the corresponding Bill stated as follows: \"Despite various measures to improve the socio-economic conditions of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, they remain vulnerable. They are denied number of civil rights. They are subjected to various offences, indignities, humiliations and harassment. They have, in several brutal incidents, been deprived of their life and property. Serious crimes are committed against them for various historical, social and economic reasons....\"21 Page 1111 Art. 15(2) also helps in the eradication of untouchability, as no person shall, on the grounds only of \"religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them\", be denied access to shops, etc., as mentioned therein.22 An interesting point to note is that while the Fundamental Rights, generally speaking, are restrictions mainly on government activities, Arts. 17 and 15(2) protect an individual from discriminatory conduct not only on the part of the state but even on the part of private persons in certain situations. The Supreme Court has stated that whenever any Fundamental Right like Art. 17 is violated by a private individual, it is the constitutional obligation of the state to take the necessary steps for the purpose of interdicting such violation and ensuring observance of the Fundamental Right by the private individual who is transgressing the same. The state is under a constitutional obligation to see that there is no violation of the Fundamental Right of such person. Reference may also be made in this connection to Arts. 14, 21, 23, 25 and 29, discussed later.23 The Directive Principles, especially Arts.",

Reference may also be made in this connection to Arts. 14, 21, 23, 25 and 29, discussed later.23 The Directive Principles, especially Arts. 38 and 46, obligate the state to render socio-economic and political justice to Dalits and improve the quality of their life.24 \"The abolition of untouchability is the arch of the Constitution to make its preamble meaningful and to integrate the Dalits in the national mainstream\".25 J. ABOLITION OF TITLES Article 18(1) prohibits the state from conferring any 'title' except a military or academic distinction. Art. 18(2) prohibits citizens of India from accepting any title from a foreign government. A foreigner holding any office of profit or trust under the state cannot accept any title from any foreign state without the consent of the President [ Art. 18(3)]. No person holding any office of profit under the state is to accept, without the consent of the President, any present, emolument, or office of any kind from or under any foreign state [ Art. 18(4)]. It is not clear as to what would happen if a citizen accepts a title in contravention of Art. 18(2). It is open to Parliament, under its residuary powers, to make a law prescribing what should be done with regard to an individual who accepts a title contrary to the Article.26 The Supreme Court has ruled in Balaji Raghavan v. Union of India, 27 that the national awards like \"Bharat Ratna\", \"Padma Vibhushan\", etc. awarded by the Government of India, are not 'titles' within the meaning of Art. 18(1). These awards are not violative of the principles of equality as guaranteed by Arts. 14 and 18. The Court has observed in this connection:28 \"The theory of equality does not mandate that merit should not be recognized. Art. 51A of the Constitution speaks of the fundamental duties of every citizen of India. In this context, we may refer to the various clauses of Art. 51A and specifically clause (j) which exhorts every citizen \"to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity, so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement\". It is, therefore, necessary that there should be a system of awards and decorations to recognize excellence in the performance of these duties\".29 However, awards conferred by the state are not to be used as suffixes or prefixes. The Court has also suggested that the Prime Minister in consultation with the President should appoint a high level committee to lay down criteria for selection of persons for these awards. In the words of Kuldip Singh, J., \"Conferment of Padma awards without any firm guidelines and foolproof method of selection is bound to breed nepotism, favouritism, patronage and even corruption.\"30 1.

M P Jain Indian Constitutional Law/Volume 1/PART V POLITICAL AND CIVIL RIGHTS/CHAPTER XXIV Fundamental Rights (5) Six Freedoms of a Citizen CHAPTER XXIV Fundamental Rights (5) Six Freedoms of a Citizen Page 1123 A. RIGHT TO FREEDOM Clauses (a) to (g) of Art. 19(1) guarantee to the citizens of India six freedoms, viz., of 'speech and expression', 'peaceable assembly' 'association', 'free movement', 'residence', and 'practising any profession and carrying on any business'. These various freedoms are necessary not only to promote certain basic rights of the citizens but also certain democratic values in, and the oneness and unity of, the country. Art. 19 guarantees some of the basic, valued and natural rights inherent in a person. According to the Supreme Court, it is possible that a right does not find express mention in any clause of Art. 19(1) and yet it may be covered by some clause therein.1 This gives an additional dimension to Art. 19(1) in the sense that even though a right may not be explicit, it may yet be implicit, in the various clauses of Art. 19.2 It has been said that these rights are great and basic rights which are recognized and guaranteed as the natural rights, inherent in the status of a citizen of a free country but not absolute in nature and uncontrolled in operation. The scheme of Article 19 shows that a group of rights are listed as clauses (a) to (g) and are recognized as Fundamental Rights conferred on citizens. All the rights do not stand on a common pedestal but have varying dimensions and underlying philosophies. The common thread that runs throughout clauses (2) to (6) is that the operation of any existing law or the enactment by the State of any law which imposes reasonable restrictions to achieve certain objects, is saved; however, the quality and content of such law would be different by reference to each of sub clauses (a) to (g) of clause (1) of Article 19.3 Originally, Art. 19 guaranteed seven freedoms. The freedom to hold and acquire property was deleted in 1978.4 However, the freedoms guaranteed by Art. 19(1) are not absolute as no right can be. Each of these rights is liable to be controlled, curtailed and regulated to some extent by laws made by Parliament or the State Legislatures. Accordingly, clauses (2) to (6) of Art. 19 lay down the grounds and the purposes for which a legislature can impose 'reasonable restrictions' on the rights guaranteed by Arts. 19(1)(a) to (g). Article 19 confers the several freedoms on the citizens. Therefore, a municipal committee,5 deity,6 or a foreigner7 cannot invoke Art. 19. The question of citizenship of a company or a corporation has already been discussed earlier.8 Article 19 protects the six freedoms of an Indian citizen from state action, and violation of these freedoms by private conduct of an individual is not within its purview.9 Inspite of there being a general presumption in favour of constitutionality of a legislation, in a challenge laid to the validity of any legislation allegedly violating any right or freedom guaranteed by clause (1) of Art.",

    "content": "on a prima facie case of such violation having been made out, the onus would shift upon the respondent State to show that the legislation comes within the permissible limits of restrictions set out in clauses (2) to (6) of Art. 19, and that the particular restriction is reasonable. The Constitutional Court would expect the State to place before it sufficient material justifying the restriction and its reasonability. Thus the onus of proof in such cases is an ongoing shifting process to be consciously observed by the Court called upon to decide the constitutional validity of a legislation by reference to Article 19 of the Constitution.10 These rights have been advisedly set out in broad terms leaving scope for their expansion and adaptation, through interpretation, to the changing needs and evolving notions of a free society.11 Every right is coupled with a duty. Part III of the Constitution of India although confers rights, duties and restrictions are inherent thereunder. Such reasonable restrictions have been found to be contained in the provisions of Part III of the constitution of India, apart from clauses (2) to (4) and (6) of Article 19 of the Constitution of India. Thus, the right to fly the National Flag is subject to certain restrictions which can be read from chapter IV-A.12 FOREIGNERS A foreigner enjoys no rights under Art. 19. Art. 19 confers certain Fundamental Rights on the citizens and not Page 1124 on non-citizens of India.13 A foreigner can thus claim no right \"to reside and settle in India\", as mentioned in Art. 19(1)(e).14 The Government thus has an unrestricted right to expel a foreigner. As regards the right to be heard, there is no hard and fast rule about the manner in which a person concerned has to be given such an opportunity. A foreigner who came to India in 1937 on a Belgian passport engaged himself in Christian missionary work. He had been staying continuously in India since 1937. By an order dated 8-7-1987, his request for further stay in India was rejected and he was ordered to leave the country. He challenged the order through a writ petition under Art. 32 which was rejected. The Court ruled that he had not become a citizen of India under Art. 5 of the Constitution as he had not acquired his domicile in India.15 For this purpose, \"He must prove that he had formed the intention of making his permanent home in the country of residence and of continuing to reside there permanently. Residence alone, unaccompanied by this state of mind, is insufficient. \"In the instant case, there was nothing to suggest even remotely that the petitioner had formed any intention of permanently residing here.\"16 A foreigner does, however, enjoy the Fundamental Right to life and personal liberty under Art. 21.17 According to the tenor of the language of Art. 21, it is available not only to every citizen of this country, but also to a person who may not be a citizen of this country. Even those who come to India merely as tourists or in any other capacity are entitled to the protection of their lives under Art. 21.18 B. REASONABLE RESTRICTIONS: ARTS. 19(2) TO 19(6) Limitations imposed by Arts. 19(2) to 19(6) on the freedoms guaranteed by Arts. 19(1)(a) to (g) serve a twofold purpose, viz., on the one hand, they specify that these freedoms are not absolute but are subject to regulation; on the other hand, they put a limitation on the power of a legislature to restrict these freedoms. A legislature cannot restrict these freedoms beyond the requirements of Arts. 19(2) to 19(6). Three significant characteristics of clauses 19(2) to 19(6) may be noted: (1) The restrictions under them can be imposed only by or under the authority of a law; no restriction can be imposed by executive action alone without there being a law to back it up. (2) Each restriction must be reasonable. (3) A restriction must be related to the purposes mentioned in Clauses 19(2) to 19(6). There is thus a double test to adjudge the validity of a restriction: (a) whether it is reasonable; and (b) whether it is for a purpose mentioned in the clause under which the restriction is being imposed? Both these questions are to be determined finally by the Courts when a law is challenged as unconstitutional. The legislative determination of what restrictions to impose on a freedom is not final and conclusive as it is subject to judicial review. (a) TEST FOR REASONABLENESS It is difficult to give an exact definition of the word \"reasonable\".19 There is no definite test to adjudge reasonableness of a restriction. Each case is to be judged on its own merits, and no abstract standard, or general pattern of reasonableness is applicable uniformly to all cases. As the Supreme Court has observed in State of Madras v. V.G. Row :20 \"It is important in this context to bear in mind that the test of reasonableness, wherever prescribed, should be applied to each individual statute impugned, and no abstract standard or general pattern, of reasonableness can be laid down as applicable to all cases.\" However, the Courts have laid down a few broad propositions in this respect. Page 1125 When the law contains 'substantive' restrictions with regard to the exercise of the right, as well as 'procedural' provisions, the Courts would consider the reasonableness of both. For adjudging reasonableness of a restriction, the Courts consider such factors as: the duration and the extent of the restrictions; the circumstances under which, and the manner in which, that imposition has been authorised.",

    "content": "nature of the right infringed, the underlying purpose of the restrictions imposed, the extent and the urgency of the evil sought to be remedied thereby, the disproportion of the imposition, the prevailing conditions at the time, all these considerations enter into the judicial verdict.21 The Court, confronted with a challenge to the constitutional validity of any legislative enactment by reference to Article 19 of the Constitution, shall first ask what is the sweep of the Fundamental Right guaranteed by the relevant sub clause out of sub clauses (a) to (g) of clause (1). If the right canvassed falls within the sweep and expanse of any of the sub-clauses of clause (1), then the next question to be asked would be, whether the impugned law imposes a reasonable restriction falling within the scope of clauses (2) to (6) respectively. However, if the right sought to be canvassed does not fall within the sweep of the Fundamental Rights but is a mere concomitant or adjunct or expansion or incidence of that right, then the validity thereof is not to be tested by reference to clauses (2) to (6). The test which it would be required to satisfy for its constitutional validity is one of reasonableness, as propounded in the case of V.G. Row22 or if it comes into conflict with any other provisions of the constitution. The questions : (i) whether the right claimed is a Fundamental Right, (ii) whether the restriction is one contemplated by any of clauses (2) to (6) of Article 19, and (iii) whether the restriction is reasonable or unreasonable, are all questions which shall have to be decided by keeping in view the substance of the legislation and not beguiled by the mere appearance of the legislation.23 Thus, the standard of reasonableness is to be judged with due reference to the subject-matter of the legislation in question, economic and social conditions in India and the surrounding circumstances. The Supreme Court has emphasized in Pathumma24 that in interpreting the constitutional provision, the Court should keep in mind the social setting of the country so as to show a complete consciousness and deep awareness of the growing requirements of the society, the increasing needs of the nation, the burning problems of the day and the complex issues facing the people which the legislature in its wisdom through beneficial legislation seeks to solve. The judicial approach should be dynamic rather than static, pragmatic and not pedantic, and elastic rather than rigid. The concept of reasonableness must change with passage of time and absorb the current socio-economic values as exemplified in Telecasting case involving the State owned Doordarshan. The complaint of violation of the Fundamental Right under Art. 19(1)(a) of the Constitution was made against Doordarshan when it decided not to telecast a documentary film titled \"Father, Son and Holy War\". The film was the third part of a trilogy of documentary film against communal violence. In this film the respondent film maker looked at the question of gender along with the issue of religious violence (prompted by the understanding of Sati in Deorala and thousands of young men celebrating the death of Roop Kanwar). The filmmaker challenged the refusal of Doordarshan to telecast the film which was disposed of by a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court by directing Doordarshan to take a decision on the application of the film maker. A selection committee was constituted by Doordarshan to pre-view the film and according to the Committee the violence depicted in the film would have adverse effect on the minds of the viewers. This decision came up for consideration before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court came to the conclusion that the film maker had a right to convey his perception on the oppression of women, flawed understanding of manhood and evils of communal violence throughout the film. The film, according to the Court, in its entirety had a serious message to convey which was relevant in the present context and Doordarshan, being a state controlled agency funded by public funds, could not have denied access to screen the documentary. The Court pointed out that the test of fairness has to be looked into from various angles and common sense point of view; the manner in which the film maker has handled the thinking the absence of offensive matters like vulgarity and obscenity etc. The Court considered the implications of the states power to impose reasonable restrictions under Article 19(2). It also took note of the fact that India was a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and observed: Page 1126 \"The catchword here is reasonable restriction which corresponds to societal norms of decency. In the present matter, the documentary film Father, Son and Holy War depicts social vices that are eating into the very foundation of our Constitution. Communal riots, caste and class issues and violence against women are issues that require every citizen's attention for a feasible solution. Only the citizens especially the youth of our nation who are correctly informed can arrive at a correct solution. This documentary film in our considered opinion showcases a real picture of crime and violence against women and members of various religious groups perpetrated by politically motivated leaders for political, social and personal gains.\"25 The limitation imposed on a freedom should not be arbitrary or excessive, or beyond what is required in the situation in the interests of the public.26 A legislation arbitrarily or excessively invading the right cannot be characterised as reasonable. A restriction should strike a proper balance between the freedom guaranteed by any of the clauses and the social control, so that the freedom is limited only to the extent necessary to protect society of which a citizen is only a part.27 This introduces the principle of proportionality. This means that the Court would consider whether the restriction imposed by legislation on the Fundamental Right are disproportionate to the situation and are \"not the least restrictive of the choices\".",

The restrictions are imposed by law on the Fundamental Rights contained in Art. 19(1)(a) to (g) and the Courts are entitled to consider the \"proportionality\" of these restrictions which means that the restrictions should not be \"arbitrary or of an excessive\" nature, beyond what is required for achieving the objects of the legislation. Legislation which arbitrarily or excessively invades the Fundamental Right, cannot be said to contain the quality of reasonableness unless it strikes a proper balance between the Fundamental Right guaranteed and the restriction imposed thereon.28 Further, a restriction to be valid must have a direct and proximate nexus, or a rational relation with the object which the legislature seeks to achieve and must not be in excess of the object.29 It is the substance of the legislation, and not merely its appearance or form, which is to be taken into consideration while assessing its validity. It is the direct, inevitable and the real, not the remote, effect of the legislation on the Fundamental Right which is to be considered,30 subject to the rider that the legislature cannot indirectly take away or abridge a Fundamental Right when it cannot do so directly.31 The Directive Principles of State Policy are also relevant in considering whether a restriction on a Fundamental Right is reasonable or not.32 A restriction which promotes a Directive Principle is generally regarded as reasonable.33 As the Supreme Court has observed in Kasturi Lal Lakshmi Reddy,34 \"Any action taken by the Government with a view to giving effect to any one or more of the Directive Principles would ordinarily, subject to any constitutional or legal inhibitions or other overriding considerations, qualify for being regarded as reasonable, while an action which is inconsistent with or runs counter to a Directive Principle would incur the reproach of being unreasonable. So also the concept of public interest must as far as possible receive its orientation from the Directive Principles.\"35 In Papnasam,36 the Supreme Court has stated that the following principles and guidelines should be kept in view while considering the constitutionality of a statutory provision imposing restriction on a Fundamental Right guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(a) to (g) when challenged on the ground of unreasonableness of the restriction imposed by it: (a) The restriction must not be arbitrary or of an excessive nature so as to go beyond the requirement of felt need of the society and object sought to be achieved. (b) There must be a direct and proximate nexus or a reasonable connection between the restriction imposed and the object sought to beachived. (c) No abstract or fixed principle can be laid down which may have universal application in all cases. Such consideration on the question of qualify of reasonableness, therefore, is expected to vary from case to case. (d) In interpreting constitutional provisions, the Court should be alive to the felt need of the society and complex issues facing the people which the legislature intends to solve through effective legislation. (e) In appreciating such problems and felt need of the society the judicial approach must necessarily be dynamic, pragmatic and elastic. Page 1127 (f) It is imperative that for consideration of reasonableness of restriction imposed by a statute, the Court should examine whether the social control as envisaged in Art. 19 is being effectuated by the restriction imposed on the Fundamental Right. (g) The Rights guaranteed to a citizen by Art. 19 do not confer any absolute or unconditional right. Each Right is subject to reasonable restriction which the legislature may impose in public interest. It is therefore necessary to examine whether such restriction is meant to protect social welfare satisfying the need of prevailing social values. (h) The reasonableness has got to be tested both from the procedural and substantive aspects. It should not be bound by procedural perniciousness or jurisprudence of remedies. (i) A restriction imposed on a Fundamental Right guaranteed by Art. 19 must not be arbitrary, unbridled, uncanalised and excessive and also not unreasonably discriminatory. Ex hypothesi, therefore, a restriction to be reasonable must also be consistent with Art. 14 of the Constitution.37 (j) In judging the reasonableness of the restriction imposed under Art. 19(6), the Court has to bear in mind Directive Principles of State Policy.38 (k) Ordinarily, any restriction so imposed which has the effect of promoting or effectuating a Directive Principle can be presumed to be reasonable restriction in public interest. It is clear from the above that a Court evaluating the reasonableness of a restriction imposed on a Fundamental Right guaranteed by Art. 19 enjoys a lot of discretion in the matter. A statute imposing a restriction with retrospective effect is not prima facie unreasonable; but retrospectivity is an element to be taken into consideration in determining whether the restriction is reasonable or not.39 A law affecting a Fundamental Right may be held bad for sheer vagueness and uncertainty.40 The word 'restriction' includes 'prohibition'. Under certain circumstances, therefore, a law depriving a citizen of his Fundamental Right may be regarded as reasonable.41 A restriction to be valid must have a rational relation with the grounds for which the legislature is entitled to impose restrictions. These grounds are laid down in Arts. 19(2) to (6). Too remote connection between a restriction and the constitutionally authorized ground for restriction will render the law invalid.42 When a law is found to infringe a right guaranteed by Art.",

    "content": "certain circumstances, therefore, a law depriving a citizen of his Fundamental Right may be regarded as reasonable.41 A restriction to be valid must have a rational relation with the grounds for which the legislature is entitled to impose restrictions. These grounds are laid down in Arts. 19(2) to (6). Too remote connection between a restriction and the constitutionally authorized ground for restriction will render the law invalid.42 When a law is found to infringe a right guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(a) to (g), the law will be invalid unless it can be brought under the protective provisions of Arts. 19(2) to (6). The burden to show this is on those who seek that protection and not on the citizen to show that the restrictive enactment is invalid.43 Thus, the onus is on the state to justify that the restriction imposed on any Fundamental Right guaranteed by Arts. 19(1)(a) to (g) is reasonable under clauses 19(2) to (6).44 Where a law purports to authorise the imposition of restrictions on a Fundamental Right in language wide enough to cover restrictions both within and without the limits of constitutionally permissible legislative actions affecting such right, it is not possible to uphold it even insofar as it may be applied within the constitutional limits as it is not severable.45 So long as the possibility of such a provision being applied for purposes not sanctioned by the Constitution cannot be ruled out, it may be held to be wholly unconstitutional and void. For example, Art. 19(2) allows imposition of restrictions on the freedom of speech and expression only in cases where danger to the state is involved (Public order/Security of State), an enactment which is capable of being applied to cases where no such danger could arise cannot be held to be constitutional and valid to any extent.46 The above are only a few general guiding norms and not absolutes applicable with mathematical precision in judging the reasonableness of a restriction. The Judges enjoy a broad discretion in this respect as the Supreme Court itself has stated:47 \"In evaluating such elusive factors and forming their own conception of what is reasonable in all the circumstances of a given case, it is inevitable that the social philosophy and the scale of values of the judges participating in the decision should play an important part, and limit to their interference with legislative judgment in such cases can only be dictated by their sense of responsibility and self-restraint and the sobering reflection that the Constitution is meant not only for people of their way of thinking but for all, that the majority of the elected representatives of the people have, in authorising the imposition of the restrictions, considered them to be reasonable.\" Page 1128 A consequence of such judicial discretion is the creation of uncertainty as to what constitutes a 'reasonable' restriction on a Fundamental Right. It is not always easy to find a common denominator in the various judicial pronouncements in this area as will be evident from the discussion that follows. It needs to be emphasized that any restriction under Arts. 19(2) to 19(6) on any right guaranteed by Arts. 19(1)(a) to (g) can be imposed only by a law and not through a mere administrative direction or departmental instructions which have no statutory force.48 (b) EFFECT V. SUBJECT-MATTER TEST A significant point which arises from a study of the above cases deserves to be mentioned here. What is the test to be applied to ascertain whether a law violates Art. 19(1)(a), or any other Fundamental Right? Should the Courts look into its subject-matter or the effect of the legislation for this purpose? In Bennett Coleman,49 the Central Government argued in support of the newsprint policy that its subject-matter was rationing of imported commodity and not freedom of speech, and the test to adjudge the validity of a regulatory provision should be its subject-matter, its pith and substance, and not its effect or result. The Court rejected this approach and enunciated the test: What is the 'direct' or 'inevitable' consequence or effect of the impugned state action on the Fundamental Right of the petitioner? \"The true test is whether the effect of the impugned action is to take away or abridge Fundamental Rights.\" A legislation or government action may have a direct effect on a Fundamental Right although its subject-matter may be different. The object of the law or executive action is irrelevant when it infringes a Fundamental Right although its subject-matter may be different. Even a law dealing directly with a purpose mentioned in Art. 19(2) would be invalid if it is not reasonable. The Court stated that \"no law or action would state in words that rights of freedom of speech and expression are abridged or taken away. That is why Courts have to protect and guard Fundamental Rights by considering the scope and provisions of the Act and its effect upon the Fundamental Rights.\" The Court held that, in the instant case, the object of the restrictions imposed on newspapers has nothing to do with the availability of newsprint or foreign exchange because these were post-quota restrictions which fell outside the purview of Art. 19(2). Thus, in the instant case, the Court applied the test of 'direct effect' of law on a Fundamental Right. The 'effect' test has been applied by the Supreme Court in Maneka Gandhi50 and several other cases.51 For example, in the Bank Nationalization case,52 the Supreme Court has said that it is the direct operation of the Act upon the rights which form the real test. However, earlier, in the Gopalan case,53 the Supreme Courthad applied the test of subject-matter in order to uphold the validity of the Preventive Detention Act against a challenge under Art. 19(1)(a).54 Logically, the Bennett Coleman approach should mean that the validity of the Preventive Detention Act should be adjudged with reference to Art. 19(1)(a) as well along with Arts.",

It may, however, be noted that under the Bennett Coleman doctrine, it is the 'direct' effect on a Fundamental Right which is determinative. A difference of judicial opinion is possible on the question whether the 'effect' of a provision on a Fundamental Right is 'direct' or 'indirect'.57 C. FREEDOM OF SPEECH: ARTICLES 19(1)(A) AND 19(2) (a) IMPORTANCE OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH Freedom of speech is the bulwark of democratic government. This freedom is essential for the proper functioning of the democratic process. The freedom of speech and expression is regarded as the first condition of liberty. It occupies a preferred position in the hierarchy of liberties giving succour and protection Page 1129 to all other liberties. It has been truly said that it is the mother of all other liberties.58 In a democracy, freedom of speech and expression opens up channels of free discussion of issues. Freedom of speech plays a crucial role in the formation of public opinion on social, political and economic matters. Freedom of speech and expression, just as equality clause and the guarantee of life and liberty has been very broadly construed by the Supreme Court right from the 1950s. It has been variously described as a \"basic human right\", \"a natural right\" and the like. It embraces within its scope the freedom of propagation and interchange of ideas, dissemination of information which would help formation of one's opinion and view point and debates on matters of public concern. So long as the expression is confined to nationalism, patriotism and love for the motherland, the use of the National Flag by way of expression of those sentiments would be a Fundamental Right. It cannot be used for commercial purpose or otherwise. The law in USA not only recognizes the right to fly National Flag but it has gone to the extent of holding flag burning as an expression of free speech and free expression of its citizens against the establishment but our constitution does not approve the latter part of the right as envisaged in the U.S.59 In Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, 60 Bhagwati, J., has emphasized on the significance of the freedom of speech and expression in these words: \"Democracy is based essentially on free debate and open discussion, for that is the only corrective of government action in a democratic set up. If democracy means government of the people by the people, it is obvious that every citizen must be entitled to participate in the democratic process and in order to enable him to intelligently exercise his right of making a choice, free and general discussion of public matters is absolutely essential.\" In 1927, in Whitney v. California, 61 Louis Brandeis, J., made a classic statement on the freedom of speech in the context of the U.S. Constitution: \"Those who won our independence believed that the final end of the state was to make men free to develop their faculties... They believed liberty to be the secret of happiness and courage to be the secret of liberty. They believed that the freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth; that without free speech and assembly discussion would be futile.... that public discussion is a political duty; and that this should be a fundamental principle of the American government.\" Talking about the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution which guarantees freedom of speech in the U.S.A. The U.S. Supreme Court has observed:62 \"It is the purpose of the First Amendment to preserve an uninhibited market place of ideas in which truth will ultimately prevail, rather than to countenance monopolization of that market whether it be by the Government itself or a private licensee\". (b) ARTICLE 19(1)(A) OF THE CONSTITUTION Out of the several rights enumerated in clause (1) of Article 19, the right in sub-clause (a) is not merely a right of speech and expression but a right to freedom of speech and expression. The enumeration of other rights is not by reference to freedom.63 Article 19(1) (a) guarantees to all citizens the right to 'freedom of speech and expression'. Under Art. 19(2), 'reasonable restrictions can be imposed on the exercise of this right for certain purposes. Any limitation on the exercise of the right under Art. 19(1)(a) not falling within the four corners of Art. 19(2) cannot be valid. The freedom of speech under Art. 19(1)(a) includes the right to express one's views and opinions at any issue through any medium, e.g., by words of mouth, writing, printing, picture, film, movie, etc. It thus includes the freedom of communication and the right to propagate or publish opinion. But this right is subject to reasonable restrictions being imposed under Art. 19(2). Free expression cannot be equated or confused with a licence to make unfounded and irresponsible allegations against the judiciary.64 Article 19(1) (a) corresponds to Amendment I of the U.S. Constitution which says: \"Congress shall make no Page 1130 law....abridging the freedom of speech or of the press.\" Unlike Art. 19(1)(a) of the Indian Constitution, the provision in the U.S. Constitution has two notable features, viz., (1) Freedom of Press is specifically mentioned therein; (2) No restrictions are mentioned on the freedom of speech unlike Art. 19(2) which spells out the restrictions on Art. 19(1).",

The Courts in the U.S.A. have to spell out the restrictions on this right from case to case.65 This provision protects the right to receive information and ideas. The First Amendment preserves \"an uninhibited market place of ideas in which truth will ultimately prevail... It is the right of the public to receive suitable access to social, political, aesthetic, moral and other ideas and experiences\".66 As stated earlier, in case of a conflict between the freedom of speech under Art. 19(1)(a) and the privilege of Parliament or a State Legislature under Art. 105 or 194 respectively, the freedom of speech will give way to accommodate the legislative privilege.67 It has also been ruled by the Supreme Court that the freedom of speech available to a Member of Parliament under Art. 105(1) (as well as to a Member of a State Legislature under Art. 194(1)] is wider in amplitude than the right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Art. 19(1)(a) since the freedom of speech of the members of a Legislature on the floor of the House under Art. 105(1) is not subject to the limitations contained in Art. 19(2).68 The Jammu & Kashmir Legislature has passed an anti-defection law requiring a member of the legislature to resign his seat in the legislature if he defects from the party to which he belonged at the time of his election to the legislature. The purpose of the law is to discourage defection which has so much vitiated the country's political atmosphere. The law was challenged under Art. 19(1)(a) on the ground that it unreasonably curbs the right of dissent and violates the freedom of speech and expression of a legislator. Rejecting the challenge, the Court has pointed out that the totality of rights enjoyed by a legislator including the freedom to speak on the floor of the House are merely privileges governed by Art. 105 and not Fundamental Rights.69 In Kihota Hollohon v. Zachilhu, 70 the Supreme Court has refused to test the anti-defection law passed by Parliament to prohibit defection of members of Legislatures and Parliament from one political party to another against the touchstone of Art. 19(1)(a). Here arises a clash of two values--(i) freedom of speech and expression; (ii) to improve and strengthen the democratic fabric of the country. The Court has given preference to promotion of democracy over freedom of speech and expression if there is any inconsistency between the two. \"Unprincipled defection is a political and social evil.\" It subverts democracy. An exhibitor of video films, it has been held, cannot claim protection of Art. 19(1)(a) as he is not propagating or circulating any of his own views. The producer of a film can, but a mere exhibitor of video films cannot, claim protection of Art. 19(1)(a).A right of a film maker to make and exhibit his film is a part of his Fundamental Right of freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) and the restrictions imposed under Sections 4 and 5A of the Cinematograph Act, 1952 relating to certification by Censor Board by applying the guiding principles set out inSection 5B is a reasonable restrictions contemplated under Article 19(2).71 The exhibitor shows films merely to earn profit and not to propagate any ideas or arousing any public opinion. An exhibitor of films cannot be equated with circulation or distribution of newspapers. Exhibiting films is a commercial activity. Circulation of newspapers and magazines continues with the publisher but the film after production goes out of the producer's hands for being exhibited by such persons as are totally unconnected with production.72 The phrase 'speech and expression' used in Art. 19(1)(a) has broad connotation. The right to paint or sing or dance or to write poetry or literature is also covered by Art. 19(1)(a) because the common basic characteristic of all these activities is freedom of speech and expression.73 THE RIGHT TO FLY NATIONAL FLAG AND SING NATIONAL ANTHEM The right to fly the national flag however is neither unfettered, unsubscribed, unrestricted nor unchannellised. Right to fly the flag is regulated by the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950 and Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971. Page 1131 National Anthem, National Flag and National Song are secular symbols of the nationhood. They represent the supreme collective expression of commitment and loyalty to the nation as well as patriotism for the country. They are necessary adjuncts of sovereignty being symbols and actions associated therewith. If the unity and integrity of India is to be perceived in diverse situations, the feeling of loyalty, commitment and patriotism can be judged not only by giving effect to constitutionalism but also on their secular symbols. Unrestricted use of the National Flag may result in commercial exploitation of the flag. The unrestricted use of the National Flag may result in its indiscriminate use in procession, meetings etc. Instances of insults to the National Flag as a matter of protest may also occur. It must certainly be treated with the utmost respect and dignity. This might not be possible without imposing any restrictions on its use. Flag Code although is not a law within the meaning of Article 13(3)(a) of the Constitution of India, for the purpose of clause (2) of Article 19 it would not restrictively regulate the free exercise of the right of flying the National Flag. But the Flag Code to the extent it provides for preserving respect and dignity of the National Flag, the same deserves to be followed.74 In other words, our National Flag cannot suffer any indignity.",

In Baragur Ramachandrappa75 The Supreme Court rejected the challenge that Section 95 of the Criminal Procedure Code which confers power on the State Government to forfeit certain publications referred to in that section including news papers, was violative of Article 19(1) (a). The issue as to the validity of the section arose in relation to a book which was considered by the petitioner to be objectionable, inflammatory, hurtful and insulting to the sentiments and feelings of a religious sect known as Veerashaivas who were the followers of Basaveshwara, a great saint of the twelfth century. On behalf of the author it was contended that the entire matter should be examined in the backdrop of the philosophy and principles underlying sub clause (h) of the Article 51A of the Constitution which envisaged the development of a scientific temperament, a feeling of humanism and a spirit of inquiry and reform as well as the Fundamental Right to freedom of speech under Article 19(1)(a). The Court after taking into consideration the vast disparities in language, culture and religion in the country, was of the view that unwarranted and malicious criticism or interference in the faith of others could not be accepted, and after referring to certain earlier cases of the Court76 held that the challenge could not be sustained on the finding that publication of a book which endangers public order and held that the extracts quoted from \"The Book\" from chapter XII were not in sync with the rest of the novel and had been deliberately designed to be hurtful. (c) RIGHT TO SILENCE The right to speech implies the right to silence. It implies freedom, not to listen, and not to be forced to listen. The right comprehends the freedom to be free from what one desires to be free from. A loudspeaker forces a person to hear what he wishes not to hear. The use of a loudspeaker may be incidental to the exercise of the right but, its use is not a matter of right, or part of the rights guaranteed by Article 19(1).77 (d) RIGHT TO RECEIVE INFORMATION The expression \"freedom of speech and expression\" in Art. 19(1)(a) has been held to include the right to acquire information and disseminate the same. It includes the right to communicate it through any available media whether print or electronic or audio-visual, such as, advertisement, movie, article or speech, etc. This freedom includes the freedom to communicate or circulate one's opinion without interference to as large a population in the country, as well as abroad, as is possible to reach. In People's Union for Civil Liberties, the Supreme Court dealt with this aspect of the freedom elaborately. The right of the citizens to obtain information on matters relating to public acts flows from the Fundamental Right enshrined in Art. 19(1)(a). Securing information on the basic details concerning the candidates contesting for elections to Parliament or the State Legislature promotes freedom of expression and therefore the right to information forms an integral part of Article 19(1)(a).78 Freedom of expression, as contemplated by Article 19(1) (a) which in many respects overlaps and coincides with freedom of speech, has manifold meanings. It need not and ought not to be confined to expressing something in words orally or in writing. Even a manifestation of an emotion, feeling etc. without words would amount to expression. Communication of emotion and display of talent through music, painting etc. is also a sort of expression. The Court noted that ballot is the instrument by which the voter expresses his choice Page 1132 between candidates.79 While expounding the scope of \"expression\" in Article 19(1) (a), the Supreme Courthas drawn a distinction between the conferment of the right to vote on fulfillment of requisite criteria and the culmination of that right in the final act of expressing choice towards a particular candidate by means of ballot. The Court pointed out that though the initial right cannot be placed on the pedestal of a fundamental right, but, at the stage when the voter goes to the polling booth and casts his vote, his freedom to express arises. The casting of vote in favour of one or the other candidate tantamounts to expression of his opinion and preference and that final stage in the exercise of voting right marks the accomplishment of freedom of expression of the voter and that is where Article 19(1) (a) is attracted.80 Since right to information is a constituent of the freedom of expression under Art. 19(1)(a), the amended S. 33-B of Representation of People Act, 1951 which provides that notwithstanding anything contained in the judgment of any Court or directions issued by the Election Commission, no candidate shall be liable to disclose or furnish any such information in respect of his election which is not required to be disclosed or furnished under the Act or the rules made thereunder, is on the face of it beyond the legislative competence, as the Supreme Court has held that the voter has a Fundamental Right under Article 19(1)(a) to know the antecedents of a candidate and was therefore ultra vires Act. 19(1)(a).81 It has been said that although elections are fought by political parties, the same would be a farce if the voters are unaware of the antecedents of candidates contesting elections and it would be a vote without any basis. Such elections cannot be considered as free or fair.",

    "content": "concomitant of the right to vote which is the basic postulate of democracy is two fold: First, formulation of an opinion about the candidates; and Secondly the expression of choice by casing a vote in favour of the candidate preferred by the voter.82 In Peoples Union for Civil Liberties83 the petitioners sought disclosure of information relating to safety violations and defects in various nuclear power plants, the Court upheld the contention of Union of India that data about fissile materials are matters of sensitive character which may enable the enemies of the nation to monitor strategic activities and therefore any information relating to training features, processes or technology of nuclear plants cannot be disclosed. Right to information is a facet of the right to freedom of speech and expression as contained in Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. Right to information, thus, indisputably is a Fundamental Right. But the right does not carry with it an unrestricted right to gather information. A reasonable restriction on the exercise of the right to know or right to information is always permissible in the interest of the security of the State. Generally, the exemptions/exceptions under the laws referred to in Article 19(2) entitled the Government to withhold information relating to the following matters : (i) International relations, (ii) National security (including defence) and public safety; (iii) Investigation, detection and prevention of crime; (iv) Internal deliberations of the Government; (v) Information received in confidence from a source outside the Government; (vi) Information, which if disclosed, would violate the privacy of the individual; (vii) Information of an economic nature, (including trade secrets) which, if disclosed, would confer an unfair advantage on some persons or concern, or, subject some person or Government to an unfair disadvantage; (viii) Information which is subject to a claim of legal professional privilege, e.g. communication between a legal adviser and the client; between a physician and the patient; (ix) Information about scientific discoveries.84 (x) Much of this has been covered by the Right to Information Act, 2006 The Supreme Court has given a broad dimension to Art. 19(1)(a) by laying down the proposition that Page 1133 freedom of speech involves not only communication, but also receipt, of information. Communication and receipt of information are the two sides of the same coin. Right to know is a basic right of the citizens of a free country and Art. 19(1)(a) protects this right. The right to receive information springs from the right to freedom of speech and expression enshrined in Art. 19(1)(a). The freedom to receive and to communicate information and ideas without interference is an important aspect of the freedom of speech and expression. Without adequate information, a person cannot form an informed opinion. When allegations of political patronage are made, the public in general has a right to know the circumstances under which their elected representatives got such allotment.85 In case of a matter being part of public records, including Court records cannot be claimed.86 In State of Uttar Pradesh v. Raj Narain, 87 the Supreme Court has held that Art. 19(1)(a) not only guarantees freedom of speech and expression, it also ensures and comprehends the right of the citizens to know, the right to receive information regarding matters of public concern. The Supreme Court has underlined the significance of the right to know in a democracy in these words: \"In a government of responsibility like ours, where all the agents of the public must be responsible for their conduct there can be but few secrets. The people of this country have a right to know every public act, everything that is done in a public way, by their public functionaries. They are entitled to know the particulars of every public transaction in all its bearings. The right to know, which is derived from the concept of freedom of speech, though not absolute, is a factor which should make one wary, when secrecy is claimed for transactions which can, at any rate, have no repercussion on public security. To cover with veil of secrecy, the common routine business, is not in the interest of the public. Such secrecy can seldom be legitimately desired. It is generally desired for the purpose of parties and politics or personal self-interest or bureaucratic routine. The responsibility of officials to explain and to justify their acts is the chief safeguard against oppression and corruption\". In Secretary, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Govt. of India v. Cricket Association of Bengal, 88 the Supreme Court reiterated the proposition that the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(a) includes the right to acquire information and to disseminate the same. In Dinesh Trivedi, M.P. and Others v. Union of India, 89 the Supreme Court dealt with the right to freedom of information and observed \"in modern constitutional democracies, it is axiomatic that citizens have a right to know about the affairs of the government which, having been elected by them, seek to formulate sound policies of governance aimed at their welfare\". The Court further observed: \"Democracy expects openness and openness is concomitant of a free society and the sunlight is a best disinfectant\". The Delhi High Court in Association for Democratic Reforms v. Union of India, 90 has emphasized that the right to receive information acquires great significance in the context of elections.91 It is now common knowledge that there is criminalisation of politics in India. It is a matter of great concern that anti-social and criminals are seeking to enter the political arena through the mechanism of elections to State Legislatures and even to Parliament. Parliament has not yet been able to enact a law to uproot the evil. In this scenario, the Delhi High Court has sought to cleanse the electoral process through the mechanism of the right to know of the people.",

    "content": "has not yet been able to enact a law to uproot the evil. In this scenario, the Delhi High Court has sought to cleanse the electoral process through the mechanism of the right to know of the people. The Delhi High Court has ruled that from every candidate for election, the Election Commission shall secure for the voters the following information: (1) Whether the candidate is accused of any offence punishable with imprisonment. (2) Assets possessed by the candidate, his or her spouse and dependant children. (3) Facts denoting the candidate's competence and suitability for being a parliamentarian. This should include the candidate's educational qualification. (4) Any other relevant information regarding candidates' competence to be a member of Parliament or State Legislature. It needs to be emphasized that through its pronouncement, the Delhi High Court is not seeking to impose any additional qualification on a candidate over and above what the Constitution and the relevant law Page 1134 prescribe. What the Court is seeking to achieve is that a voter after knowing the background of the candidate will vote properly. As the Court has said, \"... since the future of the country depends upon the power of the ballot, the voters must be given an opportunity for making an informed decision.\" Exercise of the informed option to vote in favour or against a candidate will strengthen democracy in the country and root out the evil of corruption and criminality at present extant in politics. On appeal, the Supreme Court substantially agreed with The Delhi High Court. The Court has upheld the right of a voter to know about the antecedents of his candidate as a part of his Fundamental Right under Art. 19(1)(a). Democracy cannot survive without free and fairly informed voters. The Court has observed: \"... one-sided information, disinformation, mis-information and non-information will equally create an uniformed citizenary which makes democracy a faree... Freedom of speech and expression includes right to impart and receive information which includes freedom to hold opinions\".1 The Court has ruled that candidates for the Lok Sabha or State Legislative Assemblies would have to disclose their antecedents, assets and educational qualifications to help the electorate make the right choice. The Court has said: \"Votes cast by uninformed voters in favour of a candidate would be meaningless.\" The common man may think twice before electing law-breakers as law-makers. Reiterating that law-makers are public servants and, therefore, the people of the country have a right to know about every public act by public functionaries, including MPs and MLAs who are public functionaries. Rejecting the argument that the voters do not have a right to know about the \"private\" affairs of public functionaries, the Court has observed: \"There are widespread allegations of corruption against persons holding post and power. In such a situation, the question is not of knowing personal affairs but to have openness in democracy for attempting to cure the cancerous growth of corruption by a few rays of light\". The Court has said that the Election Commission must make it mandatory for the candidates to give details on the following counts: [#8902] Whether the candidate is convicted or acquitted or discharged of any criminal offence in the past--whether he has been punished with imprisonment or fine? [#8902] Prior to six months of filing of nomination, whether the candidates has been accused in any pending case, of any offence punishable with imprisonment for two years or more. Whether charge is framed or cognisance is taken by the Court of law, if so details thereof; [#8902] The assets (immovable, movable, bank balances etc) of a candidate and of his/her spouse and that of dependants; [#8902] Liabilities, if any, particularly whether there are any overdues of any public financial institution or government dues; [#8902] The educational qualification of the candidate. It will be appreciated that the judiciary has used its craftsmanship to harness the right to information to achieve an extremely laudable social objective, viz., that of preventing criminalisation of the Indian politics. Since right to information is not absolute, a report made by Committee of Judges regarding the conduct of High Court Judges to the Chief Justice of India is wholly confidential and is only for the purpose of satisfaction of the Chief Justice of India. It is purely preliminary in nature, ad hoc and not final. The authority by which the Chief Justice of India can exercise this power of inquiry is moral or ethical and not in the exercise of powers under any law. Exercise of such power of the Chief Justice of India based on moral authority cannot be made the subject matter of a writ petition to disclose a report made to him.2 (e) FREEDOM OF THE PRESS Page 1135 In the U.S.A., the First Amendment, mentioned above, specifically protects a free press. The view developed by the U.S. Supreme Court is that freedom of the press includes more than merely serving as a \"neutral conduit of information between the people and their elected leaders or as a neutral form of debate.\" The prime purpose of the free press guarantee is regarded as creating a fourth institution outside the government as an additional check on the three official branches--executive, legislative and the judiciary.3 It is the primary function of the press to provide comprehensive and objective information on all aspects of the country's social, economic and political life. The press serves as a powerful antidote to any abuse of power by government officials and as a means for keeping the elected officials responsible to the people whom they were elected to serve. The democratic credentials of a state are judged today by the extent of the freedom press enjoys in that state.",

    "content": "J., of the U.S. Supreme Court has observed that \"acceptance by Government of a dissident press is a measure of the maturity of the nation.\"4 Suppression of the right of the press to praise or criticise government agents and to clamour and contend for or against change violates the First Amendment by restraining one of the very agencies the framers of the U.S. Constitution selected to improve the American society and to keep it free.5 The freedom of speech and of the press is protected not only from direct government encroachment but also from more subtle government interference. The U.S. Supreme Court has emphasized that it has power to nullify \"action which encroaches on freedom of utterance under the guise of punishing libel.\"6 In India, freedom of the press is implied from the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(a). There is no specific provision ensuring freedom of the press as such. The freedom of the press is regarded as a \"species of which freedom of expression is a genus.\"7 Thus, being only a right flowing from the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press in India stands on no higher footing than the freedom of speech of a citizen, and the press enjoys no privilege as such distinct from the freedom of the citizen. The Supreme Court has laid emphasis in several cases on the importance of maintaining freedom of press in a democratic society. The press seeks to advance public interest by publishing facts and opinions without which a democratic electorate cannot make responsible judgments. Articles and news are published in the press from time to time to expose the weaknesses of the government. This leads at times to the suppression of the freedom of the press by the government. It is, therefore, the primary duty of the Courts to uphold the said freedom and invalidate all laws or administrative actions which interfere with the freedom of the press contrary to the constitutional mandate.8 In Printers (Mysore) Ltd. v. Assistant Commercial Tax Officer, 9 the Supreme Court has reiterated that though freedom of the press is not expressly guaranteed as a Fundamental Right, it is implicit in the freedom of speech and expression. Freedom of the press has always been a cherished right in all democratic countries and the press has rightly been described as the fourth estate. The democratic credentials of a state are judged by the extent of freedom the press enjoys in that state. The Supreme Court has emphasized that the freedom of the press is not so much for the benefit of the press as for the benefit of the general community because the community has a right to be supplied with information and the government owes a duty to educate the people within the limits of its resources. Article 19(1) (a) applies to citizens only and so a non-citizen running a newspaper cannot seek the guarantee of this constitutional provision. Imposition of pre-censorship on a newspaper,10 or prohibiting it from publishing its own views or those of its correspondents on a burning topic of the day,11 constitute an encroachment on the freedom of speech and expression. The freedom of speech and expression includes freedom to propagate ideas which is ensured by freedom of circulation of a publication, as a publication is of little value without circulation. Therefore, imposition of a ban upon entry and circulation of a journal within a State is restriction of Art. 19(1)(a).12 Olivier v. Buttigieg, 13 a Privy Council case from Malta, is interesting on the point of circulation. The constitutional provisions in India and Malta regarding freedom of speech are practically synonymous. The Page 1136 church authorities condemned 'Voice of Malta', a paper run by the opposition party. The Health Minister thereupon issued a circular prohibiting the entry of the newspaper in the various hospitals and branches of the Health Department. The entry of any other newspaper was not prohibited. The Privy Council decided that the Minister's order amounted to a hindrance in the way of the editor of the paper in the enjoyment of his freedom to impart ideas and information which is an essential part of the freedom of speech and expression. The Privy Council refused to accept the argument that the hindrance was slight and that it could be ignored as being de minimis. (f)SAKAL PAPERS An Act14 and a government order15 thereunder sought to regulate the number of pages according to the price charged, prescribed the number of supplements to be published, and regulate the size and area of advertisements in relation to other matter contained in a newspaper. Thus, the number of pages published by a newspaper depended upon the price charged to the readers. The Supreme Court ruled it invalid for its purpose was to reduce circulation of some newspapers by making their price unattractively high for their readers. Reduction in the area for advertisements would reduce revenues forcing the newspapers to raise their prices which was also bound to affect circulation. This directly affected the freedom of speech and expression because inherent in this freedom is the right to publish and circulate the publication. Art 19(1)(a) guarantees not only what a person circulates but also the volume of circulation. \"The freedom of a newspaper to publish any number of pages or to circulate it to any number of persons is each an integral part of the freedom of speech and expression. A restraint placed upon either of them would be a direct infringement of the right of freedom of speech and expression\" Being a restriction on Art. 19(1)(a), it was not related to any of the purposes mentioned in Art. 19(2), and so it was invalid.16 In the instant case, the Central Government sought to support the Act and the order by pleading that they regulated the commercial aspects of the newspapers, and not dissemination of news and views by them, and amounted to reasonable restrictions under Art.",

    "content": "it was not related to any of the purposes mentioned in Art. 19(2), and so it was invalid.16 In the instant case, the Central Government sought to support the Act and the order by pleading that they regulated the commercial aspects of the newspapers, and not dissemination of news and views by them, and amounted to reasonable restrictions under Art. 19(6).17 The Court agreed that newspapers have two aspects--dissemination of news and views and commercial. The two aspects are different, the former falls under Art. 19(1)(a) read with Art. 19(2), and the latter falls under Art. 19(1)(g) and can be regulated under Art. 19(6).18 However, the state cannot seek to place restrictions on business by directly and immediately curtailing any other freedom of the citizen guaranteed by the Constitution and which is not susceptible of abridgement on the same grounds as are set out in Art. 19(6). \"Therefore, the right of freedom of speech cannot be taken away with the object of placing restrictions on the business activities of a citizen.\" The grounds on which the two freedoms--of speech and of trade and commerce--can be curtailed are different. The freedom of speech cannot be curtailed 'in the interests of the general public', but the freedom to carry on business can be. If a law directly affecting freedom of speech is challenged, \"it is no answer that the restrictions enacted by it are justifiable under clauses (3) to (6).\" Article 19 enumerates different freedoms separately and then specifies the extent of restrictions to which each of them can be subjected and the objects for securing which this could be done.19A citizen is entitled to enjoy each and every one of the freedoms together and Art. 19(1) does not prefer one freedom to another. The state cannot make a law which directly restricts one freedom even for securing the better enjoyment of another freedom. \"All the greater reason, therefore, for holding that the state cannot directly restrict one freedom by placing an otherwise permissible restriction on another freedom.\" Therefore, referring the press as a business and justifying the impugned restriction under Art. 19(6) as a proper restriction on the right to carry on the business of publishing a newspaper \"would be wholly irrelevant for considering whether the impugned Act infringes or does not infringe the freedom guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(a).\" This means that freedom of speech cannot be restricted for the purpose of regulating the commercial aspect of the activities of the newspapers. As the purpose of the law in question was to effect directly the right of circulation of newspapers \"which would necessarily undermine their power to influence public opinion it cannot but be regarded as a Page 1137 dangerous weapon which is capable of being used against democracy itself.\" The Court emphasized, \"The freedom of speech and expression of opinion is of paramount importance under a democratic constitution which envisages changes in the composition of legislatures and Governments and must be preserved.\"20 (g)BENNETT COLEMAN Bennett Coleman & Co. v. Union of India, 21 is a case of great significance in the area of freedom of speech and expression. India faces a shortage of indigenous newsprint. Therefore, newsprint has to be imported from foreign countries. Because of the shortage of foreign exchange, quantity of newsprint imported was not adequate to meet all requirements. Some restrictions, therefore, became necessary on the consumption of newsprint. Accordingly, a system of newsprint quota for newspapers was evolved. The actual consumption of newsprint by a newspaper during the year 1970-71 or 1971-72, whichever was less, was taken as the base. For dailies with a circulation up to 100,00 copies, 10 per cent increase in the basic entitlement was to be granted, but for newspapers with a larger circulation, the increase was to be only 3 per cent. Newspapers with less than 10 pages daily could raise the number of pages by 20 per cent subject to the ceiling of 10. A few more restrictions were imposed on the user of newsprint. The dominant direction of the policy was to curtail the growth of big newspapers which could not increase the number of pages, page-area or periodicity by reducing circulation to meet their requirements even within their admissible quota of newsprint. This newsprint policy was challenged in the Supreme Court. By a majority, the Supreme Court declared the policy unconstitutional. While the Government could evolve a policy of allotting newsprint on a fair and equitable basis, keeping in view the interests of small, medium and big newspapers, the Government could not, in the garb of regulating distribution of newsprint, control the growth and circulation of newspapers. In effect, here the newsprint policy became the newspaper control policy. While newsprint quota could be fixed on a reasonable basis, post-quota restrictions could not be imposed. The newspapers should be left free to determine their pages, circulation and new editions within their fixed quota. The policy of limiting all papers whether small or large, in English or an Indian language, to 10 pages was held to be discriminatory as it treated unequals as equals. The restrictions imposed cut at the very root of the guaranteed freedom. The Court stated:22 \"The effect and consequence of the impugned policy upon the newspapers is directly controlling the growth and circulation of newspapers. The direct effect is the restriction upon circulation of newspapers. The direct effect is upon growth of newspapers through pages. The direct effect is that newspapers are deprived of their area of advertisement. The direct effect is that they are exposed to financial loss. The direct effect is that freedom of speech and expression is infringed.\" The Court maintained that the freedom of the press embodies the right of the people to speak and express. The freedom of speech and expression is not only in the volume of circulation but also in the volume of news and views. The press has the right of free publication and their circulation without any obvious restraint on publication.",

    "content": "direct effect is that they are exposed to financial loss. The direct effect is that freedom of speech and expression is infringed.\" The Court maintained that the freedom of the press embodies the right of the people to speak and express. The freedom of speech and expression is not only in the volume of circulation but also in the volume of news and views. The press has the right of free publication and their circulation without any obvious restraint on publication. In the words of the Court: \"Freedom of the press is both qualitative and quantitative. Freedom lies both in circulation and in content.\"23 (h) INDIAN EXPRESS Several newspapers filed writ petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the notifications issued by the Centre imposing from March 1, 1981, specified rates of customs duty and auxiliary duty on newsprint imported by different categories of newspapers. The levy was challenged in the Supreme Court. The main plea of the petitioners was that the impugned levy of duty on imported newsprint was excessive and had the direct effect of crippling the freedom of speech and expression and the carrying on of the business of publishing newspapers as it had led to an increase in the price of newspapers resulting in reduction of their circulation. The Supreme Court accepted the plea of the newspapers with the following observation:24 \"What may, however, have to be observed in levying a tax on newspaper industry is that it should not be an overburden on newspapers which constitute the Fourth Estate of the country. Nor should it single out newspaper industry for harsh Page 1138 treatment. A wise administrator should realise that the imposition of a tax like the customs duty on newsprint is an imposition on knowledge and would virtually amount to a burden on a man for being literate.\" The fundamental principle involved was the \"people's right to know\". Freedom of speech and expression should, therefore, receive a generous support from all those who believe in the participation of the people in the administration. The Court noted that with a view to checking malpractices interfering with the free flow of information, democratic constitutions the world over make provisions guaranteeing freedom of speech and expression and laying down the limits of interference therewith. It is, therefore, the primary duty of all national Courts to uphold this freedom and invalidate all laws or administrative actions which interfere with this freedom, contrary to the constitutional mandate. The Court pointed out that the imposition of customs duty on newsprint amounts to an imposition of tax on knowledge and virtually amounts to a burden imposed on a man for being literate and for being conscious of his duty as a citizen to inform himself of the world around him. It is on account of the special interest which society has in the freedom of speech and expression that the approach of the government must be more cautious while levying taxes on matters concerning newspaper industry than while levying taxes on other matters. But instead of quashing the impugned notification itself, the Court directed the Government to consider within six months the entire question of levy of import duty or auxiliary duty on newsprint with effect from March 1, 1981. If on such reconsideration, the government decided to modify the levy of the duty, it should take necessary steps to that end. Quashing the impugned notifications would have led to the petitioners paying much higher duty and the result would have been disastrous to them. The Court emphasized that it did not wish the Government to be deprived of the legitimate duty which the petitioners would have to pay on the imported newsprint. The Court thus rejected the plea of the petitioners that no duty could be levied on the newspaper industry. Having regard to the facilities like telephones, teleprinters, postal, transport and other communication amenities provided by the state at considerable cost to itself, the newspapers \"have to bear the common fiscal burden like the others.\" However, such a levy was \"subject to review by Courts in the light of the provisions of the Constitution.\"25 The Court has to reconcile the social interest involved in the freedom of speech and expression with the public interest involved in the fiscal levies imposed by the Government specially because newsprint constitutes the body, if expression happens to be the soul. Underlining the importance of the freedom of the press in democratic society, the Court has stated that in to-day's free world, freedom of press is the heart of social and political intercourse. The purpose of the press is to advance the public interest by publishing facts and opinions without which a democratic electorate cannot make responsible judgments. With a view to checking malpractices interfering with the free flow of information, democratic constitutions all the world over make provisions guaranteeing the freedom of speech and expression and laying down the limits of interference with it. \"It is, therefore, the primary duty of all the national Courts to uphold the said freedom and invalidate all laws or administrative actions which interfere with it contrary to the constitutional mandate.\"26 (i) HINDUSTAN TIMES Executive orders issued by State Government under Art. 162 directing deduction of an amount of 5% from the bills payable to newspapers having circulation of more than 25,00 copies for publication of government advertisements for implementation of its \"Pension and Social Security Scheme for Full time Journalists\" has been held to be ultra vires. The Court observed that advertisements in newspapers play an important role in the matter of revenue of the newspapers and have a direct nexus with its circulation by making the newspapers available to the readers at a price at which they can afford and they have no other option but to collect more funds by publishing commercial and other advertisements and as such the State cannot, in view of the equality doctrine contained in Article 14 of the Constitution, resort to the theory of \"take it or leave it\".",

    "content": "executive action which operates to the prejudice of any person must have the sanction of law and the executive cannot interfere with the rights and liabilities of any person unless the legality thereof is supportable in any Court of law.27 Page 1139 (j) OTHER ASPECTS OF THE FREEDOM OF PRESS The newspaper reporters can interview the prisoners condemned to death if they are willing to be interviewed. Unless, in a given case, there are weighty reasons for denying the opportunity to interview a condemned prisoner, the right of the press to interview the prisoners should not be denied. The reasons for denying the interview should be recorded in writing.28 In the instant case, the President had declined to commute the death sentence to life imprisonment; the convicted prisoners were willing to be interviewed. Accordingly, the Court ruled that the denial of right to the petitioner press reporter to interview these condemned prisoners, in the absence of any weighty considerations, was not justified. Again in M. Hasan v. State of Andhra Pradesh, 29 the Andhra Pradesh High Court has held that denial of permission to a press reporter to interview a willing condemned prisoner on a ground not falling within Art. 19(2) is not valid. \"Any such denial is deprivation of a citizen's Fundamental Right of freedom of speech and expression\". Convicts are not wholly denuded of their Fundamental Rights. During the course of a trial of a suit for damages, the judge ordered that the evidence of a witness should not be published in the newspapers. The Supreme Court rejected the plea that the order infringed the Fundamental Right of a press reporter under Art. 19(1)(a). The Court observed that, as a judicial decision purports to decide the controversy between the parties before the Court and nothing more, a judicial verdict pronounced by a Court in relation to a matter brought before it for its decision would not affect the right of citizens under Art. 19(1).30 An Act31 enacted to regulate conditions of service of employees of newspaper establishments, e.g., gratuity, hours of work, leave, wages, etc. does not violate Art. 19(1)(a). An argument against its validity was that it would adversely affect the financial position of the marginally situated newspapers which might be forced to close down and thus the tendency of the Act was to curtail circulation, which violated Art. 19(1)(a). The Court held, on the other hand, that the press had no immunity from general laws like tax or industrial laws. The purpose of the Act was to ameliorate the conditions of the workmen in the newspaper industry. The burden on marginally viable newspapers was an extraneous consequence or incidental disadvantage and not what the legislature aimed at in enacting the measure. The burden on the industry was remote which might or might not come about, and unless the burden was the direct and inevitable consequence of the Act itself, it could not be held invalid under Art. 19(1)(a).32 The press is not immune from taxation or general labour laws or civil or criminal laws. The prohibition is upon the imposition of any restriction directly relatable to the right to publish, to the right to disseminate information and to the circulation of newspapers.33 It is not inconsistent with Art. 19(1)(a) for the Central Government to appoint a committee to enquire into the economics of the newspaper industry.34 A legal provision requiring printing of the name of the printer, place of printing, name of the publisher and the place of publication on every paper or book does not infringe Art. 19(1)(a) for the intention of the provision is to inform the public as to who the printer or publisher is.35 Under S. 99A,Cr. P.C., a State Government can forfeit any book or newspaper if it appears it to contain any seditious matter, or matter intended to promote feelings of enmity or hatred between different classes of citizens, or matter intended to outrage the religious feelings of a class of citizens. The aggrieved party can move the High Court against the order of forefeiture. The provision has been held valid under Art. 19(2) as having been made in the interest of public order, decency or morality.36 Reliance Petrochemicals undertook a mega issue of debentures worth more than Rs. 500 crores. Suits and writ petitions were filed in various Courts seeking injunction against the said public issue. On an application by Reliance, the Supreme Court transferred all these cases to itself for decision, and also made an ex parte direction that the issue of debentures should go on \"without let or hindrance\". The Indian Express published an article questioning the validity of the consent given by the Controller of Capital Issues to the issue in question. Reliance secured from the Supreme Court an order of injunction prohibiting the newspaper from Page 1140 publishing anything questioning the legality or validity of the issue of debentures--a matter which at the time was sub judice. The debentures were over-subscribed though not allotted yet when the concerned newspaper sought vacation of the Court's order against it. Reliance opposed vacation of the injunction at that stage on the ground that before allotment was made, the subscribers could withdraw their applications which might adversely affect the issue and so they pleaded that \"the danger still persists\". The newspaper argued that pre-stoppage of newspaper publication on matters of public importance was contrary to the freedom of the press enshrined in the Constitution. The Supreme Court adopted the test laid down in Anita Whitney v. California37 that there must be reasonable ground to believe that the danger apprehended was \"real and imminent\". Brandeis, J., has said in Whitney that the fact that speech was likely to result in some violence or in destruction of property was not enough to justify its suppression. There must be probability of serious injury to the state. In Reliance Petrochemicals Ltd. v. Indian Express, 38 the Court has underscored the right of the people to know.",

    "content": "J., has said in Whitney that the fact that speech was likely to result in some violence or in destruction of property was not enough to justify its suppression. There must be probability of serious injury to the state. In Reliance Petrochemicals Ltd. v. Indian Express, 38 the Court has underscored the right of the people to know. The Court has pointed out that in the instant case it had to balance two interests of great public importance-freedom of speech and administration of justice. \"A balance, in our opinion, has to be struck between the requirements of free press and free trial...\" The Court has observed in this regard:39 \"We must see whether there is a present and imminent danger for the continuance of the injunction ...... It is necessary to reiterate that the continuance of this injunction would amount to interference with the freedom of press in the form of preventive injunction and it must, therefore, be based on reasonable grounds for the sole purpose of keeping the administration of justice unimpaired... We must remember that the people at large have a right to know in order to be able to take part in a participatory development in the industrial life and democracy. Right to know is a basic right which citizens of a free country aspire in the broaden horizon of the right to live in this age on our land under Art. 21 of the Constitution. That right has reached new dimensions and urgency. That right puts greater responsibility upon those who take upon the responsibility to inform.\"40 The Court thus ordered that there was no longer any need to continue the injunction. \"Preventive remedy in the form of an injunction is no longer necessary.\" Of course, the Court has pointed out that if any article written in the newspaper comes in the way of administration of justice by the Court in the instant case, there would always be available the concept of contempt of Court to take care of such an eventuality. In Dainik Sambad v. Tripura, 41Gauhati High Court has considered another matter of significance to the freedom of press. Does discriminatory allotment by Government of its advertisements among the various newspapers in the same category impair the freedom of press and the right to equality? The State had argued in the instant case that it was not bound to give advertisements to the petitioner newspaper equally with other newspapers as it had raised communal frenzy through its editorials, refused to publish Government contradictions and had always been critical of the Government. Rejecting the argument, the High Court pointed out that the fundamental principle involved here was the people's right to know. The Court laid emphasis upon the importance of freedom of press in strengthening an individual's participation in the decision-making process by the Government as the Supreme Court has emphasized in Indian Express.42 In sum, \"the fundamental principle involved here is the people's right to know.\"43 Freedom of press should receive a generous support from all those who believe in the participation of the people in the administration. Thus, the society has an interest in the freedom of press. In the instant case, the High Court directed the State to distribute its advertisements equally among all newspapers including the petitioner. The Court said: \"Such power should not be used on the newspaper establishment so as to make the establishment subservient to the Government.\" To the same effect is Sushil Choudhury v. Tripura, 44 where the High Court has stated that discriminatory allocation of government advertisements among the newspapers adversely affects freedom of speech and expression as it may result in reduction of circulation of these newspapers which get less advertisement. A large number of newspaper readers are interested in government advertisements. Such readers may prefer to subscribe to those newspapers which have government advertisements. If a newspaper gains in circulation, it comes to have a great influence on the public mind, and this strikes at the very foundation of the freedom of speech and expression. Page 1141 In Rajgopal45, the question was how far the press could criticise and comment on the acts and conduct of public officials. The Supreme Court felt that freedom of the press extends to engaging in uninhibited debate about the involvement of public figures in public issues and events. But, as regards their private life, a proper balancing of freedom of the press as well as the right of privacy and defamation has to be done in terms of the democratic way of life laid down in the Constitution. The Supreme Court has ruled that neither the State nor its officers have any authority in law to impose any prior restraint on publication of any material in the press on the ground that it is defamatory of the State or its officers. Their remedy arises only after publication by way of suit for damages for defamation. (k) ADVERTISEMENTS How far are advertisements protected under Art. 19(1)(a)? The Supreme Court has considered this question in Hamdard Dawakhana v. Union of India .46 Parliament enacted an Act with a view to control advertisements of drugs in certain cases. The Act was challenged on the ground that restriction on advertisements was a direct abridgment of the freedom of expression. The Court ruled that the predominant object of the Act was not merely to curb advertisements offending against decency or morality, but also to prevent self-medication by prohibiting instruments which might be used to advocate or spread the evil. The Court stated that an advertisement, no doubt, is a form of speech, but its true character is to be determined by the object which it seeks to promote. It may amount to an expression of ideas and propagation of human thought and, thus, would fall within the scope of Art. 19(1)(a).",

    "content": "may amount to an expression of ideas and propagation of human thought and, thus, would fall within the scope of Art. 19(1)(a). But a commercial advertisement having an element of trade and commerce and promoting business has an element of trade and commerce, and it no longer falls within the concept of freedom of speech for its object is not to propagate any ideas--social, political or economic or to further literature or human thought. An advertisement promoting drugs and commodities, the sale of which is not in public interest, could not be regarded as propagating any idea and, as such, could not claim the protection of Art. 19(1)(a). An advertisement meant to further business falls within the concept of trade or commerce. A commercial advertisement advertising an individual's business cannot be regarded as a part of freedom of speech. But the Supreme Court has modified its view expressed in Hamdard Dawakhana somewhat in later cases. In Sakal47 and BennettColeman,48 the Supreme Court has dilated upon the great significance of advertisement revenue for the economy of newspapers. In Indian Express Newspapers,49 differing from Hamdard Dawakhana ruling, the Court has observed: \"We are of the view that all commercial advertisements cannot be denied the protection of Art. 19(1)(a) of the Constitution merely because they are issued by business men\". Advertising pays large portion of the costs of supplying the public with newspapers. \"For a democratic press the advertising \"subsidy\" is crucial\". With the curtailment in advertisements, the price of newspaper will be forced up and this will adversely affect its circulation and this will be a direct interference with the right of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Art. 19(1)(a). Reading Hamdard Dawakhana and Indian Express together, the Supreme Court has concluded in Tata Press50 that \"commercial speech\" cannot be denied the protection of Art. 19(1)(a) merely because the same is issued by businessmen. \"Commercial speech\" is a part of freedom of speech guaranteed under Art. 19(1)(a). The public at large has a right to receive the \"commercial speech\". Art 19(1)(a) protects the rights of an individual \"to listen, read and receive\" the \"commercial speech\". The protection of Art 19(1)(a) is available both to the speaker as well as the recipient of the speech. Advertising is a 'commercial speech' which has two facets: (1) Advertising which is no more than a commercial transaction, nonetheless, disseminates information regarding the product advertised. Public at large stands benefited by the information made available through advertisement. In a democratic economy, free flow of commercial information is indispensable. Therefore, any curtailment of advertisement would affect the Fundamental Right under Art 19(1)(a) on the aspects of propagation, publication and Page 1142 circulation. (2) The public at large has a right to receive commercial information. Art 19(1)(a) protects the right of an individual to listen, read and receive the said speech. The protection of Art. 19(1)(a) is available to the speaker as well as the recipient of the speech. In Tata, the Supreme Court accepted as valid the printing of yellow pages by the Tata Press. Printing of a directory of telephone subscribers is to be done exclusively by the Telephone Department as a part of its service to the telephone subscribers. But yellow pages only contain commercial advertisements and Art. 19(1)(a) guarantee freedom to publish the same. Reference may be made here to a few foreign cases having a bearing on the freedom of the press. In New York Times v. Sullivan, 51 the facts were as follows: In 1960, the New York times carried a full page paid advertisement sponsored by the 'Committee to Defend Martin Luther King and the Struggle for Freedom in the South', which asserted or implied that law enforcement officials in Montgomery, Alabama, had improperly arrested and harassed Dr. King and other civil rights demonstrators on various occasions. The respondent, who was the elected Police Commissioner of Montgomery, brought an action for libel against the Times and several of the individual signatories to the advertisement. It was found that some of the assertions contained in the advertisement were inaccurate. The State Court awarded damages against the newspaper, but the U.S. Supreme Court reversed. Brennan, J., stated: \"Authoritative interpretations of the First Amendment guarantees have consistently refused to recognize an exception for any test of truth--whether administered by judges, juries, or administrative officials--and especially one that puts the burden of proving the truth on the speaker...... A rule compelling the critic of official conduct to guarantee the truth of all his factual assertions--and to do so on pain of libel judgments virtually unlimited in amount--leads to... \"self-censorship\". Allowance of the defense of truth, with the burden of proving it on the defendant, does not mean that only false speech will be deterred.... Under such a rule, would- be critics of official conduct may be deterred from voicing their criticism, even though it is believed to be true and even though it is in fact true, because of doubt whether it can be proved in Court or fear of the expenses of having to do so. They tend to make only statements which \"steer far wider of the unlawful zone.\".... The rule thus dampens the vigor and limits the variety of public debate. It is inconsistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The constitutional guarantees require, we think, a federal rule that prohibits a public official from recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he proves that the statement was made with \"actual malice\"--that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard to whether it was false or not...\" In Derbyshire County Council v. Times Newspapers Ltd., 52 the House of Lords ruled that a local authority could not sue the press for libel. The Lords held that there is no public interest in allowing government institutions to sue for liable; it is \"contrary to the public interest because to admit such actions would place an undesirable fetter on freedom of speech\".",

    "content": "Lords held that there is no public interest in allowing government institutions to sue for liable; it is \"contrary to the public interest because to admit such actions would place an undesirable fetter on freedom of speech\". In Leonard Hector v. Att. Gen. of Antiqua and Berbuda, 53 the Privy Council has observed: \"In a free democratic society it is almost too obvious to need stating that those who hold office in government and who are responsible for public administration must always be open to criticism. Any attempt to stifle or fetter such criticism amounts to political censorship of the most insidious and objectionable kind. At the same time it is no less obvious that the very purpose of criticism levelled at those who have the conduct of public affairs by their political opponents is to undermine public confidence in their stewardship and to persuade the electorate that the opponents would make a better job of it than those presently holding office. In the light of these considerations their Lordships cannot help viewing a statutory provision which criminalises statements likely to undermine public confidence in the conduct of public affairs with the utmost suspicion.\" The question is how far the principles stated in the above cases are applicable in India. The Supreme Court has answered this question as follows:54 \"So far as the freedom of press is concerned, it flows from the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a). But the said right is subject to reasonable restrictions placed thereon by an existing law or a law made after Page 1143 the commencement of the Constitution in the interests of or in relation to the several matters set out therein. Decency and defamation are two of the grounds mentioned in clause (2). Law of Torts providing for damages for invasion of the right to privacy and defamation and sections 499/ 500, I.P.C. are the existing laws saved under clause (2). But what is called for today--in the present times--is a proper balancing of the freedom of press and said laws consistent with the democratic way of life ordained by the Constitution. Over the last few decades, press and electronic media have emerged as major factors in our nation's life. They are still expanding--and in the process becoming more inquisitive. Our system of government demands--as do the systems of Government of the United States of America and United Kingdom--constant vigilance over exercise of governmental power by the press and the media among others. It is essential for a good Government. At the same time, we must remember that our society may not share the degree of public awareness obtaining in United Kingdom or United States. The sweep of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and the freedom of speech and expression under our Constitution is not identical though similar in their major premises. All this may call for some modification of the principles emerging from the English and United States decisions in their application to our legal system.\" One principle which the Court did lay down is that the State or its officers cannot impose any prior restraint or prohibition on any publication because they apprehend that they may be defamed. Their remedy, if any, would arise only after the publication.55 (l) PICKETING, DEMONSTRATION AND STRIKE Within certain limits, picketing or demonstration may be regarded as the manifestation of one's freedom of speech and expression. \"Peaceful picketing is free speech. Non violent acts are like words.\" Picketing or demonstration is a non-violent act of persuasion.56 In V. Vengan,57 picketing a North-Indian shop and dissuading intending customers from purchasing in that shop was held to be not warranted by Art. 19(1)(a). Art. 15(1) prohibits discrimination on the ground of place of birth,58 and if the State Legislature were to pass an Act forbidding South Indians to purchase from North Indian shops, such an Act would be unconstitutional. Therefore, the picketing and the propaganda in question contained an unconstitutional germ in support of which the Constitution could not be invoked. The conduct of the petitioner, if carried to its extreme conclusion, would undermine the security of the State by creating disaffection and ultimately strife and hatred between South Indians and North Indians residing and doing business in the South. As regards government servants, the judicial view appears to be that while banning demonstrations by them is not valid, a strike by them can be validly prohibited. A rule made by the Bihar Government prohibited government servants from participating in any demonstration or strike in connection with any matter pertaining to their conditions of service. The rule was challenged. The Supreme Court said that a government servant does not, by accepting government service, lose his Fundamental Rights under Art. 19. A demonstration, held the Court, is a visible manifestation of the feelings or sentiments of an individual or a group. It is thus a communication of one's ideas to others and is in effect a form of speech or expression, because speech need not be vocal since signs made by a dumb person would also be a form of speech and expression. Accordingly, certain forms of demonstration would fall under Art. 19(1)(a). In the instant case, the government justified the rule as being in the interests of 'public order'. Nevertheless, the Court declared the rule bad as it banned every type of demonstration howsoever innocent, and did not confine itself to those forms of demonstrations only which might lead to a breach of public tranquillity, or would fall under the other limiting criteria specified in Art. 19(2). However, the rule was not held bad in so far as it prohibited a strike, for there was no Fundamental Right to resort to strike.59 Again, in O.K. Ghosh v. E.X. Joseph, 60 a disciplinary rule prohibited government servants from participating in any demonstration. The Court held the rule to be invalid.",

    "content": "However, the rule was not held bad in so far as it prohibited a strike, for there was no Fundamental Right to resort to strike.59 Again, in O.K. Ghosh v. E.X. Joseph, 60 a disciplinary rule prohibited government servants from participating in any demonstration. The Court held the rule to be invalid. The Court emphasized that the rule could be valid if it imposed a reasonable restriction in the interests of public order. The Court did however emphasize that government servants are subject to the rules of discipline which are intended to maintain discipline among them and to lead to an efficient discharge of their duties. The above-stated principle has been reiterated by the Court in other cases as well. S. 3 of the Essential Services Maintenance Ordinance, 1960, authorised the Central Government to prohibit any strike in any essential service in the public interest. Going on a prohibited strike became illegal and punishable with Page 1144 imprisonment. The provision was declared valid as it did not curtail freedom of speech and there was no Fundamental Right to go on a strike.61 (m) BANDH In a landmark decision in Bharat Kumar,62 a full Bench of the Kerala High Court has declared \"Bandhs\" organised by political parties from time to time as unconstitutional being violative of the Fundamental Rights of the people. The Court refused to accept it as an exercise of the freedom of speech and expression by the concerned party calling for the bandh. When a bandh is called, people are expected not to travel, not to carry on their trade, not to attend to their work. A threat is held out either expressly or impliedly that any attempt to go against the call for bandh may result in physical injury. A call for bandh is clearly different from a call for general strike or hartal. There is destruction of public property during a bandh. Accordingly, the High Court has directed that a call for a bandh by any association, organisation or political party and enforcing of that call by it, is illegal and unconstitutional. The High Court has also directed the State and all its law enforcement agencies to do all that may be necessary to give effect to the Court order. The Supreme Court has dismissed an appeal against the above-mentioned High Court decision. The Supreme Court refused to interfere with the High Court decision. The Court has accepted the distinction drawn by the High Court between a 'bandh' and a strike. A bandh interferes with the exercise of the Fundamental Freedoms of other citizens, in addition to causing national loss in many ways. The Fundamental Rights of the people as a whole cannot be regarded as subservient to a claim of Fundamental Right of an individual, or of a section of the people.63 The Supreme Court has now declared the reason why bandh should be banned. In the name of hartal or bandh or strike no person has any right to cause inconvenience to any other person or to cause in any manner a threat or apprehension of risk to life, liberty and property of any citizen or destruction of life and property, and the least to any government or public property. The Supreme Court pointed out that it was high time that the authorities concerned took serious note of this requirement while dealing with those who destroy public property in the name of strike, hartal or bandh. Any soft or lenient approach for such offenders would be an affront to the rule of law and challenge to public order and peace.64 In Ranchi Bar Association v. State of Bihar, 65 following the Apex Court decision, mentioned above, the Patna High Court has ruled that no party has a right to organise a bandh causing/compelling the people by force to stop them from exercising their lawful activities. The government is duty bound to prevent unlawful activities like bandh which invades people's life, liberty and property. The government is bound to pay compensation to those who suffer loss of life, liberty or property as a result of a bandh because of the failure of the government to discharge its public duty to protect them. In appropriate cases, even the organisers of the bandh may be directed to pay compensation. Any organization interfering with the functioning of the Courts commits contempt of Court and can be punished accordingly. A peaceful strike which does not interfere with the rights and properties of the people is however not illegal. In the instant case, the High Court did award compensation against the State Government for loss of property and death of a person during the bandh for failure of the authorities to take appropriate action and provide adequate protection to the people's life, liberty and property. The Government failed to discharge its public duty to protect the people during the bandh. (n) RIGHT TO TRAVEL ABROAD An interesting question considered in Maneka was whether the right to travel abroad could be regarded as a part of Arts. 19(1)(a) and (g).66 The right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(a) is exerciseable not only in India but outside as well. According to Bhagwati, J., state action taken in India may impair or restrict the exercise of this right elsewhere. For example, a journalist may be prevented from sending his dispatches abroad. The same applies by parity to Art. 19(1)(g). But the Court refused to accept the argument, that the right to travel abroad was an 'essential part' of the freedoms guaranteed by Arts. Page 1145 19(1)(a) and (g) so that whenever the former was violated, the latter would also be impaired. The right to travel abroad is not specifically named as a Fundamental Right in Art. 19(1). But a right not named expressly may still be covered by some clause in Art.",

    "content": "right to travel abroad is not specifically named as a Fundamental Right in Art. 19(1). But a right not named expressly may still be covered by some clause in Art. 19, if it \"is an integral part of a named Fundamental Right or partakes of the same basic nature and character as the named Fundamental Right so that the exercise of such right is in reality and substance nothing but an instance of the exercise of the named Fundamental Right\".67 Judged by this test, the right to travel abroad is not an integral part of the rights under Art. 19(1)(a) or (g), but only a concomitant or peripheral right to these rights. S. 10(3)(c) of the Passport Act which authorises imposition of restrictions on the right to go abroad by impounding of passport, could not, therefore, be held void under Art. 19(1)(a) or (g). But this does not mean that an order made under S. 10(3)(c), Passport Act, may not violate Art. 19(1)(a) or (g) under any circumstances. There may be situations when denial of the right to travel abroad may have a direct and inevitable effect to abridge or take away the freedom of speech and expression, or the right to carry on a profession or business. In the words of Bhagwati, J.:68 \"... There may be many such cases where the restriction imposed is apparently only on the right to go abroad but the direct and inevitable consequence is to interfere with the freedom of speech and expression or the right to carry on a profession. A musician may want to go abroad to sing, a dancer to dance, a visiting professor to teach and a scholar to participate in a conference or seminar. If in such a case his passport is denied or impounded, it would directly interfere with his freedom of speech and expression... Examples can be multiplied, but the point of the matter is that though the right to go abroad is not a Fundamental Right, the denial of the right to go abroad may, in truth and in effect, restrict freedom of speech and expression or freedom to carry on a profession...\" When a right under Art. 19(1)(a) or (g) is infringed, impounding of the passport would have to be justified under Art. 19(2) or (6). In that case, the expression 'in the interests of the general public' in S. 10(3)(c) will have to be read down to mean 'public order, decency or morality' [words used in Art. 19(2)],69 if there is a violation of the right under Art. 19(1)(a). Then impounding of a passport for an indefinite length of time would amount to an unreasonable restriction under Arts. 19(2) and (6). Bhagwati, J., however, cautioned the Passport Authority that the power to refuse or impound a passport should not be exercised lightly as it is a basic human right recognised in Art. 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; it is a valuable right, a part of personal liberty with which the authority seeks to interfere. (o) TELEPHONE TAPPING The freedom of speech and expression means the right to express one's convictions and opinions freely by word of mouth, writing, printing, picture, or in any other manner. When a person is talking on telephone, he is exercising his right to freedom of speech and expression. Telephone tapping, accordingly, infracts Art. 19(1)(a) unless it falls within the grounds of restrictions falling under Art. 19(2).70 The Court also treated it as an aspect of privacy and invoked Art. 21 against telephone tapping.71 (p) SOME MISCELLANEOUS SITUATIONS When a professor was suspended by the university concerned, and later on an enquiry was set up against him on the allegation that he had made derogatory remarks against the Prime Minister, it was held that Art. 19(1)(a) could not protect him against such an inquiry.72 Carrying of letters written by others against payment does not fall within Art. 19(1)(a).73 A condition imposed on cinema exhibitors to show about 200 ft. of educational films, or films dealing with news and current affairs, or documentary films, has been held to be not inconsistent with Art. 19(1)(a). This is a means of communication and propagation of scientific ideas and the like.74 An argument raised against the impugned provision was that just as a restraint on free speech is a violation Page 1146 of Art. 19(1)(a) [except as permitted under Art. 19(2)] compelled speech, often known as a \"must carry\" provision in a statute, is equally an infringement of the right to free speech, except to the extent permitted under Art. 19(2). The Court countered this argument by stating that whether compelled speech will or will not amount to a violation of the freedom of speech and expression, \"will depend on the nature of a 'must carry' provision.\" If it furthers informed decision-making which is the essence of the right to free speech and expression, it will not amount to any violation of the Fundamental Freedom of speech and expression. If, however, such a provision compels a person to carry out propaganda, or project a partisan or distorted point of view, contrary to his wish, it may amount to a restraint on his freedom of speech and expression. Justifying the provision in question, the Court has observed: \"The social context of any such legislation cannot be ignored. When a substantially significant population body is illiterate or does not have easy access to ideas or information, it is important that all available means of communication, particularly audio visual communication, are utilised not just for entertainment but also for education, information, propagation of scientific ideas and the like\". The provision in question does not require the cinema exhibitor to show a propaganda film, or a film conveying the views which he objects to. Levy of an entertainment tax on cable operators has been held to be valid. Their activities have two aspects--business and speech.",

Levy of an entertainment tax on cable operators has been held to be valid. Their activities have two aspects--business and speech. There is no reason why the business part cannot be taxed when a similar tax is levied on cinema shows. \"Where the freedom of speech gets intertwined with business, it undergoes a fundamental change and its exercise has to be balanced against social interests....while there can be no tax on the right to exercise freedom of expression, tax is leviable on profession, occupation, trade, business and industry\".75 (q) LIFE INSURANCE CORPORATION The Consumer Education and Research Centre published a study entitled \"A Fraud On Policyholders\". It was a scientific research made into the working of the Life Insurance Corporation. This study tried to portray and establish the discriminatory practices which the Corporation was alleged to have adopted and which adversely affected a large number of policy holders, their investment policies, their expense ratio, availability of term insurance and other cognate matters. The Director of the Corporation wrote a reply to it. His reply was published in The Hindu. In that reply, he tried to challenge the conclusions recorded in the study prepared by the Centre. The Director's reply was also published by the Corporation in 'Yogakshema', a journal run by the Corporation. On a scientific and studied basis, the Executive Trustee of the Centre (petitioner) rejoined the Director and replied to his reply. Since Yogakshema had published the Director's reply, the petitioner requested the Corporation to publish his reply also in Yogakshema. The Corporation refused to do so. In these circumstances, the Gujarat High Court ruled in the case noted below76 that the action of the Corporation was violative of the petitioner's Fundamental Rights under Art. 19(1)(a) and Art. 14. The Corporation is a public body and belongs to no individual. Therefore, the considerations which govern the case of an individual do not apply to a statutory public body. Every citizen has a right to demand of the State to make available to him a particular channel or channels for publishing his studied criticism of the concerned branch of public administration. To make such an opportunity available to an admirer and to deny it to a critic is to deny to him his freedom of speech and expression and to throttle democracy. In a democratic polity, though people may not directly participate in governmental working or public administration, they have a right to demand of those who are in charge of their destiny for the time being how they deal with the problems which they are facing. A Corporation which carries on the business of life insurance in the shape of a statutory monopoly is answerable to the people of India with whose funds it deals and to whose welfare it claims to cater. \"The Corporation is a public body and belongs to no individual.\" Article 19(1) (a) embraces within its sweep both acts of omission and commission which curtail or abridge Page 1147 the freedom of speech and expression, subject to the reasonable restrictions contemplated by Art. 19(2). The Corporation is obligated to publish a studied criticism of its activities and a citizen has a right to express through the medium of such Corporation his studied criticisms of its activities. By spending public funds on publishing only what is appreciative of its activities and by refusing to publish a critical study of its activities, the Corporation will only assume the guardianship of public mind. This cannot be allowed because of Art. 19(1)(a). If the official Gazette publishes a studied criticism of someone's study without publishing the original article or study, it is under an obligation to publish a studied reply to such a criticism which is the study of a problem. Assuming that All India Radio or Doordarshan publishes something which is a reply to someone's study or is a criticism of someone's studied article by naming that person, it is under an obligation to publish a studied reply to it. The Court rejected the claim made by the Corporation to the editorial privilege and absolute discretion to publish or not to publish an article as being inconsistent with the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The Court also rejected as untenable the contention that 'Yogakshema' was a house magazine and not a mass media. Merely because it is interested in a particular subject-matter and happens to find its circulation amongst officers, employees and agents of the Corporation, it does not attain the character of a house magazine. Under the pretext and guise of publishing a house magazine, the Corporation cannot violate the Fundamental Rights of the petitioner. A house magazine cannot claim any privilege against the Fundamental Rights of a citizen. The Court also held it against Art. 14 to make available public funds to an admirer and not to a sober critic. Both have an equal place in the social order and both must be treated equally and alike. Thus, refusal to the petitioner to make 'Yogakshema' available for voicing his studied criticism violated Art. 14. The matter then came before Supreme Court in Life Insurance Corporation of India v. Manubhai D. Shah .77 The Supreme Court has stated in this case that a liberal interpretation should be given to the right of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(a). The Court has characterised this right as a \"basic human right\". This right includes \"the right to propagate one's views through the print media or through any other communication channel, e.g. the radio and television\". Thus, every citizen \"has the right to air his or her views through the print and/or the electronic media subject, of course, to permissible restrictions imposed under Art. 19(2) of the Constitution\".78 In the instant case, the Supreme Court has taken cognisance of two situations.",

Thus, every citizen \"has the right to air his or her views through the print and/or the electronic media subject, of course, to permissible restrictions imposed under Art. 19(2) of the Constitution\".78 In the instant case, the Supreme Court has taken cognisance of two situations. One, the respondent circulated a research article suggesting that the LIC was charging unduly high premiums from those who took out life insurance policies. The LIC published a counter reply to this paper in a daily newspaper and also in its own in-house magazine Yogakshema. The respondent then prepared a rejoinder and got it printed in the same daily newspaper. He also wanted the LIC to print his rejoinder in Yogakshema, but the LIC refused to do so. The Supreme Court was called upon to decide the question whether the LIC was right in refusing to publish the rejoinder by the respondent in Yogakshema. Answering in the negative, the Court pointed out that the attitude of the LIC was both \"unfair and unreasonable\"--unfair because fairness demanded that both view points were placed before the readers and unreasonable because there was no justification for refusing publication. By refusing to print and publish the rejoinder the LIC had violated the respondent's Fundamental Right. Every free citizen has an undoubted right to lay what sentiments he pleases before the public. Freedom of speech and expression is subject only to the restrictions imposable under Art. 19(2). Efforts by intolerant authorities to curb or suffocate this freedom must be firmly repelled, more so when public authorities betray autocratic, tendencies. LIC is a 'state' within the meaning of Art. 12.79The LIC Act enacted by Parliament requiresLIC to function in the best interest of the community. The community is, therefore, entitled to know whether or not, this requirement of the statute is being satisfied in the functioning of the LIC. (r) TELEVISION The other situation dealt with by the Supreme Court in the instant case arose out of the Doordarshan's Page 1148 refusal to telecast a documentary film on Bhopal gas tragedy prepared by the petitioner. The film in question had won the golden lotus award as the best non-feature film in 1987 and yet the Doordarshan refused to telecast the film on the ground that \"the contents being outdated do not have relevance now for the telecast.\" The Supreme Court has ruled that a film maker has a Fundamental Right under Art. 19(1)(a) to exhibit his film and, therefore, the party which claims that it is entitled to refuse enforcement of this right by virtue of law made under Art. 19(2), is under an onus to show that the film does not conform to the requirements of the law. The Court has emphasized that the words \"freedom of speech and expression in Art. 19(1)(a) must be broadly interpreted so as to include the freedom to circulate one's views by words of mouth or in writing or through audio-visual instrumentalities, like radio and television, subject, of course, to permissible restrictions imposed under Art. 19(2). \"The print media, the radio and the tiny screen play the role of public educators, so vital to the growth of a healthy democracy\". Subject to reasonable restrictions placed under Art. 19(2), a citizen has a right to publish, circulate and disseminate his views and any attempt to thwart or deny the same would offend Art. 19(1)(a). Ultimately, the Court has rejected Doordarshan's reasons for not showing the film on the Television. The Court has stated concerning the film: \"To bring out the inadequacy of the State effort or the indifference of the officers, etc., cannot amount to an attack on any political party if the criticism is genuine and objective and made in good faith.\" Doordarshan being a state-controlled agency funded by public funds could not have denied access to screen except on valid grounds. In Ramesh,80 a writ petition was filed to restrain the screening of serial Tamason the television on the ground that it violated Arts. 21 and 25 of the Constitution as well as s. Sections 58 of the Cinematograph Act, 1952. The Court rejected the petition saying that the serial viewed in its entirety \"is capable of creating a lasting impression of the message of peace and co-existence...\" The Court quoted copiously from its earlier decision inAbbas.81 Odyssey,82 another case involving the Doordarshan, arose on appeal against a stay order issued by the Bombay High Court restraining telecasting of certain episodes of the serial Honi Anhonee. The question before the Supreme Court was whether these episodes should be prohibited from being telecast. Refusing to do so, the Court has pointed out that the right of a citizen to exhibit films on the Doordarshan, subject to the terms and conditions imposed by Doordarshan, is a part of the Fundamental Right of freedom of expression guaranteed under Art. 19(1)(a) which can be curtailed only under circumstances set out in Art. 19(2). A citizen's right to exhibit films on television \"is similar to the right of a citizen to publish his views through any other media such as newspapers, magazines, advertisements, hoardings etc., subject to the terms and conditions of the owners of the media.\" The episodes in question did not violate any law or any right of the petitioners nor was the serial likely to affect prejudicially the well being of the people. The showing of these episodes was not likely to endanger public morality. The Court thus allowed the appeal. Commenting upon the issue of an interim injunction by the High Court, the Supreme Court stated that \"the High Court overlooked that the issue of an order of interim injunction in this case would infringe a Fundamental Right of the producer of the serial.\" Also, the Court has reserved its opinion on the question whether a citizen has a Fundamental Right to establish a private broadcasting station, or television centre.",

    "content": "the great value which the Court attaches to the of speech and expression, the Court has emphasized: \"Freedom of expression is a preferred right which is always very zealously guarded by this Court.\" The petitioner produced a documentary on violence and terrorism in Punjab. The film received a \"U\" certificate from the Board of Film Censors. Besides, it also received several international awards. Nevertheless, the Doordarshan refused to telecast the film. The Bombay High Court ruled that the refusal of Doordarshan to telecast the film was unjustified and amounted to violation of the petitioner's right under Art. 19(1)(a). It also amounted to violation of the right of the people under Art. 19(1)(a) to be informed and enlightened about the situation in Punjab. The Court emphasized that every person has a Fundamental Right to form his own opinion on any issue of general concern. The State cannot prevent open discussion and Page 1149 open expression of views however hateful to its policies. Restrictions on freedom of speech and expression can be imposed only under Art. 19(2) and not outside that provision. Accordingly, the Court directed the Doordarshan to exhibit the film on Channel I or II at a proper time.83 As the Supreme Court has emphasized, television plays a very important and significant role in modern life. Many people obtain the bulk of their information on matters of contemporary interest from the broadcasting medium. The combination of picture and voice makes it an irresistibly attractive medium of presentation. It exercises tremendous influence over millions of people. Freedom of speech and expression includes the right to receive information and ideas as well as freedom to impart them.84 During the course of recording of the interview of the petitioner for a T.V. programme pertaining to \"Laws relating to Women\" on the invitation of Doordarshan itself, she made critical remarks about a Bill which was then pending before Parliament as being violative of women's right to equality. When the programme was telecast, her views on the Bill were deleted. The petitioner in a writ petition asserted that this amounted to censorship of her views by the television authorities as her views were against the views of the ruling party. The Doordarshan authorities justified deletion on the basis that it only amounted to editing and not censorship. The High Court ruled in Indira Jai Singh v. Union of India85 that the deletion of her views was not by way of editing but by way of censorship. The interesting aspect of the High Court's decision is the ruling that the right of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(a), protects this freedom on the television as much as it does anywhere else. The Court has observed: \"A citizen who is interviewed over television by invitation of the television authorities is entitled to express his or her views freely. Censorship or deliberate distortion of these views would violate Art. 19. Any restriction of this right must be within the ambit of Art. 19(2) and by law.\" The Court held that the respondents restricted the petitioner's right under Art. 19(1)(a) arbitrarily and by an executive fiat. The Court has emphasized that the executive action restraining exercising of a right under Art. 19(1)(a) cannot be taken without any legislative authority. (s) CENSORSHIP OF FILMS In K.A. Abbas v. Union of India, 86 the Supreme Court has upheld censorship of films under Art. 19(1)(a) on the ground that films have to be treated separately from other forms of art and expression because a motion picture is able to stir up emotions more deeply than any other product of art. A film can therefore be censored on the grounds mentioned in Art. 19(2). Another case on film censorship is Rangarajan87 which came before the Supreme Court by way of appeal from the Madras High Court. In this case, the Supreme Court has considered the question of censorship of films vis-a-vis Art. 19(1)(a). The Court has justified pre-censorship of a film because it caters for mass audience, it has unique capacity to disturb and arouse feelings and has as much potential for evil as it has for good. A film cannot therefore be allowed to function in a free market place just as the newspapers or magazines do. Here was a film which criticised the reservation policy of the Tamil Nadu Government. While the Board of Film Censors certified the film as fit for showing, and granted it U certificate, the Madras High Court banned the film from being exhibited and cancelled the certificate as there was some public protest against the film. So, the matter came before the Supreme Court in appeal and the Court reversed the High Court and accepted the appeal. Emphasizing upon the concept of freedom of speech and expression, the Court has stated: \"Our commitment of freedom of expression demands that it cannot be suppressed unless the situations created by allowing the freedom are pressing and the community interest is endangered. The anticipated danger should not be remote, conjectural or far-fetched. It should have proximate and direct nexus with the expression. Page 1150 A film producer is entitled to project his own message which others may not approve of. Everyone has a Fundamental Right to form his own opinion on any issue of general concern. The State cannot prevent open discussion and open expression of views, however critical of its own views. At another place in the judgment, the Court has observed: \"In democracy it is not necessary that every one should sing the same song. Freedom of expression is the rule and it is generally taken for granted. Every one has a Fundamental Right to form his own opinion on any issue of general concern. He can form and inform by any legitimate means. The democracy is a Government by the people via open discussion.\" The Court has accepted that movies doubtless enjoy the guarantee under Art. 19(1)(a).",

    "content": "of expression is the rule and it is generally taken for granted. Every one has a Fundamental Right to form his own opinion on any issue of general concern. He can form and inform by any legitimate means. The democracy is a Government by the people via open discussion.\" The Court has accepted that movies doubtless enjoy the guarantee under Art. 19(1)(a). The State Government had pleaded for banning the exhibition of the film on the ground that otherwise there might arise a serious law and order situation in the State. To this plea, the Court has given a caustic reply as follows: \"What good is the protection of freedom of expression if the State does not take care to protect it? If the film is unobjectionable and cannot constitutionally be restricted under Art. 19(2), freedom of expression cannot be suppressed on account of threat of demonstration and processions or threats of violence .... It is the duty of the State to protect the freedom of expression since it is a liberty guaranteed against the State....\" The Court has emphasized that if the film is unobjectionable and cannot constitutionally be restricted under Art. 19(2), freedom of expression cannot be suppressed on account of threat of demonstration or threats of violence. That would tantamount to negation of the rule of law and a surrender to blackmail and intimidation. The State cannot plead its inability to handle the hostile audience problem. Freedom of expression which is legitimate and constitutionally protected cannot be held to ransom by an intolerant group of people. In the end, the Court has observed: \"The fundamental freedom under Art. 19(1)(a) can be reasonably restricted only for the purposes mentioned in Art. 19(2) and the restriction must be justified on the anvil of necessity and not the quicksand of convenience or expediency. Open criticism of Government policies and operations is not a ground for restricting expression. We must practice tolerance to the views of others. Intolerance is as much dangerous to democracy as to the person himself.\" The Delhi High Court directed certain excisions to be made from the film \"Bandit queen\". On appeal, the Supreme Court set aside the High Court's decision.88 (t) TELECASTING In Cricket Association,89 the Supreme Court has considered the significant question of freedom of telecasting vis-a-vis Art. 19(1)(a). In this case, the right of the Cricket Association to telecast the cricket match came up for consideration before the Supreme Court. Telecasting is a system of communication either audio or visual or both. Organisation of an event in India is an aspect of the freedom of speech and expression protected by Art. 19(1)(a) and reasonable restrictions can be imposed thereon under Art. 19(2). It therefore follows that organisation, production and recording of an event cannot be prevented except by a law permitted by Art. 19(2). Similarly, the publication or communication of the recorded event through the cassettes cannot be restricted or prevented except under a law made under Art. 19(2). The freedom to receive and communicate information and ideas without interference is an important aspect of the freedom of speech and expression under Art. 19(1)(a). Freedom of speech includes the right to propagate one's views through print media or through any other communication channel, e.g., radio and television. The right to impart and receive information is a species of freedom of speech. No monopoly of Page 1151 electronic media is permissible as Art. 19(2) does not permit state monopoly. Unlike the print media, there are certain built-in limitations on the use of electronic media, viz.: (i) the airwaves or frequencies are a public property and they have to be used for the benefit of the society at large; (ii) the frequencies are limited; (iii) the airwaves are owned or controlled by the Government or a central national authority; (iv) they are not available on account of the scarcity, costs and competition. Broadcasting is a means of communication, and, therefore, a medium of speech and expression. Hence, in a democratic society, neither any private body nor any governmental organisation can claim any monopoly over it. The Indian Constitution also forbids monopoly either in the print or electronic media. The Constitution only permits state monopoly in respect of a trade or business.90 The Government can however claim regulatory powers over broadcasting so as to utilize the public resources in the form of the limited frequencies available for the benefit of the society at large and to prevent concentration of the frequencies in the hands of the rich few who can then monopolise the dissemination of views and information to suit their interests. In democratic countries, this regulatory function is discharged by an independent autonomous broadcasting authority which is representative of all sections of the society and is free from state control. In this case, the Court has laid down the following three propositions: (1) The airwaves or frequencies are a public property. Their use has to be controlled and regulated by a public authority in the interest of the public and to prevent the invasion of their rights. Since the electronic media involves the use of the airwaves, this factor creates an in-built restriction on its use as in the case of any other public property. (2) The right to impart and receive information is a species of the right of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(a). A citizen has a Fundamental Right to use the best means of imparting and receiving information and as such to have an access to telecasting for the purpose. However, this right to have an access to telecasting has limitations on account of the use of the public property, viz., the airwaves, involved in the exercise of the right and can be controlled and regulated by the public authority. This limitation imposed by the nature of the public property involved in the use of the electronic media is in addition to the restrictions imposed on the right to freedom of speech and expression under Art.",

    "content": "this right to have an access to telecasting has limitations on account of the use of the public property, viz., the airwaves, involved in the exercise of the right and can be controlled and regulated by the public authority. This limitation imposed by the nature of the public property involved in the use of the electronic media is in addition to the restrictions imposed on the right to freedom of speech and expression under Art. 19(2) of the Constitution.91 (3) The broadcasting media should be under the control of the public as distinct from the Government. The Central Government shall, therefore, take immediate steps to establish an independent autonomous public authority representative of all sections and interests in the society to control and regulate the use of the airwaves. The Supreme Court has also emphasized in the instant case that freedom of speech and expression involves not merely freedom to communicate information and ideas without interference but also the freedom to receive the same. The right to freedom of speech and expression includes the right to educate, to inform and to entertain and also the right to be educated, informed and entertained. The right to telecast a sporting event therefore includes the right to educate and inform the present and the prospective sportsmen interested in the particular game and also to inform and entertain the lovers of the game. The right to information and right to acquire knowledge about the game of cricket through electronic media is a right guaranteed under Art. 19(1)(a). The Board of Cricket Control or the Cricket Association function on the basis of \"no profit no loss\". Their main aim is to promote the game of cricket. Therefore, telecast by such a body of a cricket match can hardly be regarded as a commercial activity. Because of its educational and entertainment values, this activity falls more appropriately under Art. 19(1)(a). It can thus be seen that the Supreme Court has interpreted Art. 19(1)(a) broadly so as to bring broadcasting and telecasting within its coverage. Also, the Court has taken a very significant step by way of freeing these activities from governmental monopolistic control. Also, the function of regulating airwaves will henceforth be performed by an autonomous body rather than the Government itself. Page 1152 (u) VOTING Voting at an election is a form of expression.92 A citizen as a voter is the master of his vote. He must have necessary information so that he can intelligently decide in favour of a candidate who satisfies his criterion of being elected as an MP or MLA. D. RESTRICTIONS UNDER ART. 19(2) (a) GROUNDS OF RESTRICTIONS While it is necessary to maintain and preserve freedom of speech and expression in a democracy, so also it is necessary to place some curbs on this freedom for the maintenance of social order. No freedom can be absolute or completely unrestricted. Accordingly, under Art. 19(2), the state may make a law imposing 'reasonable restrictions' on the exercise of the right to freedom of speech and expression 'in the interests of' the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency, morality, sovereignty and integrity of India, or 'in relation to contempt of Court, defamation or incitement to an offence'. The expression used in Art. 19(2) \"in the interests of\" give a wide amplitude to the permissible law which can be enacted to impose reasonable restrictions on the right guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(a) under one of the heads mentioned in Art. 19(2). No restriction can be placed on the right to freedom of speech and expression on any ground other than those specified in Art. 19(2). The burden is on the authority to justify the restrictions imposed. A look at the grounds contained in Art. 19(2) goes to show that they are all conceived in the national interest or in the interest of the society. The first set of grounds, viz., the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States and public order--are all grounds referable to national interest; whereas, the second set of grounds, viz., decency, morality, contempt of Court, defamation and incitement to offence are all conceived in the interest of the society. Some of the grounds for which restrictions can be imposed are explained below. (b) SECURITY OF STATE AND PUBLIC ORDER Article 19(2) uses two concepts: 'public order' and 'security of state'. The concept of 'public order' is wider than 'security of state'.93 As the Supreme Court points out, in Art. 19(2), there exist two expressions 'public order' and 'security of state'. Thus, 'security of state' having been specifically and expressly provided for, \"public order cannot include the security of state, though in its widest sense it may be capable of including the said concept. Therefore, in cl. (2), public order is virtually synonymous with public peace, safety and tranquillity.\"94 The term 'public order' covers a small riot, an affray, breaches of peace, or acts disturbing public tranquillity. But 'public order' and 'public tranquillity' may not always be synonymous. For example, a man playing loud music in his home at night may disturb public tranquillity, but not public order. Therefore, such acts as disturb only the serenity of others may not fall within the term 'public order'.95 In a foreign case, the Privy Council justified restrictions on the use of loudspeakers at public meetings under 'public order' giving the phrase a meaning wide enough to cover action taken for the avoidance of excessive noise seriously interfering with the comfort or convenience of the people.96 It will be difficult to give such an extended meaning to 'public order' in India. There should be some element of disturbance of peace to bring a matter under 'public order'.1 But the Indian Courts have been able to place some curb on noise pollution.2 All grounds on which action can be taken under S. 144,Cr.",

    "content": "should be some element of disturbance of peace to bring a matter under 'public order'.1 But the Indian Courts have been able to place some curb on noise pollution.2 All grounds on which action can be taken under S. 144,Cr. P.C., fall within the term 'public order' with this rider that 'annoyance' should be of grave proportions.3 An aggravated form of disturbance of peace which threatens the foundations of, or threatens to overthrow, the state will fall within the scope of the phrase 'security of state'. The expression 'overthrowing the state' is Page 1153 covered by the term 'security of state'. Therefore, making a speech tending to overthrow the state can be made punishable.4 Under Art. 19(2), a restriction can be imposed 'in the interests of' public order, etc. The expression 'in the interests of' gives a greater leeway to the legislature to curtail freedom of speech and expression, for a law penalising activities having a tendency to cause, and not actually causing public disorder, may be valid as being 'in the interests of' public order. However, the restriction imposed must have a reasonable and rational relation with the public order, security of state, etc. If the nexus between the restriction and public order, etc., is farfetched, then the restriction cannot be sustained as being in the 'interests' of public order, etc.5 As has been stated earlier, this introduces the concept of proportionality in the area of Fundamental Rights.6 The Supreme Court has lucidly explained the effect of the clause \"in the interests of\" in O.K. Ghosh v. E.X. Joseph as follows:7 \"This clause again cannot be interpreted to mean that even if the connection between the restriction and the public order is remote and indirect, the restriction can be said to be in the interests of public order. A restriction can be said to be in the interests of public order only if the connection between the restriction and the public order is proximate and direct. Indirect or far-fetched or unreal connection between the restriction and public order would not fall within the purview of the expression 'in the interests of public order.' \" In Ram Manohar Lohia,8 Subba Rao, J., speaking for the Court, pointed out that the expression \"in the interests of public order\" though wider than the phrase \"for the maintenance of public order\" still could not mean that the existence of any remote or fanciful connection between the impugned act and public order would be sufficient to sustain the validity of the law. The connection between the act prohibited or penalised and public order should be intimate. In other words, there should be a reasonable and rational relation between it and the object sought to be achieved, viz., public order. The nexus should thus be proximate--not far-fetched, problematical or too remote in the chain of its relation with public order. A legal provision making penal speeches or expressions on the part of an individual 'which incite or encourage the commission of violent crimes such as murder' would be valid as these speeches or expressions cannot but undermine the security of the State.9Sec. 295A, I.P.C., penalizes a person who 'with deliberate and malicious intention', by words either spoken or written, or by visible representations, insults or attempts to insult the religious beliefs of any class. The constitutional validity of the provision was challenged on the ground that the section was wide enough to cover even trifling forms of religious insults which may not involve any question of public order. It was thus argued that S. 295A , IPC, be declared void. But the Supreme Court did not do so. The Court ruled that S. 295A makes criminal only graver types of conduct involving insults to religion or religious beliefs. The provision penalizes not every act of, or attempt to, insult the religious beliefs of a class of citizens, but only those aggravated forms of insult to religion which are perpetrated with the deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of a class of citizens. The calculated tendency of such an aggravated form of insult is clearly to disrupt public order and hence the provision is valid.10 A provision made penal any instigation not to pay any exaction to government. The Supreme Court ruled that the prohibition imposed was too wide, as it \"takes in the innocent and the guilty persons, bona fide and mala fide advice, individuals and class, abstention from payment and deferment of payment, express or implied instigation, indirect or direct instigation... In short, no person, whether legal adviser or a friend or a well-wisher of a person instigated can escape the tentacles of this section, though in fact the rent due has been collected through coercive process or otherwise\". The section was declared invalid as there was no proximate or even foreseeable connection between such instigation and public order. The Court emphasised that the Fundamental Rights could not be controlled on \"hypothetical and imaginary considerations\". The Court rejected the argument that any instigation to break the law would in itself be a disturbance of the public order with the remark that \"if this argument without obvious limitation be accepted, it would destroy the right to freedom of speech which is the very foundation of democratic way of life\".11 Page 1154 Section 124A,I.P.C., punishes any person who by words, spoken or written, attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites disaffection towards the government established by law. In the pre-Independence era, this section had been interpreted very broadly, and exciting or attempting to incite bad feelings towards the government was held punishable whether or not it resulted in public disorder.12 Obviously, the section in such a broad form could not be sustained under Art. 19(2). In Kedar Nath v. State of Bihar, 13 the Supreme Court upheld S. 124A by interpreting it restrictively--as rendering penal only such activities as would be intended, or have a tendency, to create disorder.",

    "content": "In Kedar Nath v. State of Bihar, 13 the Supreme Court upheld S. 124A by interpreting it restrictively--as rendering penal only such activities as would be intended, or have a tendency, to create disorder. In Kedar Nath, the Court took the position that when a provision of law is capable of two interpretations, one of which makes it constitutional and the other unconstitutional, the interpretation which makes it constitutional should be preferred. Accordingly, the Court ruled that a mere criticism of government action, however strongly worded, would be consistent with the Fundamental Right of freedom of speech and expression. Only the words having the pernicious tendency, or intended to create disturbance of law and order would be penal in the interests of public order. The gist of the offence, the Supreme Court said, \"is incitement to disorder or tendency or likelihood of public disorder or the reasonable apprehension thereof.\" For determination of criminality, the Court in each case has to determine whether the words in question have \"the pernicious tendency\" and the uttered has the \"intention of creating public disorder or disturbance of law and order.\" Then only the penal law would take note of the utterance.14 On the other hand, considering the constitutional validity of S. 3 of the Pepsu Police (Incitement to Disaffection) Act, the Court has ruled that attempting to cause disaffection amongst the members of a police force towards government established by law, or inducing any member of a police force to commit a breach of discipline may be made penal. Any breach of discipline by members of police force must reasonably be reflected in a threat to public order, for an indisciplined police force could hardly serve as an instrument for maintenance of public order.15 The Court observed: \"Any breach in the discipline by its members must necessarily be reflected in a threat to public order and tranquillity. If the police force itself were indisciplined they could hardly serve as instruments for the maintenance of public order or function properly as the machinery through which order could be maintained among the general public.\" Public order is not the same thing as public safety. Hence no restrictions can be imposed on the right to freedom of speech and expression on the ground that public safety is endangered. (c) SOVEREIGNTY AND INTEGRITY OF INDIA Section Sections 2 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1961, makes penal the questioning of the \"territorial integrity or frontiers of India\" in a manner which is, or is likely to be, prejudicial to the interests of the safety or security of India. (d) FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN STATES The idea behind imposing restrictions on the freedom of speech in the interests of friendly relations with a foreign country is that persistent and malicious propaganda against a foreign power having friendly relations with India may cause considerable embarrassment to India, and, accordingly, indulging in such a propaganda may be prohibited. The ground, however, is of broad import and is susceptible of supporting legislation which may even restrict legitimate criticism of the foreign policy of the Government of India. Under Art. 367(3), a foreign State means any State other than India. The President, however, may, subject to any law made by Parliament, by order declare any State not to be a foreign State for such purposes as may be specified in the order. The Constitution (Declaration as to Foreign State) Order, 1950, directs that a Commonwealth country is not to be a foreign State for the purposes of the Constitution. The question, therefore, arises whether a restriction can be imposed on the freedom of speech on the ground of its being prejudicial to a Commonwealth country. The Supreme Court has stated in Jagan Nath v. Union of India16 that a country may not be regarded as a foreign State for the purposes of the Constitution, but may be regarded as a foreign power for other purposes. The affairs amongst the Commonwealth countries are foreign affairs and they are foreign powers in relation to each other. Therefore, a Page 1155 Commonwealth country is a foreign country for purposes of Art. 19(2). (e) INCITEMENT TO AN OFFENCE According to the general theories of criminal law, incitement and abutment of a crime is punishable. Incitement to serious and aggravated offences, like murder, may be punished as involving the security of the State.17 Incitement to many other offences may be made punishable as affecting the public order. But there may still be some offences like bribery, forgery, cheating, etc., having no public order aspect, and incitement to which could not be made punishable as an aspect of public order. So. Art. 19(2) has the words 'incitement to an offence'. The word 'offence' has not been defined in the Constitution but according to the General Clauses Act it means any act or omission made punishable by law. This is a broad concept and so it is possible for the Legislature to create an offence and make incitement thereto punishable. In this way, the freedom of speech can be effectively circumscribed as any subject can be precluded from public discussion by making it an offence. (f) CONTEMPT OF COURT In a democratic society, freedom of speech and expression is a prized privilege and a salutary right of the people. But, at the same time, no less important is the maintenance of independence and integrity of the judiciary and public confidence in the administration of justice. It thus becomes necessary to draw a balance between the two values. Power has been specifically conferred on the Supreme Court [ Art. 129] as well as each High Court [ Art. 215] to punish its contempt. The freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(a) is thus subject to Arts. 19(2), 129 and 215. The question of contempt of the Supreme Court and of the High Courts has already been discussed earlier.18Contempt of other Courts can be punished by the High Courts under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1952.",

    "content": "has been specifically conferred on the Supreme Court [ Art. 129] as well as each High Court [ Art. 215] to punish its contempt. The freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(a) is thus subject to Arts. 19(2), 129 and 215. The question of contempt of the Supreme Court and of the High Courts has already been discussed earlier.18Contempt of other Courts can be punished by the High Courts under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1952. A challenge to the Act as imposing an unreasonable restriction on the right under Art. 19(1)(a), because it provides no definition of the expression 'contempt of Court', has been rejected on the ground that the expression has a well-recognised judicial interpretation.19 The law of contempt of Court as administered by the Supreme Court under Art. 129 has been held to be reasonable under Art. 19(2).20S. 228,I.P.C., also makes some cases of contempt of Court punishable. While the Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and expression, it also lays down that in exercising that right, contempt of Court may not be committed. The underlying idea is that authority of Courts be preserved and obstructions to the due administration of justice removed. Charging the judiciary as \"an instrument of oppression\", and the judges as \"guided and dominated by class hatred\" \"instinctively favouring the rich against the poor\" has been held to constitute contempt of Court as these words weaken the authority of law and law Courts, and have the effect of lowering the prestige of judges and Courts in the eyes of the people.21 The Supreme Court has observed recently on the question of contempt of Court: \"We wish to emphasize that under the cover of freedom of speech and expression no party can be given a licence to misrepresent the proceedings and orders of the Court and deliberately paint an absolutely wrong and incomplete picture which has the tendency to scandalise the Court and bring it into dispute or ridicule.... Indeed, freedom of speech and expression is \"life blood of democracy\" but this freedom is subject to certain qualifications. An offence of scandalising the Court per se is one such qualification.\"22 (g) TRIAL BY MEDIA Interference with administration of justice is not a permissible freedom nor an unreasonable restriction. In a case relating to suicide by wife due to her harassment for dowry, an application for grant of anticipatory bail Page 1156 was rejected by Courts below. When special leave petition from such rejection was pending before Supreme Court, an article appeared in a magazine based on an interview of the family of the deceased, giving their version of the tragedy and extensively quoting the father of the deceased as to his version of the case which could all be materials that may be used in the forthcoming trial. The Supreme Court took the view that such articles appearing in the media would certainly interfere with the administration of justice and deprecated such practice and cautioned the publisher, editor and the journalist who were responsible for the said article against indulging in such trial by media when the issue was sub judice.23 Again the Supreme Courthas said that before placing criticism of a judgment in public, all concerned in its publication have to see whether any such criticism has crossed limits of fair criticism. Right to freedom of media has to be exercised responsibly and internal mechanism should be devised to prevent publications that would bring judiciary into disrepute and interfere with administration of justice, especially since judiciary has no way of replying thereto by the very nature of its office. Proclivity to sensationalism is to be curbed in every case and it would be no answer to plead that publisher, editor or others concerned did not know of the contemptuous nature of publication or that it was done in haste. For rule of law and orderly society, a free responsible press and independent judiciary are both indispensable. Both have to be, therefore, protected. While the media can, in the public interest, resort to reasonable criticism of a judicial act or the judgment of a Court for public good or report any such statements, it should refrain from casting scurrilous aspersions on, or impute improper motives or personal bias to the judge. Nor should they scandalize the Court or the judiciary as a whole, or make personal allegations of lack of ability or integrity against a judge. The judgments of Courts are public documents and can be commented upon, analysed and criticized, but it has to be in a dignified manner without attributing motives.24 (h) DEFAMATION Defamation is both a crime as well as a tort. According to Winfield: \"Defamation is the publication of a statement which reflects on a person's reputation and tends to lower him in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally or tends to make them shun or avoid him.\"25 As a crime, Defamation is defined in S. 49,I.P.C. The law seeks to protect a person in his reputation as in his person or property. (i) DECENCY OR MORALITY These are terms of variable content having no fixed meaning for ideas about decency or morality vary from society to society and time to time depending on the standards of morals prevailing in the contemporary society.

    "content": "to 294 lists some of the offences like selling obscene books, selling obscene things to young persons, committing an obscene act, or singing an obscene song in a public place.S. 292,I.P.C., has been held valid because the law against obscenity seeks no more than to promote public decency and morality.26 The test of obscenity is whether the tendency of the matter charged as obscene is to deprive and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences, and into whose hands a publication of this sort is likely to fall.27 Again, the Court has observed in Chandrakant:28 \"What we have to see is that whether a class, not an isolated case, into whose hands the book, article, or story falls suffer in their moral outlook or become depraved by reading it or might have impure and lecherous thoughts aroused in their minds. The charge of obscenity must, therefore, be judged from this aspect\". On the question of obscenity, the Court has laid emphasis on \"the importance of art to a value judgment\" by the censors. Art should be preserved and promoted in any scheme of censorship for, as the Court observed, \"The artistic appeal or presentation of an episode robs it of its vulgarity and harm...\" In short what the Court means is that there is a distinction between artistry and pornography. In Ramesh Prabhoo,29 the Supreme Court has given somewhat wider meaning to the term 'decency' and 'morality'. The Court has maintained that 'decency' or 'morality' is not confined to sexual morality alone. The Page 1157 ordinary dictionary meaning of 'decency' indicates that the action must be in conformity with the current standards of behaviour or propriety. The Court has cited with approval the following observation from an English case:30 \"...... Indecency is not confined to sexual indecency; indeed it is difficult to find any limit short of saying that it includes anything which an ordinary decent man or woman would find to be shocking, disgusting and revolting....\" Accordingly, the Court has ruled that in a secular society, the requirement of correct behaviour or propriety is that a candidate at an election should not make an appeal for votes in the name of his religion. Seeking of votes at an election on the ground of the candidate's religion in a secular state is against the norms of decency and propriety of the society and a statutory provision declaring this as a corrupt practice is constitutionally valid. (j) FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND DISCIPLINE IN CIVIL SERVICE The Supreme Court has ruled in Devendrappa that reasonable restrictions may have to be imposed on the freedom of speech and expression in the interest of maintaining discipline in public services, even though it may not have been mentioned as a ground in Art. 19(2).31 The appellant, in the instant case, was the general manager of the Karnataka Small Industries Development Corporation. In a statement made to the press he made a direct attack on the head of his organisation. In a letter to the Governor, he made attacks on several officials of the corporation. He was dismissed from service on the ground that his conduct was clearly detrimental to the proper functioning of the organization, or its internal discipline. He challenged the service rules as well as his dismissal, but the Supreme Court upheld both. He challenged his dismissal on the ground of breach of his freedom of speech and expression, but the Court rejected his plea. The Court expressed the view that a service rule is made to maintain discipline within the service and not to curtail the freedom of speech. Rules of government service designed for proper discharge of duties and obligations by government servants are not invalidated under Art. 19(1)(a) although such rules may, to some extent, curtail or impose limitations on the Fundamental Rights of these persons. Although freedom under Art. 19(1)(a) applies to government servants, it does not mean that the responsibility arising from official position of government servants could not impose some limitations on the exercise of their rights as citizens. The Court justified the service rules under Art. 19(2). These rules cannot be invalidated even if not justified under Art. 19(2). On the question of interrelation of several freedoms guaranteed by Art. 19, the Court has observed that they \"are not necessarily and in all circumstances mutually supportive, although taken together they weave a fabric of a free and equal democratic society\". Proper exercise of rights may have, implicit in them, certain restrictions. The rights must be harmoniously construed so that they are properly promoted with the minimum of such implied and necessary restrictions. Joining government service has, implicit in it, if not explicitly so laid down, the observance of a certain code of conduct necessary for the proper discharge of functions as a government servant. This code cannot be flouted in the name of other freedoms. Of course, the Courts have to be vigilant to ensure that the code is not so widely framed as to unreasonably restrict fundamental freedoms. \"But a reasonable code designed to promote discipline and efficiency can be enforced by the Government organisation in the sense that those who flout it can be subjected to disciplinary action\".32 In the instant case, the conduct of the petitioner was clearly detrimental to the proper functioning of the organisation, or its internal discipline. \"On a proper balancing, therefore, of individual freedom of the appellant and the proper functioning of the government organisation which had employed him, this was a fit case where the employer was entitled to take disciplinary action against him under the service Rules.\" But the Supreme Court has refused to apply the Devendrappa ruling to an elected member of the corporation who criticised the house tax assessment by the council and asked the tax payers to approach him for sorting out their grievances.",

    "content": "was exercising his democratic right of fair criticism, and it could not be regarded as misconduct on his part, and he could not be removed from the municipal council on that ground.33 He was Page 1158 an elected member of the municipal council and not its employee. As a representative of the people he owed a duty not merely to the municipal council, but also to the public in his constituency. He held the office in trust for them. As an elected representative of the people, he was expected to safeguard their interest. As such, he would enjoy freedom of speech under Art. 19(1)(a), which includes fair criticism of the law or any executive action. The Supreme Court has observed in this connection:34 \"Freedom of speech and expression is guaranteed in our democratic republic both in legislature as well as in local bodies and, therefore, a legislator or a municipal councillor legitimately can express his views in regard to what he thinks to be in public interest. A legitimate exercise of right of speech and expression including a fair criticism is not to be throttled.\" (k) NOISE POLLUTION Lately the Courts have been very conscious of the fact of environmental pollution in India. Accordingly, the Courts have started playing an activist role in the matter of protecting environment. For this purpose, the Courts have invoked Art. 21 and in a number of cases thereunder, the Courts have tackled a number of problems relating to pollution.35 The Courts have also interpreted Art. 19 so as to ensure that anti-environmental activities are not protected thereby. On perusal of the relevant case-law, one may conclude that the Courts have refused to protect polluting activities under Art. 19. On the other hand, it seems that the various clauses in Art. 19 have been so interpreted as to exclude such activities from their protection. Coming to Art. 19(1)(a), the emerging judicial view is that the freedom of speech can be exercised by a person subject to keeping the level of noise pollution within bearable limits. Although noise pollution has not been mentioned in Art. 19(2) as a ground for which reasonable restrictions can be imposed on the freedom of speech, the Courts have implied this limitation from Art. 19(1)(a) itself. The Courts have argued that freedom of speech includes the freedom to remain silent. The Courts have raised the question: can a person exercise his right under Art. 19(1)(a) so as to interfere with the freedom of others? To put it differently, can a citizen say that notwithstanding that he is causing public nuisance and interfering with the right of others, he would be entitled to enjoy his freedom under Art. 19(1)(a) in any way he likes, or absolutely without any restriction? The Courts have answered this question as follows: when a person enjoys his right under Art. 19(1)(a), he must do so causing very minimum inconvenience to others. A person cannot claim his freedom of speech so as to interfere with the human rights and Fundamental Rights of others.36 The question of noise pollution has arisen in connection with the use of loud speakers. Loud speakers amplify sound manifold and thus create noise pollution. The question has arisen: how far can the use of loud speakers be regulated under Art. 19(1)(a)? In the U.S.A., an uncontrolled discretion vested in the Chief of Police to permit or not to permit the use of loudspeakers at public meetings has been held to be bad for \"loudspeakers are today indispensable instruments of effective public speech\".37 To begin with, the Courts in India also took the same position. It was ruled that the right to use loudspeakers can be regarded as a Fundamental Right in itself being a part of the right of the freedom of speech and expression and, so, a blanket ban on the use of loudspeakers cannot be imposed. A person has a right to propagate, communicate and circulate his views through all means of communication and through all forms of media for reaching a wider audience. Reasonable restriction can, however, be imposed on this right under Art. 19(2). An uncontrolled discretion cannot be given to executive officers to control the use of loudspeakers, etc. The discretion will have to be controlled as exercisable only when there is an apprehension of a breach of peace. A condition that at a public meeting, loudspeakers should not be used at any time infringes Art. 19(1)(a).38 For example, in an early case, Indulal v. State of Gujarat, 39 the Gujarat High Court held that freedom of Page 1159 speech includes freedom to circulate one's views in any manner. The Court drew support for this view from the Privy Council's decision in Francis v. Chief of Police.40 On the other hand, lately the Courts have started adopting a different stance. For example, in K. Venu v. Director General of Police, 41 a single Judge of the Kerala High Court expressed the view that he was not inclined to hold that the right to use loudspeakers was a Fundamental Right in itself on the ground that sound pollution was an accepted danger and indiscriminate use of loudspeakers could not be permitted. In a given situation, it was for the authority concerned to satisfy itself whether a loudspeaker could be used or not. In P.A. Jacob v. Supdt. of Police, Kottayam, 42 the Kerala High Court has taken noise pollution into account saying, \"exposure to high noise is a known risk\". The Court has observed: \"If an absolute right is conceded in this behalf, it will be an unlimited charter for aural aggression.\" \"However wide a right is, it cannot be as wide as to destroy similar or other rights in others\". And, further the High Court has said: \"The right to speech implies the right to silence. It implies freedom, not to listen, and not to be forced to listen\".",

    "content": "further the High Court has said: \"The right to speech implies the right to silence. It implies freedom, not to listen, and not to be forced to listen\". But the Court has maintained that even though use of loudspeakers does not constitute a Fundamental Right, denial of the use of loudspeakers could validly take place only within the confines of the relevant law. In the instant case, denial of permission by the police authorities was held to be wrongful and arbitrary and for no reason. The Calcutta High Court has imposed restrictions on the use of loudspeakers at the time of azan on the ground of noise pollution. The Court has stated that excessive noise certainly causes pollution in society. In India, there is no effective law made to control the noise creator. But, under Art. 19(1)(a), read with Art. 21, the citizens have a right of a decent environment and have a right to live peacefully, right to sleep at night and a right to leisure which are all necessary ingredients of the right to life guaranteed under Art. 21.43 In another case,44 the Calcutta High Court has stated that unfortunately, in India, no restriction has been placed on the user of microphones or loudspeakers. Therefore, it is the duty of the Court to show judicial creativity in the matter. The Court has stated, \"....where a law of the past does not fit in the present context, the Court should evolve a new law...\"45 The Court has emphasized that the citizens are entitled to live in society peacefully, free from mechanical and artificial sounds which create a tremendous health hazards and adverse effect on the citizen. Citizens have a right to live in a society which is free from pollution. If the legislature fails to make an appropriate law for the purpose of controlling noise pollution, the Courts have to fill the gap. In the words of the Court:46 \"If a citizen has a right it is also equally a duty on the part of this Court to see that such rights are preserved and not allowed to be destroyed. Legislature may not rise to the occasion but that does not mean that Court will keep its hand folded in the absence of any legislative mandate. The Courts are the custodian of the rights of the citizens and if the Court is of the view that citizens rights guaranteed under the Constitution of India are violated, the Court is not powerless to end the wrong.\" The question of controlling noise pollution has also become embroiled with the question of religious freedom guaranteed by Arts. 25 and 26.47 Can a church claim the freedom to relay prayers on the loud speakers causing noise pollution and nuisance to the residents?. The Supreme Court has ruled in Church of God v. K.K.R.M.C.Welfare Ass.48that the question of religious freedom does not arise as no religion requires that prayers be performed through voice amplifiers. The Court directed that the guidelines framed by the Government under the relevant rules framed under the Environment Protection Act, 1986, must be followed by the concerned authorities.49 (l) ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRETION The general principle is that it is unreasonable to leave absolute and arbitrary discretion to an administrative officer to regulate the freedom of speech and expression. The discretion to be valid must be exercisable for purposes specified in Art. 19(2), and subject to legislative policy and procedural safeguards. This judicial Page 1160 approach is illustrated by the following cases. A provision authorising the district magistrate to prohibit dramatic performances of a scandalous or defamatory nature, corrupting persons or arousing or likely to excite feelings of disaffection to the government has been held to be unconstitutional for it makes a district magistrate the final authority to determine the question whether or not a particular play is offensive under the Act. Further, the district magistrate is not obligated to give reasons for his decision and there is no high authority (judicial or otherwise) to review his decision.50 A significant judicial pronouncement in the area is Virendra v. State of Punjab .51 Sec. 2 of a Punjab Act empowered the State Government to prohibit the printing of any matter relating to a particular subject for a maximum period of two months in any issue of a newspaper if the government was satisfied that such action was necessary to prevent any activity prejudicial to the maintenance of communal harmony likely to affect public order. The aggrieved party could make a representation to the government against the order, which, after consideration of the same, could modify, confirm or rescind the order. Sec. 3 authorised the State Government to prohibit the bringing into Punjab of any newspaper if it was satisfied that such action was necessary to prevent any activity prejudicial to the maintenance of communal harmony affecting public order. These provisions were challenged on the ground of giving arbitrary and uncontrolled discretion to the government to curtail freedom of speech 'on its subjective satisfaction'. The Supreme Courtpointed out that there existed in Punjab serious tension amongst the various communities and in such a situation, conferment of wide powers to be exercised in the subjective satisfaction of the government could not be regarded as an unreasonable restriction. The State Government being in possession of all material facts, was the best authority to take anticipatory action for prevention of threatened breach of peace. Therefore, determination of the time when, and the extent to which, restriction should be imposed on the Press must of necessity be left to the judgment and discretion of the government. To make the exercise of those powers justiciable would defeat the very purpose of the Act. Further, the Court held that a law conferring discretion on the executive could not be invalid if it laid down the policy so that discretion was exercised to effectuate the policy. The law in question satisfied this test for it laid down the purposes for which the power could be exercised. Further, in S.",

    "content": "the Court held that a law conferring discretion on the executive could not be invalid if it laid down the policy so that discretion was exercised to effectuate the policy. The law in question satisfied this test for it laid down the purposes for which the power could be exercised. Further, in S. 2, there were two safeguards subject to which the government was to exercise its power, viz., an order could remain in force only for two months, and the aggrieved person could make a representation to the government against the order, and so S. 2, as a whole, was valid. S. 3 was held invalid for it neither laid down any time-limit for the operation of the order, nor did it provide for any representation to the government against the order.52 Under S. 144 , Cr.P.C., where in the opinion of a district magistrate there is sufficient ground for proceeding under this section and immediate prevention or speedy remedy is desirable, he may, by a written order stating the material facts of the case, direct any person to abstain from a certain act if the district magistrate considers that such direction is likely to prevent danger to human life, health or safety, or a disturbance of the public tranquillity, or a riot, or an affray. The magistrate could, either on his own motion or on the application of any aggrieved person, rescind or alter any order made by him. When an aggrieved person applies, the magistrate is to give him an opportunity of showing cause against the order. If the application is rejected, the magistrate will record his reasons in writing for doing so. No order underS. 144 is to remain in force for longer than two months, but the State Government could direct otherwise in cases of danger to human life, health or safety, or a likelihood of a riot or an affray. The provision was challenged on the ground that it confers too wide powers on the district magistrate to put restrictions on the freedom of speech and assembly. Rejecting the argument, the Supreme Court has ruled in Babulal Parate,53that S. 144 is intended to be availed of for preventing disorders, obstructions and annoyances. The magistrate has to act judicially; restraints permissible under S. 144 are of a temporary nature and can only be imposed in an emergency. An opportunity is to be given to the aggrieved person to show cause against the order and the magistrate has to record reasons if he rejects the application of the aggrieved person. The duty to maintain law and order rests on the district magistrate and, therefore, there is nothing unreasonable in making him the initial judge of the emergency.53 Page 1161 But that part of the section [ S. 144(6)] which authorises the State Government to extend the life of the order beyond two months has been found to be invalid in Misra,54 because no safeguards were provided in that case. The government exercises its powers in an executive manner; an order passed by it need not be of a temporary duration, and the aggrieved party has been given no opportunity to make representation against government's order. Under S. 99 -A, Cr.P.C., 1898 [presentlyS. 95,Cr.P.C., 1974) the State Government may, by notification in the Gazette stating the grounds of its opinion, forfeit any book, newspaper or any document containing seditious matter, etc. InHarnam Das v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 55 the Court quashed the notification forfeiting certain books because the Government failed to state the grounds for forming its opinion. The ambit of government's power is too large and uncontrolled. A notable example of administrative regulation of freedom of speech and expression is to be found in the system of film censorship. In K.A. Abbas v. Union of India, 56 the Supreme Court has upheld censorship of films under 19(1)(a) on the ground that films have to be treated separately from other forms of art and expression because a motion picture is able to stir up emotions more deeply than any other product of art. Films can therefore be censored on the grounds mentioned in Art. 19(2). There exists the Board of Film Censors for the purpose.57 Prior to the Abbas case, the final appellate powers from the decision of the film censors lay in the Central Government. This was challenged on the ground of its inconsistency with Art. 19(1)(a). The Central Government agreed to change this and vest the appellate powers in an independent tribunal. The Court expressed satisfaction that the Central Government would cease to perform curial functions through one of its Secretaries in the sensitive field of freedom of speech and expression. \"Experts sitting as a Tribunal and deciding matters quasi-judicially inspire more confidence than a Secretary...\" The Government also agreed to prescribe reasonable time-limits for the decision of the authorities censoring the film.58 A tribunal has now been established to replace the Central Government as the appellate tribunal from the decision of the Board of Film Censors. But a provision was put in the Cinematography Act through which the Central Government could review the decision of the Appellate Tribunal. The Supreme Court held this provision to be unconstitutional being \"a travesty of the Rule of law which is one of the basic structure of the Constitution.\" The Court disliked the idea of the executive sitting in appeal over the decision of a quasi-judicial body. The Court insisted that the executive must obey judicial orders rather than vice versa. The government claimed that the power was necessary because on certain occasions there was public resentment to a film, and this created law and order problem even though the film had been cleared by the Board or the Tribunal.",

In Ushodaya Publications (P) Ltd. v. State of Andhra Pradesh, 60 the Andhra Pradesh High Court said that the newspapers had no right to demand advertisements from the government. On the other hand, the government did have a right to choose the newspapers in which it would advertise. While the government could give its advertisements to such papers as it pleased, it could not discriminate between one newspaper and another.61 Government's discretion to grant largess must be structured by rational, relevant and non-discriminatory standards or norms.62 The government must not use its power to give advertisements to muzzle the press which criticises its policies and actions. The Court held conditions (i), (ii), (iv), (vi) and (viii) valid but not conditions (iii), (v) and (vii) as it was very difficult to decide the matters mentioned therein.63 Page 1162 A notice served on the Indian Express for cancellation of the lease and demolition of its building was quashed by the Supreme Court in Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India .64 The company publishing the paper took on perpetual lease a piece of land from the Central Government for construction of its building. On the allegation that the building did not conform with the sanctioned plan, a notice to cancel the lease and for re-entry and demolition of the building was served on the company. The company challenged the same as being violative of the freedom of the press. The allegation was that the Indian Express was a trenchant critic of the Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and as a vindictive measure the notice in question had been given to it. It was also stated that whatever the deviations, they had all been sanctioned by the concerned Central Minister. The Supreme Court quashed the notice holding it to be mala fide. The Court came to the conclusion that the notice of the re-entry and the threatened demolition of the Express buildings were intended and meant to silence the voice of the Indian Express. The impugned notice was held to constitute a direct and immediate threat to the freedom of the press and, thus, violative of Art. 19(1)(a) read with Art. 14. (m) PRESS COUNCIL The Press Council was first established in 1965 but was abolished in 1976 during the internal emergency declared on June 25, 1975.65The Council was re-established in 1978 by the Press Council Act, 1978. The Council is conceived as an agency of self-regulation, and the preservation of the freedom, of the press. It consists primarily of working journalists, managers and owners of newspapers. Its avowed objects are preservation of the freedom of the press and maintenance and improvement of the standards of newspapers in India. If a newspaper offends against standards of journalistic ethics or public taste, or if an editor or working journalist commits professional misconduct, the council may, after giving a hearing and recording the reasons, censure newspaper, editor or the journalist concerned.66 The jurisdiction of the council to protect the freedom of the press is every broad. The council can take note of violation of the right to liberty of the press from any agency--be that the State, State functionary, public authority, companies, individual or any person, real or fictional.67 E. FREEDOM TO ASSEMBLE: ARTS. 19(1)(b) AND 19(3) ARTICLE 19(1)(B) Article 19(1)(b) guarantees to the citizens of India the right to assemble peaceably and without arms. Under Art. 19(3), however, the state can make any law imposing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of this right in the interests of public order, and sovereignty and integrity of India. To some extent, there is common ground between Arts. 19(1)(a) and 19(1)(b). For example, demonstrations, processions and meetings considered under Art. 19(1)(a) also fall under Art. 19(1)(b) for a demonstration also amounts to an assembly and, therefore, the same principles apply under both Articles.68 The right to strike is not available under either of these Articles.69 Article 19(1)(b) does not confer on any one a right to hold meetings in government premises. Therefore, Railways can validly prohibit holding of meetings in their premises either within or outside office hours. The right of assembly cannot be exercised on the property of somebody. Railways are entitled to enjoy their properties in the same manner as any private individual subject to such restrictions as may be placed on them by law or usage.70 But a right to hold public meetings on government property (like a maidan) can be created by usage.71 It is not valid to confer uncontrolled discretion on administrative officers to regulate the freedom of assembly. A rule banning holding of public meetings on public streets without police permission has been held bad in Himmat Lal v. Police Commissioner .72 In India, citizens had a right to hold meetings on public streets before the Constitution, subject to the control of appropriate authority regarding the time and place of the meeting and considerations of public order. The rule in question gave no guidance as to the circumstances in which permission to hold a meeting could be refused and, therefore, gave arbitrary powers.73 Page 1163 F.

FREEDOM TO FORM ASSOCIATION :ARTS. (19)(1)(c) AND 19(4) (a) ARTICLE 19(1)(C) Article 19(1)(c) guarantees to the citizens of India the right to form associations or unions. Under Art. 19(4), reasonable restrictions in the interests of public order or morality or sovereignty and integrity of India may be imposed on this right by law. The right to form associations is the very lifeblood of democracy. Without such a right, political parties cannot be formed, and without such parties a democratic form of government, especially that of the parliamentary type, cannot be run properly. Hence the Constitution guarantees the right to form associations subject to such restrictions as can be imposed under Art. 19(4). Recognising the importance of the right of forming associations in a democratic society, the Courts have not favoured the vesting of absolute discretion in the executive to interfere with this Fundamental Right. A discretion vested in a government official to prohibit formation of an association, without proper safeguards, has been held to be unconstitutional. A law empowered the State Government to declare an association unlawful on the ground that such association constituted a danger to the public peace, or interfered with the maintenance of public order, or the administration of the law. The government notification had to specify the grounds for making the order and fix a reasonable period to make a representation against the order. The State Government was, however, authorised not to disclose any facts which it regarded as being against public interest. The government had to place the notification and the representation against it before an advisory board. If the board, after considering the material, found that there was no sufficient cause for declaring the association unlawful, the government was bound to cancel the order. In State of Madras v. V.G. Row, 74 the Supreme Court declared the provision to be unconstitutional, for the test to declare an association unlawful was 'subjective' and the factual existence of the grounds was not justiciable. The Court emphasized that curtailing the right to form associations was fraught with serious potential reactions in religious, political and economic fields. Therefore, the vesting of power in the government to impose restrictions on this right without having the grounds therefor tested in a judicial inquiry was a strong element to be taken into consideration in judging the reasonableness of the restrictions. The existence of a summary and largely one-sided review by an advisory board was no substitute for a judicial inquiry. A requirement that teachers of schools should seek the Board's permission to engage in political activities has been held to be wholesome, for a teacher has got to be under certain terms and discipline of employment and it is detrimental to his calling to get mixed up into rivalries in respect of the union, panchayat or the district board.75 At times, recognition of an association by the government may affect the right to form an association, e.g., if the government were to prohibit its servants from becoming members of an unrecognised association, then formation of an association becomes vitally linked up with government recognition, for without recognition, the right to form association becomes illusory. In such a situation, Art. 19(1)(c) would control the power of the government to recognise associations. A rule provided that a union could not represent the parties in an industrial dispute unless it had been approved by the Labour Commissioner for this purpose. The application for approval could be made only two years after its formation and the Labour Commissioner had absolute discretion to accept or reject the application. These conditions for recognition were held to contravene Art. 19(1)(c).76 Similarly, the Supreme Court invalidated a rule which provided that no government servant could join or continue to be a member of any services association which the government did not recognise or in respect of which recognition has been refused or withdrawn by it. The Court held that the rule imposed a restriction on the undoubted right of a government servant under Art. 19(1)(c). The rule in question was neither reasonable nor in the interest of \"public order\" under Art. 19(4). The restriction was such as to make the right guaranteed Page 1164 under Art. 19(1)(c) illusory since the government could refuse or withdraw recognition of an association on considerations which might not have any direct or reasonable connection with discipline or efficiency of government servants or public order.77 Does the right to form associations also involve a guarantee that an association shall have the concomitant right to achieve its objectives for which it has been formed? Can the law place some restrictions on trade unions in the way of their acting as instruments of agitating and collective bargain to improve the wages of the workmen? Can it be argued that if the concomitant right of an association to achieve its purposes is not guaranteed, then the right to form association becomes an idle right? The right to form associations or unions does not include within its ken as a Fundamental Right a right to form association or unions for achieving a particular object or running a particular institution, the same being a concomitant or concomitant to a concomitant of a Fundamental Right, but not the Fundamental Right itself. A right to form association guaranteed under Article 19(1)(c) does not imply the fulfillment of every object of an association as it would be contradictory to the scheme underlying the text and the frame of the several Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Part III and particularly by the scheme of the guarantees conferred by sub-clauses (a) to (g) of clause (1) of Article 19.78 The Supreme Court has, however, not countenanced this extended dimension sought to be given to Art. 19(1)(c). The Court has ruled that the right guaranteed by Art.",

    "content": "The Court has ruled that the right guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(c) does not carry with it a concomitant right that unions formed for protecting the interests of labour shall achieve their object such that any interference to such achievement by any law would be unconstitutional unless it could be justified under Art. 19(4) as being in the interests of public order or morality. The right under Art. 19(1)(c) extends only to the formation of an association or union and insofar as the activities of the association or union are concerned, or as regards the steps which the union might take to achieve its object, they are subject to such laws as may be framed and such laws cannot be tested under Art. 19(4). The Court has held that even a very liberal interpretation of Art. 19(1)(c) cannot mean that the trade unions have a guaranteed right to strike. The right to strike may be controlled by appropriate industrial legislation.79 The above-mentioned proposition has been reiterated by the Court in the case noted below.80 Art. 19(1)(c) does not extend to, or embrace within it, the objects or purposes or the activities of an association. In other words, Art. 19(1)(c) does not carry with it a further guarantee that the objects or purposes or activities of an association so formed shall not be interfered with by law except on grounds as mentioned in Art. 19(4). In the instant case, the State Government took over an educational institution run by a society. The Court ruled that Art. 19(1)(c) had not been violated since the institute was taken over and the rights of the society remained unimpaired and uninterfered. It may be that the Institute was the only activity of the society but the Court is concerned with the right of the society to form association. So long as there is no interference with the society, its constitution or composition, merely because of the taking over or acquisition of the Institute, which was the only property or activity of the society, the Fundamental Right of the society to form association is not infringed. The Court adopted a similar approach in Raghubar Dayal v. Union of India .81The Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952, authorises the Central Government to ban forward trading in any commodity by any one except by a recognised association. A recognised association could not amend its rules except with the previous approval of the Central Government. The government could also direct the association to make certain rules. These provisions were challenged as infringing Art. 19(1)(c) and not being germane to public order or morality were not warranted by Art. 19(4). It was argued that the freedom to form an association should also include ensuring effective functioning of an association so as to enable it to achieve its lawful objects. The argument in a nutshell was that if a law regulates the recognition of an association under certain conditions subject to which alone recognition could be accorded or continued such conditions would be invalid. Thus, the Court was called upon to consider the question whether the freedom of association implies or involves a guaranteed right of recognition. The contention in the instant case was that if the object of an association was lawful, no restriction could be placed upon it except in the interest of public order and that freedom to form an association carried with it the right to determine its internal arrangements also. The Court rejected the argument. It ruled that Parliament has power to legislate for regulation of forward trading. It is voluntary, and not compulsory, for an association to seek recognition, and, therefore, conditions Page 1165 of recognition would not affect freedom to form associations. The Supreme Court thus refused to accept the theory that Art. 19(1)(c) also confers a Fundamental Right on an association to achieve each of its objectives for which it has been formed and that a law hampering the fulfilment of any of its objects, but not falling under Art. 19(4), would be unconstitutional. The freedom to associate does not involve freedom to pursue without restriction the objects of the association.82 Thus, while the right to form association is fundamental, recognition of such an association is not a Fundamental Right and, thus, Parliament can by law regulate the working of such associations by imposing conditions and restrictions on such functions. There can be no objection to statutory interference with the composition or functioning of associations which are created, controlled and governed by statute. Legislative provisions can be validly made for eliminating qualifications for membership based on sex, religion, persuasion or mode of life. However, so long as there is no legislative intervention, it is not open to the Court or authorities purportedly acting under a statute to coin a theory that a particular approved bye-law of a registered cooperative society is not desirable and would be opposed to public policy as indicted by the Constitution. Hence a challenge to the Constitutional validity of a bye law of Zoroastrian Cooperative Society restricting its membership to Parsi community has been repelled.83 A Bombay Act provided that only a 'representative union', i.e. a union having at least 15 per cent of the total employees in an industry in a local area, could represent the entire body of workers in their relations with the employees. The Court held that the Act imposed no restriction on the right to form unions of textile workers; there was nothing to prevent other unions of other workers from forming a fresh union and enrolling a higher percentage so as to acquire the right of representation.84 In P. Balakotaiah v. Union of India, 85 certain railway employees who belonged to a Worker's Union sponsored by the Communists carried on agitation for a general strike in order to paralyse communications and movement of essential supplies. They were chargesheeted and their services were terminated. The action was taken against the employees not because they were Communists but because they were engaging themselves in subversive activities.",

    "content": "v. Union of India, 85 certain railway employees who belonged to a Worker's Union sponsored by the Communists carried on agitation for a general strike in order to paralyse communications and movement of essential supplies. They were chargesheeted and their services were terminated. The action was taken against the employees not because they were Communists but because they were engaging themselves in subversive activities. The appellants, however, submitted that their dismissal from service for being communists and trade unionists amounted in substance to a denial to them of the freedom to form association. The Supreme Court rejected the plea saying that the impugned order did not prevent them from continuing to be communists or trade unionists. Their right in that regard remained as before. The appellants, no doubt, enjoyed a Fundamental Right to form associations under Art. 19(1)(c), but they had no Fundamental Right to remain in government service, and so when their services were terminated they could not complain of violation of any Fundamental Right. In Devendrappa,86 the Supreme Court has dissented from the Balakotaiah ruling entailing freedom v. service. The Court has now said that legitimate action discreetly and properly taken by a government servant with a sense of responsibility and at the proper level to remedy any malfunction in the organisation may not be barred. A person who legitimately seeks to exercise his rights under Art. 19 cannot be told that you are free to exercise the rights, but the consequences will be so serious and so damaging, that you will not, in effect, be able to exercise your freedom. This means that the Balakotaiah approach saying that a government servant is free to exercise his freedom under Art. 19(1)(a) or (b), but at the cost of his service, clearly amounts to deprivation of freedom of speech. Therefore, what the Court has to consider is the reasonableness of service rules which curtail certain kinds of activities amongst government servants in the interests of efficiency and discipline in order that they may discharge their public duties as government servants in a proper manner without undermining the prestige or efficiency of the organisation. If the rules are directly and primarily meant for this purpose, \"they being in furtherance of Art. 19(1)(g)\",87 can be upheld although they may indirectly impinge upon some other limbs of Art. 19 qua an individual employee. Courts ensure that such impingement is minimal and rules are made in public interest and for proper discharge of public interest. \"A proper balancing of interests of an individual as a citizen and the right of the state to frame a code of conduct for its employees in the interest of proper functioning of the state, is required\". Thus, Devendrappa reduces somewhat the harshness of the Balakotaiah ruling. Balakotaiah seemed to suggest that a government servant cannot exercise any freedom under Art. 19 and he can enjoy his freedom only if he gives up government service. But Devendrappa ruling permits some space to a government servant to enjoy his freedoms subject to proper functioning of the state. A balance has to be drawn between the interests of a government servant as a citizen and the interests of the state as an employer in promoting Page 1166 the efficiency of public service. The Hindi Sahitya Sammelan is a society registered under the Societies Registration Act. Because of differences among its management, some litigation started. Parliament intervened by enacting a law creating a statutory body to take over the assets of the old society. All members of the old society were to be members of the new body with some new members added by law without the volition of the original members. TheSupreme Court declared the law bad mainly on the ground that it interfered with the composition of the society itself; it interfered with the right of association of the pre-existing members of the old society insofar as new members were added without their consent, and also enrolment of new members was not at the choice of the original members. Imposing new members on the old members against their wishes clearly interfered with their right to continue to function as members of the society which was voluntarily formed by the original founders. \"The right to form an association\" \"necessarily implies that the persons forming the association, have also the right to continue to be associated with only those whom they voluntarily admit in the association. Any law by which members are introduced in the voluntary association without any option being given to the members to keep them out, or any law which takes away the membership of those who have voluntarily joined it, will be a law violating the right to form an association.\" Even a very liberal interpretation of Article 19(1) (c) cannot lead to the conclusion that the trade unions have a guaranteed right to an effective collective bargaining or to strike, either as part of collective bargaining or otherwise. The right to strike or the right to declare a lockout may be controlled or restricted by appropriate industrial legislation.88 This means that any law compulsorily altering the composition of the association amounts to a breach of the right to form the association because it violates the composite right of forming an association and the right to continue it as the original members desired it. The right to form association is not restricted only to the initial stage of forming an association. It also protects the right to continue the association with its own composition as voluntarily agreed upon by the persons forming the association. Otherwise, the right under Art. 19(1)(c) would be meaningless because, as soon as an association is formed, a law may be passed interfering with its composition, so that the association formed may not be able to function at all. The right can be effective only if it is held to include within it the right to continue the association with its composition as voluntarily agreed upon by the persons forming the association.",

The right can be effective only if it is held to include within it the right to continue the association with its composition as voluntarily agreed upon by the persons forming the association. The law in question did not merely regulate the affairs of the society; it altered its composition. Any law altering the composition of the association compulsorily will be a breach of the right to form the association of the original members guaranteed under Art. 19(1)(c). Such a law is not protected under Art. 19(4).89 (b) THE UNLAWFUL ACTIVITIES (PREVENTION) ACT, 1967 The Act authorises the Central Government to declare by notification in official gazette an association as unlawful on certain grounds mentioned in S. 2(f) of the Act. To keep control over the government power, provision has been made for appointment of a tribunal consisting of a sitting High Court Judge. A notification declaring an association unlawful is not to be effective until it is confirmed by the tribunal. The tribunal is to decide whether or not there is sufficient cause for declaring the association as unlawful. Undoubtedly, the mechanism of a tribunal is incorporated into the law as a consequence of what the Supreme Court had stated earlier in Row.90 In the wake of demolition of the Babri Mosque at Ayodhya, the Government of India issued notifications under the Act on December 10, 1992, declaring the following bodies as unlawful for two years: Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP); Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh (RSS); Bajrang Dal; Islamik Sevak Sangh and Jamaat-e-Islami Hind. The tribunal appointed under the Act upheld the ban against the VHP, but quashed the same against RSS and Bajrang Dal. The ban against the Jammat-e-Islami was upheld by the tribunal, but, on appeal, from the tribunal decision, the Supreme Courtquashed the order on the ground that \"there was no objective determination of the factual basis for the notification to amount to adjudication by the tribunal, contemplated by the Act.91 The ban against the VHP came to an end on December 9, 1994. Again, on January 14, 1995, the Government of India declared VHP as unlawful. This ban was negatived by the tribunal. It ruled that the Page 1167 notification had been issued on \"extraneous considerations\" and so it was vitiated. The tribunal ruled that the notification had been for \"collateral purposes and not for the purpose of maintaining peace and tranquillity in society\", and that the Government had \"taken into account matters which it ought not to have taken into consideration\". (c) RIGHT NOT TO FORM ASSOCIATION A question not yet free from doubt is whether the Fundamental Right to form association also envisages the right to refuse to form an association. In Tikaramji v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 1 the Supreme Court observed that assuming that the right to form an association \"implies a right not to form an association, it does not follow that the negative right must also be regarded as a Fundamental Right\". It has been already seen that while the constitution guarantees a right to form an association or unions the association or union cannot claim as a further Fundamental Right to achieve the particular purpose for which such association has been established and that such a right even if concomitant to the Fundamental Right is not a Fundamental Right in itself unless the same is justified Article 19(4).2 A co-operative society of canegrowers was formed to supply sugarcane to the sugar mills. The membership of the co-operative was voluntary. The canegrowers were free to join or not to join the society. The members were free to resign their membership except when indebted to the society. The Court held that the society did not fall foul of Art. 19(1)(c). A High Court has held that the right to form an association necessarily implies that a person is free to refuse to be a member of an association if he so desires, and, therefore, a rule making it compulsory for every teacher to become a member of a government sponsored association at the risk of suffering disciplinary action in case a teacher absents from two consecutive meetings infringes Art. 19(1)(c).3 (d) GOVERNMENT SERVANTS The Fundamental Right guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(c) can be claimed by government servants as well. A government servant may not lose his right under Art. 19(1)(c) by joining government service. But the right guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(c) to form association does not involve a guaranteed right to recognition thereof as well. In Delhi Police Non-Gazetted Karmchari Sangh v. Union of India, 4 the Supreme Court has upheld the validity of the Police Forces (Restriction of Rights) Act, 1966, which imposes certain restrictions on the enjoyment of Fundamental Rights on members of the police force. The Act has been enacted under Art. 33 but it is also valid under Art. 19(4). A rule compelling a member of the police force to withdraw his membership of an association as soon as recognition accorded to it is withdrawn, or if, no recognition is granted to it, would be protected by Art. 33.5 It is also protected by Art. 19(4), as it is a reasonable restriction on the right guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(c) in the interest of discipline and public order. (e) MORALITY The term 'morality' in Art. 19(4) is to be given a broad connotation as meaning not merely 'sexual morality' but 'public morality' as well in the wider sense as understood by the people as a whole.6 G. FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT AND RESIDENCE: ARTS. 19(1)(d), (19)(1)(e) AND 19(5) (a) ARTICLE 19(1)(D) Article 19(1)(d) guarantees to every citizen the right to move freely throughout the territory of India. Art. 19(1)(e) guarantees to a citizen the right to reside and settle in any part of India. According to Art.",

    "content": "OF MOVEMENT AND RESIDENCE: ARTS. 19(1)(d), (19)(1)(e) AND 19(5) (a) ARTICLE 19(1)(D) Article 19(1)(d) guarantees to every citizen the right to move freely throughout the territory of India. Art. 19(1)(e) guarantees to a citizen the right to reside and settle in any part of India. According to Art. 19(5), however, the State may impose reasonable restrictions on these rights by law in the interests of general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe. Page 1168 These constitutional provisions guarantee to the Indian citizens the right to go or to reside wherever they like within the Indian territory. A citizen can move freely from one State to another, or from one place to another within a State. These rights underline the concept that India is one unit so far as the citizens are concerned. The rights of movement [ Art. 19(1)(d)] and residence [ Art. 19(1)(e)] go together in most cases for when a person is asked to quit a particular place, both these rights are simultaneously affected. Therefore, most of the cases fall both under Arts. 19(1)(d) and (e) simultaneously, and more or less the same principles are followed in the matter of restrictions on any of these two rights, and hence these are being discussed together. (b) FOREIGNERS Article 19(1)(e) applies only to the citizens and not to foreigners. Accordingly, the Fundamental Right of a foreigner is confined to Art. 21 guaranteeing his life and liberty.7 He cannot claim the right to reside and settle in the country as guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(e). The Government of India thus has power to expel foreigners from India.8 (c) RESTRICTING MOVEMENT TO MAINTAIN PUBLIC ORDER The Punjab Akalis threatened to hold a demonstration in Delhi on the occasion of the inauguration of Asian games. To frustrate such demonstration, the Governments of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh took stringent measures, such as, barricading highways, resorting to seizure and arrests, intercepting movement of Akalis across the border on to Delhi. These steps were challenged through a writ petition in the Supreme Court. The Court laid down some general norms as to how the police should behave in such a situation. The police is entitled to impose reasonable restraints on the physical movement of the members of the public in order to protect public property and avoid needless inconvenience to other citizens in their lawful pursuits. But all such restraints on personal liberty have to be commensurate with the object which furnishes their justification. These should be minimal and ought not to exceed the constraints of the particular situation, either in nature or in duration. Above all, these cannot be used as engines of oppression, persecution and harassment. The sanctity of person and privacy has to be maintained at all costs and ought not to be violated in the name of maintenance of law and order. The rule of law requires that no one is to be subjected to harsh, uncivilised or discriminatory treatment even when the objective is the securing of the paramount exigencies of law and order.9 (d) WEARING HELMETS A rule was made under the Motor Vehicles Act requiring compulsory wearing of helmet by a person driving a scooter or a motor cycle. The rule was challenged as infringing the free movement of the driver of a two wheeler guaranteed under Art. 19(1)(d), but the Court refused to accept the argument. The Court maintained that the rule has been framed for the benefit and welfare of, and safe journey by, a person driving a two wheeler vehicle. The rule is made to prevent accidents not to curtail freedom of movement. Even if it be assumed that the rule does put some restriction on the freedom of movement, it is justifiable under Art. 19(5) as a reasonable restriction in the interest of the general public.10 (e) EXTERNMENT Articles 19(1)(d) and 19(1)(e) have been invoked frequently to challenge the validity of an externment order served by the executive on a citizen requiring him to leave a State or a district. Such an order prima facie curtails the freedoms guaranteed by these Articles, and, therefore, the Courts are entitled to test whether the order, and the law under which it has been made, are reasonable within Art. 19(5). An externment order was challenged on the ground that it was not a reasoned order. The Supreme Court rejected the challenge pointing out that there is a certain brand of lawless elements in society whom it is impossible to bring to book by established methods of judicial trial because the legal evidence essential for conviction is impossible to obtain. For fear of reprisals, witnesses are unwilling to depose in public against Page 1169 such characters. So, in the externment order against such a person, and in the disposal of appeal against that order, the concerned authority is not bound to give reasons or to write a reasoned order. The externee is only entitled to be informed of the general nature of the material allegations.11 The district magistrate of Delhi, empowered by the East Punjab Safety Act, 1949, served an externment order on Khare asking him to immediately remove himself from Delhi and not to return there for three months. The Act in question empowered the State Government, or the district magistrate, to make an order of externment on being satisfied that such an order was necessary to prevent a person from acting in any manner prejudicial to public safety or maintenance of public order. The satisfaction was 'final' and not open to judicial review. A district magistrate's order could not remain in force for more than three months while that of the government could last for an indefinite period.",

    "content": "Khare,12 the Supreme Court held the above-mentioned provision valid pointing out the several safeguards subject to which the executive could pass an order of externment, e.g., the district magistrate could not extern a person from his district, and the government could not extern a person from the State and this was a great safeguard; the grounds on which an externment order was made had to be communicated to the externee by the authority making the order, and if the order was to remain in force for more than three months, he had a right to make a representation which was to be referred to an advisory board constituted under the Act. It may be noted however that the opinion of the board was only of a recommendatory nature and not binding on the government. Under the Bombay Police Act, the Commissioner of Police could direct a person to remove himself from Greater Bombay for a period up to two years if--(i) the Commissioner was satisfied that his acts were calculated to cause alarm or danger to person or property, or that he was about to commit an offence involving violence or force; and (ii) in his opinion, witnesses were not forthcoming to testify against him in public. The person concerned had some procedural safeguards: he was to have in writing the main allegations against him: he was to have an opportunity to explain the allegations; he could appear through a lawyer and produce witnesses to clear his character. He could appeal to the State Government against the externment order and could resort to a Court on certain grounds. The Supreme Court held in Hari13 that the law was valid vis-à-vis Art. 19(5) as the restrictions had been imposed to protect the public from dangerous and bad characters; there were many safeguards, and the maximum time-limit for an externment order could only be two years.5 An argument was taken against the validity of the law that there was no advisory board to scrutinize the material on which the authority took action against the person concerned. The Supreme Court rejected the argument with the remark that there was no universal rule that the absence of an advisory board would necessarily make such legislation unconstitutional. Another argument advanced against the validity of the law was that the case against the externee was initiated by the police and it was the police itself who was the judge in the case. The Court rejected the contention arguing that whereas the case could be initiated by an inspector of police, the order of externment could be made only by the Commissioner of Police. A safeguard available in the law was that an appeal against the order lay to the State Government and a reference could be made to the Courts on some points. A State law authorised the district magistrate to require a person to live, or not to live, at a particular place, or to notify his movements, in the interests of security of the State or public order. Although there were adequate procedural safeguards, nevertheless, the Supreme Court declared the law unreasonable mainly on the ground that it required a person to reside at any place, without giving him a hearing before selecting a place for him. A place could be selected for him where he might not have any residential accommodation or means of subsistence. There was no provision for providing him with residence or means of livelihood in the place selected for him for his residence.14 Page 1170 Another law authorised the district magistrate, in an area declared by the State Government as disturbed, to direct a 'goonda' not to remain within, or enter into, a specified part of the district, if he was satisfied that his presence was prejudicial to the interests of the general public. Adequate procedural safeguards were provided but the Supreme Courtdeclared the Act invalid on the ground inter alia that the definition of a 'goonda' afforded no assistance to deciding who fell in that category. 'Goonda' had been defined as meaning a hooligan, rouge or a vagabond and included a person who was dangerous to public peace or tranquillity. This was an inclusive definition; it did not indicate any tests to be applied to decide whether a person fell in the first part of the definition, and it was left to the unguided discretion of the magistrate to treat any citizen as a goonda which was hardly proper.15 The Court insisted that the Act must have clearly indicated when and under what circumstances a person could be called a 'goonda'. In Prem Chand v. Union of India, 16 the Court has adopted a very strict approach on the question of externment. The Court has characterised exterment of a person as \"economic harakari and psychic distress\". The Court has emphasized that externment provisions have to be read strictly and that any \"police apprehension is not enough. Some ground or other is not adequate. There must be a clear and present danger based upon creditable material which makes the movements and acts of the person in question alarming or dangerous or fraught with violence\". Natural justice must be fairly complied with. In the instant case, the Supreme Courtquashed the externment proceedings by the police against the petitioner (under the Delhi Police Act, 1978) on the ground of misuse of power and laid down the following guidelines for the use of such a power:17 \"There must be a clear and present danger based upon credible material which makes the movements and acts of the person in question alarming or dangerous or fraught with violence. Likewise, there must be sufficient reason to believe that the person proceeded against is so desperate and dangerous that his mere presence in Delhi or any part thereof is hazardous to its community and its safety....",

    "content": "there must be sufficient reason to believe that the person proceeded against is so desperate and dangerous that his mere presence in Delhi or any part thereof is hazardous to its community and its safety.... Natural justice must be fairly complied with and vague allegations and secret hearings are gross violations of Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution...\" It will be appreciated that the Court has shown a tougher attitude in this case than in the Bombay case mentioned above. In the instant case, the restriction could be imposed only in a disturbed area and only on a 'goonda'. There were no such restrictions in the Bombay Act under which any person could be externed and this was much broader than the term 'goonda' howsoever vaguely it might have been defined. The discretion conferred in the Bombay Act was, therefore, much broader than in the instant case but still while the Bombay Act had been held valid, the Act in the instant case was declared invalid. The above cases appear to establish the proposition that a person can be externed from a local area on the grounds mentioned in Art. 19(5). The power to make such an order may be left to the subjective satisfaction of an administrative officer, subject to some substantive and procedural safeguards. The grounds served on an externee should not be vague, indefinite or incomplete and they should have a direct bearing on the purposes for which an externment order can be made under the relevant law. The externee should be given an opportunity to make a representation or of being heard against the order of externment. This appears to be the minimal procedural safeguard which should be given to the externee.18 (f) DEPORTATION Article 19(1) (e) has also been used to challenge deportation of Indian citizens out of the country and, in this area, the Supreme Court has limited the powers of the executive a great deal. This judicial approach is illustrated by the following cases. When the residence visa permit of a person who entered India on the basis of a valid permit was cancelled, the Supreme Court held that having regard to the fact that he has entered the country legally, the competent authority must inform him of the reasons for his proposed deportation. The reasons must be sufficient to enable the petitioner to make effective representation and only after considering the representation, the competent authority may pass an appropriate order. The Court however observed that the procedure may be departed from for compelling reasons.19 Page 1171 A Central law authorised the Central Government to direct the removal from India of any person against whom a reasonable suspicion existed of having entered India without a permit, or on an invalid permit, or committing a breach of a condition of the permit. The Supreme Court held the provision invalid in its relation to the Indian citizens. While an Indian citizen guilty of serious prejudicial acts like espionage or disloyalty to his country, may render himself liable to the gravest penalty, it would be repugnant to all notions of democracy, and inconsistent with his Fundamental Rights, to expel him from the country for any other reason. This amounts to destroying his citizenship which could be done only by taking recourse to Art. 11.20 Further, a person could be externed when the government entertained a reasonable suspicion that an offence had been committed under the Act. Thus, the question whether an offence had been committed or not was left entirely to the 'arbitrary and unrestrained discretion' of the government. A person could thus be removed merely on suspicion without giving him a reasonable opportunity to clear his conduct and this was nothing short of a travesty of the right of citizenship. A forfeiture of citizenship on suspicion of committing a breach of permit regulations could hardly be regarded as a reasonable restriction on the Fundamental Right to reside and settle in the country.21 According to a Passport rule, no person could enter India without a valid passport. An Indian citizen entered the country without a passport and he was fined for committing the offence. Holding the rule valid, the Supreme Court stated that it is a proper restriction upon entry of an Indian citizen returning from a foreign country to require him to produce a passport.22 But it will be a different matter to say that if he enters India without a passport he may be deported from India. Such an order will be bad under the Ebrahim Vazir ruling. (g) POLICE SURVEILLANCE Since the pre-independence days, there have been in operation in some of the States, some police regulations providing for police surveillance of activities of persons suspected of criminal habits or tendencies. This includes secret picketing of the house, domiciliary visits at nights, and shadowing the movements of the suspect. The purpose of police surveillance is prevention of commission of crimes by such persons. The validity of such regulations with reference to Art. 19(1)(d) was first considered by the Supreme Court in Kharak Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh .23 The Court ruled by a majority that no aspect of police surveillance fell within the scope of Art. 19(1)(d). The purpose of secret picketing was only to identify the visitors to the suspect so that police might have some idea of his activities and this did not affect his right of movement in any material form. Against the validity of shadowing of the suspect's movements, it was argued that if a person suspected that his movements were being watched by the police, it would induce in him a psychological inhibition against movement and this would infringe Art. 19(1)(d) which should be interpreted as postulating freedom not only from physical, but even psychological, restraints on a person's movement. Rejecting this argument which advocated too broad a view of the scope of the safeguard guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(d), the Court ruled that Art.",

    "content": "which should be interpreted as postulating freedom not only from physical, but even psychological, restraints on a person's movement. Rejecting this argument which advocated too broad a view of the scope of the safeguard guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(d), the Court ruled that Art. 19(1)(d) guarantees freedom from physical, direct and tangible restraints; it has no reference to 'mere personal sensitiveness', or 'the imponderable effect on the mind of a person which might guide his action in the matter of his movement or locomotion'. On the same view, domiciliary visits were also held to fall outside the scope of Art. 19(1)(d) as a knock at the door, or rousing a man from his sleep, does not impede or prejudice his locomotion in any manner. The minority view, on the other hand, was that all acts of surveillance result in a close observation of a suspect's movements which infringes Art. 19(1)(d). If a man is shadowed, his movements are constricted. \"He can move physically, but it can only be a movement of an automation.\" Needless to say, in Kharak Singh, the majority took too restrictive a view of Art. 19(1)(d) and that the minority view contained a lot of truth. The flaw in the majority view was that if there was no physical restraint on a person's movements, then the reasonableness of police surveillance could not be scrutinised vis-à-vis Art. 19(1)(d). This flaw has now been removed by the Supreme Court by its pronouncement in Govind v. State of Madhya Pradesh .24 The Court has now held that police surveillance will have to be restricted to such persons only against whom reasonable materials exist to induce the opinion that they show 'a determination Page 1172 to lead a life of crime'--'crime in this context being confined to such as involve public peace or security only and if they are dangerous to security risks.' Similarly domiciliary visits and secret picketing by the police should be restricted to clearest cases of danger to community security and should not be resorted to as routine follow-up at the end of a conviction or release from prison or at the whim of a police officer. The Court administered a warning that these old regulations 'ill-accord with the essence of personal freedom,' verge 'perilously near unconstitutionality' and, therefore, need to be revised. The Supreme Court has reiterated in Malak Singh v. State of Punjab25 that police can maintain discreet surveillance over reputed bad characters, habitual offenders and other potential offenders in order to maintain public peace and prevent commission of offences. However, intrusive surveillance seriously encroaching on a citizen's privacy is not permissible under Arts. 19(1)(d) and 21. (h) RIGHT TO PRIVACY An interesting question considered by the Court in these cases is whether there is in India a fundamental Right to privacy. In the Kharak Singh case,26 the Supreme Court ruled definitively that the 'right to privacy' was not a guaranteed right in India. But in Govind,27 the Court appears to have accepted a limited Fundamental Right to privacy 'as an emanation' from Arts. 19(1)(a), (d) and 21. The right to privacy is not, however, absolute, and reasonable restrictions can be placed thereon in public interest under Art. 19(5). The impugned police regulations were characterised as making 'drastic inroads directly into the privacy' and 'indirectly into the Fundamental Rights,' of the suspect and, therefore, they were given a restrictive operation as stated above. A further discussion is held on the right to privacy later under Art. 21.28 (i) ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRETION A review of the cases concerning Arts. 19(1)(c), (d) and (e) will reveal that there appears to be a difference in judicial attitude towards the permissible limits of administrative discretion to curtail the Fundamental Rights of 'association', 'movement' or 'residence'. The right of association is better protected for the administrative authority cannot be empowered to restrict the right finally in its discretion; some kind of judicial scrutiny should be provided for.29 In other cases, judicial review may not be necessary over administrative discretion. It is also interesting to note the variable judicial attitude to the adequacy of an advisory board (provided for in preventive detention cases),30 as a control mechanism over administrative discretion. In case of right of association, the Supreme Court has said that since there is an advisory board in preventive detention cases, it does not mean that it will be sufficient in cases of restraint on the right of association as well. On the other hand, in cases of restraint on the right of 'movement or residence', the Court has stated that advisory board is not necessary in such cases just because there is one in preventive detention cases. The dichotomy in judicial attitude may be because of the realisation that in a democracy right of 'association' should be protected effectively as that is the basis of organisation of political parties. H. RIGHT TO PROPERTY: ARTICLES 19(1)(F)AND 19(5) Article 19(1)(f) guaranteed to the Indian citizens a right to acquire, hold and dispose of property. Art. 19(5), however, permitted the state to impose by law reasonable restrictions on this right in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe. Arts. 19(1)(f) and 19(5) have been repealed by the Constitution (Forty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1979.31 Some aspects of Art. 19(1)(f) have been discussed later under the Right to Property.32 I. FREEDOM TO CARRY ON TRADE AND COMMERCE: ARTS. 19(1)(g)AND 19(6) Page 1173 (a) ARTICLE 19(1)(G) Article 19(1)(g) guarantees to all citizens the right to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. Under Art. 19(6), however, the state is not prevented from making a law imposing, in the interests of the general public, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the above right.",

    "content": "Art. 19(6), however, the state is not prevented from making a law imposing, in the interests of the general public, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the above right. Nor is the state prevented from making-- (i) a law relating to professional or technical qualifications necessary for practising a profession or carrying on any occupation, trade or business; or (ii) a law relating to the carrying on by the state, or by corporation owned or controlled by it, of any trade, business, industry or service, whether to the exclusion, complete or partial, of citizens or otherwise. For long India has believed in a regulated and planned economy and not in a laissez faire economy. A number of constitutional provisions made under the title of \"Directive Principles of State Policy\" bear testimony to this economic philosophy.33 'Reasonable restrictions' on trade, commerce or business have to be assessed keeping this factor in mind. Consequently, the right to carry on trade is very much regulated in India and the Courts have upheld, in course of time, a good deal of social control over private enterprise.34 By and large it is correct to say that despite Art. 19(1)(g), the government enjoys power to regulate and order the economy in any way it pleases. In 1978, by the 44th Amendment of the Constitution, the word 'socialist' has been introduced in the Preamble to the Constitution characterising India as 'sovereign socialist secular democratic Republic'.35 Does the addition of the word 'socialist' mean that the Courts should sanction a more rigorous social control of trade and commerce? Should the Courts lean more and more in favour of nationalisation and state ownership of industries? Should the concept of socialism and social justice be pushed to such an extreme as to ignore entirely the interests of private enterprise? The Supreme Court sought to answer these questions in Excel Wear v. Union of India .36 The Court emphasized that while there may be greater emphasis on nationalisation and state ownership of industries, private ownership of industries is recognised; private enterprise forms an overwhelmingly large proportion of India's economic structure. Limited companies having shareholders own a large number of industries. There are creditors and depositors and various other persons having dealings with the undertakings. Socialism cannot go to the extent of ignoring the interests of all such persons. A private sector undertaking differs from a public sector undertaking. When the latter closes down, it can protect the labour even at the cost of the public exchequer. But a private undertaking is run for return to the owner not only to meet his livelihood or expenses but also for the formation of capital for growth of the national economy. The Court has posed the question: Does it stand to reason that by rigorous restrictions all these interests should be completely or substantially ignored? The Court has said: \"The questions posed are suggestive of the answers.\"37 In the application of the Fundamental Right to carry on business, the Court has permitted the invoking of the principle of \"level playing field\", subject however, to the doctrine of public interest. The Court has taken note of the fact that \"level playing field\" is an important factor to be kept in mind and this factor is embodied in Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.38 For some time now the trend has been undergoing a change. Instead of nationalisation, the trend has shifted to privatisation. Instead of government control over trade and commerce, the emphasis now is to relax government control. The government has come to view its role more as a facilitator, rather than as a controller, of private enterprise. From the case law, one can see that, hitherto, the orientation of the Courts has been favourable to state control. One can visualise that the present-day liberal trend will manifest itself in the case-law arising in future. Article 19(1)(g) uses four expressions, viz., profession, occupation, trade and business. Their fields may overlap but each of these expressions has a content of its own distinct from the others. The Fundamental Right to establish educational institution as contained in Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India would, however, be subject only to the reasonable restrictions which may be imposed by any law in Page 1174 terms of clause (6) thereof.39 (b) STATE MONOPOLY Article 19(6)(ii) (see above) enables the state to make laws for creating state monoplies either partially or complete in respect of any trade or business or industry or service. The state may enter into any trade like any other person either for administrative reasons, or with the object of mitigating the evils in the trade, or even for the purpose of making profits in order to enrich the exchequer. The law relating to such trading activities must be presumed to be reasonable and in the interest of general public. This was the view taken by the Supreme Court in Akadasi,40 where the Court observed that the law relating to such state monopoly should be presumed to be reasonable and in the interest of general public within the scope of Art. 19(6)(ii). The state is not required to justify its trade monopoly as a 'reasonable' restriction and as being in the 'interests of the general public'.41 It is presumed to be so. No objection can be taken under Art. 19(1)(g) if the state carries on a business either as a monopoly, complete or partial, to the exclusion of all or some citizens only, or in competition with any citizen.42 Thus, the right of the citizens to carry on a trade has been subordinated to the right of the state to create a monopoly in its favour.43 Article 19(6) (ii) is a saving provision; its function is not to create a power, but to immunize the exercise of legislative power falling within its ambit from being attacked under Art. 19(1)(g).44 Art. 19(6)(ii) does not envisage that a State can carry on a trade only under its own law and not under a law made by Parliament.",

    "content": "Art. 19(6)(ii) does not envisage that a State can carry on a trade only under its own law and not under a law made by Parliament. Parliament has power to create trading monopolies in the States under entry 21 in the Concurrent List.45 Reference may also be made in this connection to Art. 298, according to which the Union and each State has power to carry on any trade or commerce.46 In Akadasi,47 the Supreme Court upheld the validity of an Orissa Law conferring monopoly rights on the State in the matter of trade in kendu leaves. Nevertheless, the Court restricted the scope of the protection under Art. 19(6)(ii). The Court ruled that Art. 19(6)(ii) protects only those statutory provisions which are \"basically and essentially\" necessary for creating the State monopoly and not such provisions as are only 'subsidiary, incidental, or helpful' to the operation of the State monopoly. Such subsidiary provisions are not immunized by Art. 19(6)(ii) and they would have to satisfy the twin tests of 'reasonableness' and 'public interest' as laid down in Art. 19(6). In Akadasi, the provisions dealing with the fixation of the price at which the kendu leaves were to be purchased from the growers were treated as incidental and, thus, held to be grossly unfair contravening the rights of the growers under Art. 19(1)(f). Thus, before a law can get immunity under Art. 19(6)(ii), the Court has to apply a kind of value judgment, separate the 'essential' monopolistic provisions from the 'non-essential', and test the validity of the latter under Art. 19(6) like that of any other ordinary law restricting trade and commerce.48 Further, under Art. 19(6)(ii), a State may create monopoly in its own favour but not in favour of third persons for their benefit.49 The latter law has to fulfil the normal requirements of Art. 19(1)(g) read with Art. 19(6). When monopoly in kendu leaves was given to certain agents appointed by the State, but those persons were free from government control and the profit was theirs and not of the State, the Supreme Court held that those persons were not really agents of the concerned State within Art. 19(6)(ii).50 Reiterating this principle, the Supreme Court emphasized that the monopoly created by the State in favour of third parties is different from a monopoly created by the State in its own favour. \"The profit resulting from the sale must be for public benefit and not for private gain.\" The test thus is whether the entire benefit arising from the monopoly enures to the State. Monopoly in a commodity may be valid if it is only for the benefit of the State. It should not serve the private interests of any one person or class of persons.51 State monopoly ought not to be used as a cloak for conferring private benefit upon a limited class of persons.52 A government policy to purchase certain medicines for government hospitals from public sector manufacturers only was held not to amount to a monopoly. The policy does not prohibit other manufacturers from manufacturing and selling their products to other consumers. The government's requirement for drugs is Page 1175 very limited. There is a lot of public demand for drugs in the open market from other consumers. The Supreme Court has observed in this regard in the undernoted case:53 \"Monopoly as contemplated under Art. 19(6) of the Constitution is something to the total exclusion of others. Creation of a small captive market in favour of a State-owned undertaking out of a larger market can hardly be treated as creation of monopoly as contemplated under Art. 19(6) of the Constitution, more so because this captive market consists only of State owned hospitals and dispensaries. Thus, on facts... there is no monopoly created by the impugned policy.\" When prohibition is only with respect to the exercise of the right referable only in a particular area of activity or relating to particular matters, there is no total prohibition. Hence, when total prohibition is imposed on the slaughter of cow and her progeny the ban is total with regard to slaughter of one particular class of cattle and is not on total activity of butchers as they are left free to slaughter cattle other than those specified in impugned Act.54 Again where a municipality by its resolution prohibited the issue of certain receipts and passes to commission agents on behalf of owners of grain, but not restricting their entry into the market on legitimate business, it was held that the resolution merely prohibited employees of the municipality from issuing such receipts and passes but did not prevent them from carrying on business as an Adatya of a seller of grain which could be considered as a restriction but not a total prohibition.55 (c) TRADE: MEANING OF The guarantee in Art. 19(1)(g) extends to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. Art. 19(1)(g) uses four different expressions so as to make the guarantee in Art. 19(1)(g) as comprehensive as possible and to include all avenues and modes through which a person earns his livelihood. Nevertheless, Art. 19(1)(g) protects only such activities which are of a commercial or a trading nature. Any activity not regarded as trade or business falls outside the purview of this protection. This means that the validity of a law regulating any such activity need not be decided upon by the yardstick of reasonableness and public interest as laid down in Art. 19(6). Thus, a judicial technique to promote rigorous government control of some activities is to refuse to characterise them as trading or commercial activities because of considerations of public morality, public interest, or their harmful and dangerous character. Plying motor vehicles,56 or rickshaws57 on public pathways have been held to be trade and commerce. (d) LIQUOR TRADE The judicial opinion on the question whether liquor trade is trade or not for the purposes of Art. 19(1)(g) has taken time to stabilize.",

    "content": "motor vehicles,56 or rickshaws57 on public pathways have been held to be trade and commerce. (d) LIQUOR TRADE The judicial opinion on the question whether liquor trade is trade or not for the purposes of Art. 19(1)(g) has taken time to stabilize. An early as 1954, in Cooverji,58 the Supreme Court ruled that no one has an inherent right to sell intoxicating liquors in retail sale. A citizen has no such privilege. As it is a business which is dangerous to the community, the State may entirely prohibit it or permit it under conditions. The manner and extent of regulation rest within the discretion of the State. Again, in Krishan Kumar v. State of Jammu & Kashmir, 59 the Supreme Court refused to countenance the argument that dealing in noxious and dangerous goods like liquor was dangerous to the community and subversive of its morals and, therefore, was not trade. The Court stated that the acceptance of such a broad argument \"involves the position that the meaning of the expression 'trade or business' depends upon, and varies with, the general acceptance of the standards of morality obtaining at a particular point of time in our country\". The Court was of the view that while standards of morality could afford guidance to impose restrictions, they could not limit the scope of the right. The morality or illegality or otherwise of a deal would not affect the quality or character of the activity though it might be a ground for imposing a restriction on the activity. However, the judicial view underwent a fundamental change in course of time. In Nashirwar v. State of Page 1176 Madhya Pradesh, 60 the Supreme Court held that there was no Fundamental Right to carry on trade in liquor because of the reasons of public morality, public interest and harmful and dangerous character of liquor. The Court ruled that \"there is the police power of the state to enforce public morality to prohibit trades in noxious or dangerous goods\". Reference was also made to Art. 47 a Directive Principle, in support of this view.61 In Har Shankar,62 after reviewing the previous case-law, the Court observed: \"There is no Fundamental Right to do trade or business in intoxicants. The state under its regulatory powers, has the right to prohibit absolutely every form of activity in relation to intoxicants--its manufacture, storage, export, import, sale and possession.\" Again, in Khoday Distilleries,63 the Court observed that a citizen has no Fundamental Right to trade or business in intoxicating liquors and that trade or business in such liquors can be completely prohibited. Because of its pernicious and vicious nature, dealing in intoxicating liquors is considered to be res extra commercium. The state can create a monopoly either in itself or in an agency created by it for manufacture, possession, sale and distribution of liquor as a beverage. The state can impose restrictions, limitations and even prohibition on intoxicating liquors.64 Alternatively the Court has argued in McDowell,65 that even if it were to be argued that trade in intoxicating liquors falls within the scope of Art. 19(1)(g), the State could still impose severe restrictions, or even prohibition, on the trade in intoxicating liquors. Art. 47 expressly speaks of the obligation of the state to endeavour to bring about prohibition of the consumption of intoxicating liquors. Therefore, imposing prohibition is to achieve the directive principle adumbrated in Art. 47. Such a course merits to be treated as a reasonable restriction within the meaning of Art. 19(6). Thus, whichever line of thought one adopts, an Act imposing prohibition on manufacture, production, consumption and sale of intoxicating drinks is valid. Liquor trade may thus be subjected to rigorous control. Restrictions which may not be lawful in case of other trades may be permissible as regards the liquor trade. Even prohibition of the liquor trade may be regarded permissible and lawful. The state has complete right of controlling any aspect of the liquor trade. The state has exclusive right to manufacture and sell liquor. The state can sell its right to raise revenue, and the consideration charged by the state for this purpose is neither tax not fee but is like rental.66 The state can sell its right by public auction or private negotiation. Whatever has been said here in relation to liquor trade applies with equal force to trade in all intoxicants and nauseous drinks.67 A caveat may, however, be added here. Although, regulation of liquor trade may fall outside Art. 19(1)(g), Art. 14 can still be invoked if a restriction imposed on liquor trade is found to be arbitrary, irrational or unreasonable.68 (e) BETTING AND GAMBLING The Supreme Court has refused to characterise many other activities as trade for purposes of Art. 19(1)(g). Prize chits serve no social purpose but are prejudicial to public interests as they exploit the poor people and so these can be totally banned.69 Betting and gambling have been held to be not trade and so fall outside the purview of Art. 19(1)(g), as gambling activities from their very nature and in essence \"are extra commercium although the external forms, formalities and instruments of trade may be employed\".70 Prize competitions involving substantial skill are regarded as business activities. On the other hand, a prize competition which is of a gambling nature would not fall within the protection of Art. 19(1)(g).71 (f) OTHER TRADES In Krishnachandra v. State of Madhya Pradesh, the Court considered the reasonableness of the Gambling Act under Art. 19(1)(g) as if gambling was trade and the Court did not take the stand, as it had done earlier, that gambling was not protected by Art. 19(1)(g).72 The Calcutta High Court has ruled that Art. 19(1)(g) does not guarantee the Fundamental Right to carry on trade or business which generates pollution.",

No one has a Fundamental Right to manufacture, sell and deal in fireworks which produce sound beyond permissible limits, or which generates pollution which would endanger health and public order.73 Page 1177 The Supreme Court has declared that no one can claim a Fundamental Right to carry on business in adulterated foodstuffs thus implying that it is not a trade for purposes of Art. 19(1)(g).74 Money-lending to poor villagers has been held to be not trade and commerce as it is exploitative of the village people. Such an activity has been considered as 'anti-social, usurious, unscrupulous'. On the other hand, money-lending amongst the commercial community is trade as it is integral to trade and commerce.75 A contract between an individual and a government is not protected by Art. 19(1)(g). If the government infringes the contract, the individual may sue for damages or specific performance, but he cannot argue that he has been deprived of his Fundamental Right to carry on trade and commerce guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(g).76 The Supreme Court has ruled in Unni Krishnan,77 that establishing educational institutions cannot be regarded as trade or commerce falling under Art. 19(1)(g). Imparting education cannot be allowed to become commerce. Trade or business normally connotes an activity carried on for a profit motive. Imparting of education has never been regarded as commerce in India. Private educational institutions are a necessity of the day as the government alone cannot meet the demand for education particularly in the sector of medical and technical education which calls for huge outlays. In this case, the Court was faced with the question--how to encourage private educational institutions without allowing them to commercialize education.78 Establishing and administering an educational institution for imparting knowledge to students is an occupation, protected by Article 19(1) (g) and additionally by Article 26(a), if there is no element of profit generation. Although imparting education has also become a means of livelihood for some professionals and a mission in life for some altruists and is characterized as an occupation, yet it does not cease to be a service to the society and cannot be equated to a trade or a business. Teaching may however be regarded as a profession falling under art. 19(1)(g). The law regulating to local administration of an urban or rural area affects the social and economic life of the community. The reasonableness of complete restriction imposed on trade of non vegetarian food items has, therefore, to be viewed from the cultural and religious background of the three municipal towns of Haridwar, Rishikesh and Muni ki Reti. Therefore, the impugned bye-law notified by the Municipal Board, Rishikesh which prohibited the sale and consumption of eggs within the limits of the Municipal Board was not violative of Art. 19(1)(g) cannot be held to be violative of Article 19(1) (g).79 (g) ARTS. 19(1)(G)AND 301 Article 301 also guarantees freedom of trade. The scope of Art. 301 and its relation with Art. 19(1)(g) has been discussed earlier.80 A provision infringing Arts. 301 and 304 may, and ordinarily will, infringe Art. 19(1)(g) as well and so it can be challenged under Art. 19(1)(g).81 J. RESTRICTIONS ON TRADE AND COMMERCE In several cases, the Courts have upheld measures affecting trade and commerce to some extent, on the ground that they do not constitute restrictions on the Fundamental Right concerned. Reasonableness of restriction is to be determined in an objective manner and from the standpoint of interest of the general public and not from the standpoint of the interests of persons upon whom the restrictions have been imposed or upon abstract considerations. A restriction cannot be said to be unreasonable merely because in a given case, it operates harshly. In determining whether there is any unfairness involved, the nature of the right alleged to have been infringed, the underlying purpose of the restriction imposed, the extent and urgency of the evil sought to be remedied thereby, the disproportion of the imposition, the prevailing condition at the relevant time enter into judicial verdict. The reasonableness of the legitimate expectation has to be determined with respect to the circumstances relating to the trade or business in question. Canalisation of a particular business in favour of even a specified individual is reasonable where Page 1178 the interest of the country are concerned or where the business affects the economy of the country.82 In Ram Jawaya v. State of Punjab, 83 the government scheme to nationalise school text books was held valid under Art. 19(1)(g) because the private publishers' right to print and publish any book they liked and offer the same for sale, was not curtailed. The choice of text books for the recognised schools lay with the government and the publishers had no Fundamental Right to have any of their books prescribed as a text book by the school authorities. The Government of Kerala directed that the farmers getting assistance from it for purchase of pumpsets had to purchase them from government approved pump dealers. The private dealers challenged the direction as violation of their right under Art. 19(1)(g), but the Supreme Court rejected the contention. The Court ruled that no one has the \"Fundamental Right to insist upon the government or any other individual for doing business with him.\" A government or an individual is free to determine with whom it will do business. The government has every right to select dealers of its choice for delivering of pump sets keeping in view the price and after sale service and this cannot be challenged as an unreasonable restriction under Art. 19(1)(g) read with Art. 19(6).84 A regulation of trade and commerce becomes challengeable under Art. 19(1)(g), if it is shown that it directly and proximately interferes in praesenti with the exercise of freedom of trade.",

If the alleged restriction does not directly or proximately interfere with the exercise of freedom of trade, the freedom guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(g) is not violated.85 Once it is assumed that the impugned legislation imposes a restriction on the freedom of trade, the burden is on those who support it to show that the restriction imposed is reasonable and in the interest of general public. The burden is on those who seek the protection of Art. 19(6) and not on the citizen who challenges the restriction as invalid.86 The Supreme Court has also emphasized that \"the greater the restriction, the more the need for strict scrutiny by the Court\".87 (a) REASONABLE RESTRICTION : WHAT IS? What is a 'reasonable restriction' under Art. 19(6)?88 Reasonableness of a restriction has to be tested both from procedural as well as substantive aspects of the law. In order to determine the reasonableness of the restrictions, regard must be had to the nature of the business and the conditions prevailing in the trade. These factors differ from trade to trade and no hard and fast rules concerning all trades can be laid down.89 Further, a restriction on a trade or business is unreasonable if it is arbitrary or drastic and has no relation to, or goes much in excess of, the objective of the law which seeks to impose it. As early as 1951, in Chintaman Rao,90 the Supreme Court laid down the test for a \"reasonable restriction\" as follows: \"The phrase reasonable restriction cannotes that the limitation imposed on a person in enjoyment of the right should not be arbitrary or of an excessive nature beyond what is required in the interest of the public. The word reasonable implies intelligent care and deliberation, that is, the choice of a course which reason dictates. Legislation which arbitrarily or excessively invades the right cannot be said to contain the quality of reasonableness and unless it strikes a proper balance between the freedom guaranteed in article 19(1)(g) and the social control permitted by clause (6) of Article 19, it must be held to be wanting in that quality.\"91 The Court has further explained the concept of \"reasonableness\" as envisaged in Art. 19(6) in Krishnan:92 \"The reasonableness of restriction is to be determined in an objective manner and from the standpoint of the interests of general public and not from the standpoint of the interests of the persons upon whom the restrictions are imposed or upon abstract consideration. A restriction cannot be said to be unreasonable merely because in a given case, it operates harshly... In determining the infringement of the right guaranteed under Art. 19(1)(g), the nature of right alleged to have been infringed, the underlying purpose of the restriction imposed, the extent and urgency of the evil sought to be remedied thereby, the disproportion of the imposition, the prevailing conditions at the time, enter into judicial verdict.\" Thus, restrictions to be reasonable must not be arbitrary or excessive in nature so as to go beyond the interest of general public. This formulation involves a balancing of private interest vis-a-vis public interest. In Page 1179 this process, the Courts have leaned towards the consumers' interests. Thus, while far-reaching restrictions are imposed on trade and commerce, only rarely will a restriction be held as unreasonable. It has since been held that in judging the reasonableness of the restrictions imposed by Art. 19(6), the Court has to bear in mind the Directive Principles.1 In Sivani,2 the Supreme Court has laid down the criteria to evaluate the reasonableness of a restriction under Art. 19(6). The Court must take into account whether the law has struck a proper balance between social control, on the one hand, and the right of the individual on the other. The Court has to take into account such factors as, nature of the right enshrined, underlying purpose of the restriction imposed, evil sought to be remedied by the law, its extent and urgency, how far the restriction is or is not proportionate to the evil and the prevailing conditions at the time. The Court cannot proceed on any abstract or general notion of what is reasonable. The Court cannot judge reasonableness of a restriction from the point of view of one person or a class of persons on whom the restriction may be imposed. In the context of the Lotteries (Regulation) Act 1988 the Supreme Court has held that if by a statutory action the rights of an agent to carry on business is affected, he may in his own right maintain an action. A quia time application is also maintainable if his right in any manner to carry on business is infringed or is a threatened.3 To adjudge the reasonableness of the restriction, regard must be had to the nature of the business, and the conditions prevailing therein which would differ from trade to trade. No hard and fast rules covering all trades can be laid down. The nature of the business and its indelible effect on public interest etc. are important elements in deciding reasonableness of therestriction. No one has inherent right to carry on a business which is injurious to public interest. Trade or business attended with danger to the community may be totally prohibited or be permitted subject to such conditions or restrictions as would prevent the evils to the utmost. (b) CAN RESTRICTION AMOUNT TO A PROHIBITION? A question has arisen from time to time whether a restriction can amount to a prohibition.",

    "content": "position of the Supreme Court on this question has been that restriction may even amount to prohibition in a given case if the mischief to be remedied warrants total prohibition.4 In Narendra Kumar,5 the Supreme Court construed the term 'restriction' to include 'prohibition' and ruled that the reasonableness of such a restruction has to be considered \"in the background of the facts and circumstances under which the order was made, taking into account the nature of the evil that was sought to be remedied by such law, the ratio of the harm caused to individual citizens by the proposed remedy, to the beneficial effect reasonably expected to result to the general public\", and \"whether the restraint caused by the law was more than what was necessary in the interests of the general public.\" Even though total prohibition upon carrying on one's profession can be imposed by way of regulatory measure but for doing so such prohibition must pass through a stringent test of public interest.6 Rent Act, which imposes a limit on the rent which can be charged, would pass the test of reasonable restriction.7 The Court has again explained the position as follows in Mohd. Faruk:8 \"The Court must in considering the validity of the impugned law imposing a prohibition on the carrying on of a business or profession, attempt an evaluation of its direct and immediate impact upon the Fundamental Rights of the citizens affected thereby and the larger public interest sought to be ensured in the light of the object sought to be achieved, the necessity to restrict the citizen's freedom, the inherent pernicious nature of the act prohibited or its capacity or tendency to be harmful to the general public, the possibility of achieving the object by imposing a less drastic restraint and in the absence of exceptional situations such as the prevalence of a state of emergency--national or local--or the necessity to maintain essential supplies, or the necessity to stop activities inherently dangerous, the existence of a machinery to satisfy the administrative authority that no case for imposing the restriction is made out or that a less drastic restriction may ensure the object intended to be achieved.\" In Narendra Kumar, a total prohibition on copper dealers was held valid.9 In Systopic Laboratories,10 complete ban on manufacture and sale of certain medical formulations was held to be not an unreasonable Page 1180 restriction on the right to carry on trade under Art. 19(1)(g). The Central Government took the said decision on the recommendation of the Drugs Consultative Committee which had thoroughly studied the matter. Implementation of directive principles would be in the interest of the general public and, therefore, trades that are harmful or dangerous to the ecology may be regulated or totally prohibited.11 Although regulatory measures for better efficiency, conduct and behaviour in the public interest would be a reasonable restriction, but a total prohibition on a person from carrying on his profession at an age chosen by the Government would not be a reasonable restriction unless special reasons are shown to exist.12 The Court also expressed the view that the freedom of carrying on a profession should be enjoyed by the citizen to the fullest possible extent without putting \"shackles\" of avoidable cobweb of rules and regulations putting restrictions in the enjoyment of such freedoms. As such clause 17 of the conditions of licence issued by the Tourism Department of the State restricting the age of tourist guide as 60 years was held to be unconstitutional. Thus, it is clear from the above discussion that in certain circumstances, a restriction on trade may amount even to prohibition. As stated above, protection of Art. 19(1)(g) has already been withdrawn from trade in intoxicants.13 No person has any Fundamental Right to carry on trade in any noxious or dangerous goods like intoxicating drugs or intoxicating liquors.14 (c) MISCELLANEOUS SITUATIONS A State law prohibited the manufacture of bidis in the villages during the agricultural season. No person residing in the villages could employ any other person, nor engage himself, in the manufacture of bidis during the agricultural season. The object of the provision was to ensure adequate supply of labour for agricultural purposes. The bidi manufacturer could not even import labour from outside, and so had to suspend manufacture of bidis during the agricultural season. Even villagers incapable of engaging in agriculture, like old people, women and children, etc., who supplemented their income by making bidis in their spare time, were prohibited from engaging themselves in bidi manufacture without any reason. The prohibition was held to be unreasonable because it was in excess of the object in view and was drastic in nature.15 An order obligating wheat growers to dispose of excess wheat within 15 days was held unreasonable as it did not create any corresponding obligation whatever on any one to purchase wheat at a reasonable price.16 In order to curb the increasing menace of vehicle theft the central government devised a system of introducing High Security Registration Plates and accordingly issued the Motor Vehicles (New High Security Registration Plates) Order 2001. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highway left the discretion to the states in the matter of using Notice Inviting Tender (NIT) for supplying such plates. The petitioners challenged the conditions of NIT concerning experience and extent of business of the prospective bidders and the NIT stipulated that the bidders should be operating in at least five countries for licence plates and in atleast three countries having security features worldwide, with minimum annual turnover equivalent to must be from licence place business. The agreement is to subsist for a period of 15 years during which the bidder will be approved except in case of termination of contract. The petitioners challenged these conditions contending that the conditions concerning experience and extent of business are discriminatory and tailor made to suit the interest of a class of manufacturers having foreign collaboration and a cartel of companies.",

    "content": "petitioners challenged these conditions contending that the conditions concerning experience and extent of business are discriminatory and tailor made to suit the interest of a class of manufacturers having foreign collaboration and a cartel of companies. The State was well aware that only one or two companies could satisfy the eligibility conditions in the name of implementing Rule 50 requiring use of such number plates and in the process was taking away the rights of existing manufacturers violating their Fundamental Right under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution by eliminating individual manufacturers of plates. Rejecting the petitioner's plea, the Court held that the impugned clauses had been incorporated to ensure that the manufacturers are technically and financially competent to fulfill the contractual obligation. The know how was available outside India and the indigenous manufacturers are mostly those who have foreign collaboration. Keeping in mind the nature and magnitude of the job, the huge infrastructure required for nationwide implementation, the state's attempt to select foreign manufacturers having foreign collaboration and experience in foreign countries cannot be held to be discriminatory and even if one manufacturer is selected through open tender the said selection cannot be held to be creating monopoly or violative of Article Page 1181 19(g) read with Clause 6.17 With a view to stop production of Khandsari, a restriction was imposed by way of stopping the crushers for two months. The restriction was held valid in Laxmi Khandsari v. State of Uttar Pradesh18 as it was imposed with a view to stop production of Khandsari so as to promote production of white sugar and to make it available to the consumers at reasonable rates. The restriction was held to be in public interest and as bearing a reasonable nexus to the objects sought to be achieved, viz., to reduce shortage of sugar and ensure its equitable distribution. The restriction was not more excessive than what the situation demanded. A law prohibiting advertisements relating to magic remedies was held valid because the underlying purpose of the law was to prevent objectionable and unethical advertisements in order to discourage self-medication and self-treatment.19 Whether a particular restriction on trade (prohibiting selling of eggs) to the extent of its complete prohibition is to be considered reasonable within the meaning of clause (b) depends on the nature of trade involved and the public interest to be subserved by such total prohibition. In this respect the Supreme Court has held that the term reasonable restriction as appearing in clause (6) is highly flexible and draws colour from its context. In this case the Court come to the reasoning that a large number of residents are strict vegetarians. A major source of employment and revenue in Rishikesh, Haridwar and Muni Ki Reti is derived from tourism and a floating population of pilgrims. On the other hand as the appellant/petitioners who are running hotels and restaurants form a small section of the population who can also trade in adjoining towns and villages no substantial harm is caused to them.20 A law setting up markets for commercial crops and prohibiting any trade in such crops within a reasonable radius of a market has been held to be reasonable. The purpose is to reduce scope for exploitation in dealings. Such markets ensure correct weighing and reasonable prices and provide other facilities to the growers of commercial crops.21 Qualitative restrictions imposed on fruit products through a legal provision have been held valid as being reasonable and in public interest.22 In Minerva Talkies, Bangalore v. State of Karnataka, 23 the Supreme Court has upheld a rule made by the State Government to the effect that no licensee shall exhibit more than four cinema shows in a day. The Court has ruled that the rule in question does not impose any unreasonable restriction on the freedom to carry on any occupation, trade or business guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(g) in the interest of general public. The state law prohibited members of the State Medical Education Service from private practice. The Supreme Court held the restriction to be reasonable and hence valid.24 The Court said that no one compels any one to join the service; one is free to leave it at anytime. The restriction is not on the freedom to practise the medical profession but on such practice while one continues to be a member of the state service. The restriction is in public interest. The state is free to recruit persons to its services on such terms as it thinks desirable to make the services beneficial to the public. (d) STREET HAWKERS In Bombay Hawkers' Union v. Bombay Municipal Corporation, 25 the Supreme Court ruled, in answer to the claim of the hawkers that under Art. 19(1)(g) they have a Fundamental Right to carry on their trade on public streets, that no one has a right to do business so as to cause annoyance or inconvenience to members of the public. Public streets are meant for use by the general public; they are not meant to facilitate the carrying on of private trade or business. But the hawkers ought not to be completely deprived of their right to carry on trade. So, the Court directed that there should be hawking zones in the city where licenses should not be refused to the hawkers except for good reasons. In Sodan Singh v. New Delhi Municipality, 26 (I) the Supreme Court again considered the question: how far the hawkers have a right to ply their trade on pavements meant for pedestrians? In the instant case, the Court has come to the conclusion that the right to carry on trade or business mentioned in Art. 19(1)(g) on street pavements, if properly regulated, cannot be denied on the ground that the street pavements are meant Page 1182 exclusively for pedestrians and cannot be put to any other use. Proper regulation is, however, a necessary condition, for otherwise the very object of laying roads would be defeated.",

Proper regulation is, however, a necessary condition, for otherwise the very object of laying roads would be defeated. The State holds all public roads and streets in the country as a trustee on behalf of the public and the members of the public are entitled as beneficiaries to use them for trading as a matter of right subject to the right of others including pedestrians. The right of hawkers is subject to reasonable restrictions under Art. 19(6). The Court has however negatived the contention of the hawkers that they have a Fundamental Right to occupy a particular place on the pavement where they can squat and do business. \"The petitioners do have a Fundamental Right to carry on a trade or business of their choice but not do so at a particular place,27\" said the Court. The Court has conceded to the hawkers the right to do business while going from place to place subject to proper regulation in the interest of general convenience of the public. The Sodan ruling has been reiterated by the Court in Sodan Singh v. NDMC (II) .28 The Court has said that every citizen has a right to the use of a public street vested in the state as a beneficiary but this right is subject to reasonable restrictions as the state may choose to impose. \"Street trading is albeit a Fundamental Right under Art. 19(1)(g) of the Constitution but it is subject to reasonable restrictions which the state may choose to impose by virtue of Art. 19(6).\" This right includes hawking on the street pavements by moving from one place to another without being stationary on any part of the pavement. This does not include a citizen occupying or squatting on any specific place of his choice on the pavement, regardless of the rights of others, including the pedestrians, to use the pavements. The Court has emphasized in this connection: \"Proper regulation is, however a necessary condition, for otherwise the very object of laying roads would be defeated.\"29 The right to hawk cannot be unreasonably restricted The correct approach is to determine where hawking is not to be permitted and thereafter such areas to be non-hawking zones.30 In a matter relating to eviction of illegal squatters occupying railway property and also areas around Rabindra Sarobar, the Calcutta High Court directed the railway administration and the State of West Bengal to provide sanitary facilities to the squatters as interim measure. The Union of India went to Supreme Court contending that the High Court ought to have directed police assistance for eviction and rather than providing them with further benefit as such occupation was causing danger to passengers and goods carried by railway and also causing pollution. The Supreme Court directed that the High Court should take necessary steps to give effect to the orders of eviction passed by competent authorities and also the High Court from time to time.31 It is clear that in these cases the Supreme Court has sought to reconcile the interests of the pedestrians with those of the hawkers.32 (e) WAGES, GRATUITY, LABOUR DISPUTES There is a close relationship between the right to carry on trade and wages payable to the employees in a trade or industry. Too high wages may affect the economic viability of an industry; but too low wages may amount to exploitation of human labour. A balance has to be drawn between the two conflicting values and the Supreme Court has sought to do so in several cases. The Court has held that the technique of appointing a wage board consisting equally of the representatives of the employers and employees with a few neutral members and a neutral chairman for fixing wages in an industry according to factors laid down and according to natural justice, does not amount to an unreasonable restriction on trade and commerce.33 Wages are usually classified into 'living wage', 'fair wage' and 'minimum wage'. A 'minimum wage' provides for bare sustenance of life just sufficient to cover the bare physical needs of a worker and his family and such a wage must be paid to a worker irrespective of the industry's capacity to pay. 'A living wage' provides a frugal measure of comfort and other amenities, e.g., education and health in addition to what 'minimum wage' provides for. A 'fair wage' is a mean between 'minimum' and 'living' wages. Arts. 19(1)(g) and 19(6) demand that in fixing 'living' or 'fair' wages, industry's capacity to pay is an essential ingredient. Fixing 'living' or 'fair' wages without taking into consideration 'capacity to pay' amounts to an unreasonable restraint on the right to carry on trade.34 Page 1183 Gratuity, the Supreme Court has held, is a retirement benefit which may be awarded by an employer when an employee retires or resigns from service voluntarily after completion of 15 years' continuous service. Gratuity being a reward for good, efficient and faithful service rendered for a considerable period, there could be no justification for awarding it when an employee resigns only after three years' service except under exceptional circumstances. Accordingly, a provision of law providing for gratuity in such a case amounts to an unreasonable restriction under Art. 19(6) on the employer's right to carry on business and would be liable to be struck down as unconstitutional.35 In British Paints,36 the Supreme Court accepted 10 years' minimum period of service for earning gratuity. In Straw Board,37 the Court again changed its position and upheld the 5 years' minimum qualifying period of service for entitlement to gratuity to workmen who voluntarily retire or resign. This shows that the concept of \"gratuity\" has undergone a metamorphosis over time.",

    "content": "Straw Board,37 the Court again changed its position and upheld the 5 years' minimum qualifying period of service for entitlement to gratuity to workmen who voluntarily retire or resign. This shows that the concept of \"gratuity\" has undergone a metamorphosis over time. The obligation of the employer to pay gratuity to the employee on his resignation or retirement after a continuous service of five years has been held to be a reasonable restriction in public interest on the employer's right to carry on trade. The Court has justified it as a welfare measure in the interest of the general public to secure social and economic justice to workmen to assist them in their old age and to ensure them a decent standard of life on their retirement.38 Provisions made for labour-welfare providing for annual paid leave or one month's notice for dismissal have been held to be reasonable.39 In Jalan Trading Co. v. D.M. Aney, 40 a statutory obligation to pay the statutory minimum bonus by the employers to the employees even when the employer sustained loss has been held to be reasonable and in public interest, as this is in implementation of the Directive Principles in Arts. 39 and 43.41 What is sanctioned by the Directive Principles cannot be regarded as unreasonable or contrary to public interest in the context of Art. 19.42 A state law increasing the number of compulsory paid national and paid holidays from 9 to 13 during a year has been held to be valid in view of Art. 43.43 (f) ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES Trades in certain commodities (designated as essential commodities) may be more drastically regulated than trade in other commodities. To assess the reasonableness of a restriction, the nature of the business and conditions prevailing therein are important factors to be considered. As these factors differ from trade to trade, no hard and fast rules concerning all trades can be laid down. The result of this approach is that Courts may hold drastic restrictions on certain trades in certain circumstances as reasonable. As for example, fixation of a ceiling of 200 quintals on wheat stocks possessed by a dealer at any time is valid to obviate black-marketing and hoarding in essential commodities.44 A similar embargo on sugar stocks has been held valid.45 A notification under the Essential Commodities Act imposed a levy on sugar manufacturers. They were required to hand over to the government 50 per cent of their production at a fixed price. They could sell the rest in free market. The notification was challenged on the ground that the price of levy sugar was not sufficient to cover their manufacturing cost. The Court rejected the argument on the following grounds: (1) Interest of the consumers must prevail over that of manufacturers. The dominant object of the price control policy was to ensure equitable distribution and make the commodity available at fair price so as to benefit the consumers. Thus, individual interests must yield to the larger interests of the community. (2) Even if the petitioners had to bear some loss, that would not make the restriction unreasonable.46 The determining factor was the interest of the consumer and not that of the producer. (3) Since the petitioners could sell 50 per cent of their production in the open market, the loss to them, if any, would be minimal.47 An order establishing direct relation, in the field of copper trade, between the importer and the consumer of copper, and completely eliminating the middleman--the dealer, was held valid in Narendra Kumar.48 Copper is an essential commodity; its indigenous production is small; consumers depend on imported copper and there is a tendency of its price to go up. The order was promulgated in an honest effort to protect the interests of the general public. A rule banning all hedging contracts in cotton except those permitted by the Textile Commissioner, and also Page 1184 authorising him to place such restrictions as he thought fit on such contracts, was held valid. Cotton being an essential commodity, restrictions may reasonably amount to prohibition for a time of all normal trading in the commodity.49 Drastic restrictions placed on the dealers of gold by the Gold (Control) Act have been upheld.50 (g) SLAUGHTER OF ANIMALS To reconcile the right of butchers to carry on their trade, and restrictions imposed on killing of animals through several State laws, the Supreme Court has adopted an economic approach, viz., killing of useful animals could be prohibited but not of those animals who have become economically useless to the society. The Court has emphasized that a prohibition imposed on the Fundamental Right to carry on trade and commerce cannot be regarded as reasonable if it is imposed not in the interest of general public, but merely to respect the susceptibilities and sentiments of a section of the people. Thus, it is reasonable to prohibit slaughter of cows of all ages and male or female calves of cows or buffaloes; prohibition of slaughter of bulls, bullocks and she-buffaloes below the age of twenty-five years is an unreasonable restriction on the butchers' right to carry on their trade as well as not in public interest as these animals cease to be useful after the age of 15 years.51 The Court observed in this connection in Quareshi: \"The maintenance of useless cattle involves a wasteful drain on the nation's cattle feed. To maintain them is to deprive the useful cattle of the much needed nourishment. The presence of so many useless animals tends to deteriorate the breed.\" An elaborate procedure for certification of animals for slaughter has also been held unreasonable as imposing disproportionate restriction on the butchers' right to carry on their trade.52 A municipal corporation issued a standing order under a statute directing closure of slaughter houses for seven holidays in a year. The order was challenged as putting an unreasonable restriction on the trade of the butchers.",

    "content": "presence of so many useless animals tends to deteriorate the breed.\" An elaborate procedure for certification of animals for slaughter has also been held unreasonable as imposing disproportionate restriction on the butchers' right to carry on their trade.52 A municipal corporation issued a standing order under a statute directing closure of slaughter houses for seven holidays in a year. The order was challenged as putting an unreasonable restriction on the trade of the butchers. The question before the Court was whether the restriction was reasonable in the interest of the general public. The question before the Court was whether the restriction was reasonable in the interest of the general public. The Supreme Court took the view that the expression \"in the interest of general public\" found in Art. 19(6) \"is of wide import comprehending public order, public health, public security, morals, economic welfare of the community and the objects mentioned in the Directive Principles.\" The Court ruled that the order in question did not put any unreasonable restrictions on the Fundamental Right of the petitioners under Art. 19(1)(g).53 A ban was put on the slaughter of bulls and bullocks below the age of 16 years. The Supreme Court found that these animals could be used for breeding, draught and agricultural purposes up to the age of 16 years. Accordingly, the Court ruled that the restriction was not unreasonable, looking to the balance which needs to be struck between public interest, which requires preservation of useful animals, and permitting the different traders in beef, etc. to carry on their trade and profession.54 Again, the State of Madhya Pradesh imposed a total ban on the slaughter of bulls and, bullocks and again, the Supreme Court quashed the same.55 After referring to all the provisions cases on this question, the Court stuck to its view that these animals were useful only up to the age of 16 years and their slaughter thereafter could not be banned. Referring to Art. 48, a Directive Principle,56 the Court observed that absolute ban on slaughter of bulls and bullocks is not necessary to comply with Art. 48. The Court has thus sought to strike a balance between the right of the butchers to carry on their trade and public interest. (h) IMPORT AND EXPORT Drastic restrictions on the right of trade and commerce have been judicially upheld for the purpose of import and export control. The reason is that import and export policy of a country has to be flexible in modern times as it needs constant adjustments keeping in view the needs of the country, international relations, foreign exchange position, need to protect indigenous industries and a number of other relevant factors. No one can claim an unrestricted right to import or export. The import and export policy forms an integral part of the country's economic policy.57 Thus, the system of licensing of imports and exports has been held to be reasonable. To regulate imports and exports, there is first the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, 1947, which Page 1185 is a short enactment of eight sections. Issued thereunder are the two orders, the Import Control Order and the Export Control Order. Then, at the third stage, there is the import and export policy announced by the Central Government from time to time. The policy statement is not statutory but only administrative. The Supreme Court has accepted the right of the Central Government to change, rescind or alter the policy from time to time merely by administrative instructions. Courts do not normally go into such policy decisions. It has also been held that no person can claim a right to the grant of an import or export licence, enforceable at law, merely on the basis of a policy statement.58 Then, with a view to earn foreign exchange, if under the Import or Export Order, the Government decides to canalise import or export of a commodity through a specialised channel, import or export licences in that commodity could be refused to individuals. Such canalisation is not per se an unreasonable restriction and it would be presumed to be in public interest unless the contrary is shown clearly.59 For example, in Glass Chatons,60 the import of glass chatons was banned, but import licences were issued to the State Trading Corporation under the import order. This is an example where by administrative policy-making, and by using its power to issue import or export licences, the government was able to create a monopoly for import and export of several commodities in favour of its specialized agencies like the State Trading Corporation, the Mineral and Metal Trade Corporation, etc. To earn foreign exchange, Parliament enacted a law to impose an obligation on sugar mills to hand over a percentage of their production to a government agency for export. The export price realised was less than the government fixed internal price. The scheme was challenged on the ground that the mills were being forced to sell a part of their production at a loss. The government's contention however was that in fixing the internal price, it had added a margin to cover the loss on export. The Supreme Courtupheld the scheme as reasonable because the loss, if any, was comparatively less and there was a very real possibility of its being recouped. The Court also ruled that reasonableness of a restriction imposed under one Act could be assessed by taking into account the countervailing advantage conferred under another Act if both the Acts are enacted as part of a single legislative plan.61 (i) TAXING LAWS At times, taxing statutes have been challenged under Art. 19(1)(g), but it is rarely that such a challenge succeeds.62 A taxing statute is not per se regarded as a restriction on the freedom under Art. 19(1)(g) even if it imposes some hardship in individual cases.",

    "content": "but it is rarely that such a challenge succeeds.62 A taxing statute is not per se regarded as a restriction on the freedom under Art. 19(1)(g) even if it imposes some hardship in individual cases. \"Then again, the mere excessiveness of a tax or even the circumstance that its imposition might tend towards the diminution of the earnings or profits of the persons of incidence does not per se, and without more, constitute violation of the rights under Art. 19(1)(g).\"63 Accordingly, the Supreme Court upheld a tax on \"chargeable expenditure\" in a hotel having room rent of Rs. 400 or more per day.64 Sales tax is a tax on the sale of goods. Unless confiscatory, such a tax does not impose an unreasonable restriction on the right of a person to carry on trade whether or not law permits or prohibits the dealers from passing on tax to the purchasers.65 Imposition of a tax with retrospective effect is not ordinarily regarded as invalid. To test whether a retrospective imposition of a tax operates so harshly as to violate the Fundamental Right under Art. 19(1)(g), the Court considers such factors as relevant as the context in which retroactivity was contemplated, such as, whether the law is one of validation of a taxing statute struck down by the Courts for certain defects, the period of such retroactivity, and the degree and extent of any unforeseen or unforeseeable financial burden for the past period, etc. A sales tax law voided by the High Court was validated by the State Legislature with retrospective effect by passing an Act. This retrospective law was held valid. Had the law not been validated, dealers who had already collected the tax from customers would have had a windfall as they would not have had any such right had the original law been held valid.66 A competent legislature can always validate a law declared invalid by the Courts provided the infirmities and vitiating factors noticed by the Court are in its judgment, are removed or cured by the legislature. Such a validating law can be made retrospective.67 The Courts do not usually interfere with a tax on the ground of its being excessive, or that it imposes a heavy burden on trade and commerce, or that the profits of the business are greatly reduced thereby.68 Except in the extreme case when the Court regards an impost as confiscatory,69 or discriminatory.70 Page 1186 An impost on trade, whether a licence-fee or a tax, levied through an invalid or unconstitutional law, infringes Art. 19(1)(g) for an illegal impost always amounts to an unreasonable restriction on a citizen's right.71 A tax which is 'compensatory' in nature can never operate as an unreasonable restriction on the right to carry on trade or business. The very idea underlying such a tax is service more or less commensurate with the tax levied, and no citizen can claim a right to engage in trade without paying for the special services he receives from the state. This is part of the cost of carrying on business.72 (j) INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES The scale of compensation payable to the employees by the employers who close their undertakings, prescribed by the Industrial Disputes Act, has been held to be not unreasonable,73 because it is based on social justice.74 In Fertilizer Corporation Kamagar Union v. Union of India, 75 the workers in the Public undertaking challenged the validity of sale of certain plants and equipment claiming that this would result in the retrenchment of many workers and, thus, depriving them of their right under Art. 19(1)(g). The Court rejected the challenge saying that Art. 19(1)(g) does not protect the right to work in a particular post under a contract of employment. \"The right to pursue a calling or to carry on an occupation is not the same thing as the right to work in any particular post under a contract of employment.\" Art. 19(1)(g) cannot be invoked against the loss of a job or retrenchment or removal from service. If workers are retrenched in a factory, they can pursue their rights and remedies under the industrial laws. The closure of an establishment in which a workman is for the time being employed does not by itself infringe his Fundamental Right under Art. 19(1)(g). \" Art. 19(1)(g) confers a broad and general right which is available to all persons to do work of any particular kind and of their choice. It does not confer the right to hold a particular job or to occupy a particular post of one's choice.\" (k) ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATION An administrative order not authorised by law under which it is made, and imposing a restriction on the right to carry on business, is void under Art. 19(1)(g).76Thus, a condition imposed on the licensee by the licensing authority which is not justified by the Act and the rules under which the licence is issued and which also seriously affects the business of the licensee, would be unreasonable.77 An order made under a law should impose reasonable restrictions on trade and commerce. Thus, fixing a period of 26 days for disposal of sugar released for free sale in the open market was held unreasonable. Further, refusal by government to extend the period when the petitioners had done every thing they could to remove the sugar from their godowns was also held to be unreasonable as the government acted mechanically in the matter.78 The area of trade, commerce and business is progressively coming under rigorous administrative regulation.",

    "content": "price-fixing, requisitioning of stocks, control on movement of commodities, regulation of industry have been undertaken in the country on a large scale; because of several reasons, e.g., shortage and scarcity of essential commodities, need for economic regeneration of the country under the impact of the five year plans, to discourage some immoral and illegal trades and unfair trade practices, the present day concept of socialist pattern of society, and to reduce concentration of wealth in a few hands.79 The general principle is that the power conferred on the executive by a law to regulate trade or commerce should not be arbitrary, \"unregulated by any rule or principle\". A law or order which confers arbitrary power upon the executive in the matter of regulating trade or business is regarded unreasonable.80 Generally speaking, administrative discretion is not regarded as arbitrary if the circumstances in, or the grounds on, which it can be exercised are stated, or if the law lays down the policy to achieve which the discretion is to be exercised, or if there are enough procedural safeguards in the law to provide security against misuse of the discretion. In case of trades which are illegal, dangerous, immoral or injurious to the health, morality and welfare of the public, a greater discretionary power may be left with the Executive than is permissible in case of normal trades. The practical operation of these norms can be illustrated with reference to some judicial pronouncements. Page 1187 A lot of discretionary power is conferred on the Central/State Governments under several labour laws to regulate labour-management relationship. Several cases have arisen based on these discretionary powers. In Bijay Cotton Mills v. Ajmer, 81the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, was challenged on the ground that it put unreasonable restrictions on employers (who could not carry on their trade without paying minimum wages), the employees (who could not work on terms mutually agreed upon between them and their employers), and that the procedure to fix minimum wages was arbitrary as it left everything to the unfettered discretion of the government. TheSupreme Courtheld the Act valid. Securing of living wages to labourers is in public interest for it is necessary to ensure not only bare physical subsistence but also health and decency to labourers. It is necessary to curb the freedom of contract to prevent the exploitation of labour. Though the powers enjoyed by the government are wide, yet there are sufficient procedural safeguards, viz., the government is to take into consideration, before fixing the minimum wages, advice of the committee or representations of the people so affected; consultation with advisory bodies is obligatory for revision of minimum wages; there is a Central Advisory Board to advise the Central and State Governments in the matter of fixing and revision of minimum wages and to act as a co-ordinating agency for different advisory bodies: each committee or advisory body is to consist of an equal number of representatives of employers and employees with a few independent persons who could take a fair and impartial view of the matter. There is no provision for review of the government decision, but that does not make the Act unreasonable as it has adequate safeguards against hasty or capricious decision by the government. A provision in the Industrial Disputes Act [ S. 25-O] requires an employer intending to close down his industrial undertaking to give a three months' notice to the government of his intended closure. The government could refuse to permit closure if it was satisfied that the reasons for the intended closure of the undertaking were \"not adequate and sufficient\" or that \"such closure is prejudicial to the public interest\". If an employer closed down the undertaking without observing this procedure, he could be punished with imprisonment up to 6 months, or fine up to 500 rupees or with both. The closure would be illegal and the workmen would be entitled to all the benefits under any law as if no notice had been given to them. In Excel Wear v. Union of India, 82 the Supreme Court declared this provision to be unconstitutional. Commenting on the above provision, the Court said that the reasons given by the employer for closure of the undertaking might be correct yet permission could still be refused if the government thought them to be \"not adequate and sufficient\". No provision has been made for review of the order, or for appeal from it. No reasons need be given in the government order granting or refusing the permission. So, the order could be whimsical and capricious. Government is enjoined to pass the order within the 90 days' period. The right to close down a business is \"an integral part\" of the right to carry it on.83 The Court rejected the contention that \"an employer has no right to close down a business once he starts it.\" The right to close is itself a Fundamental Right embedded in the right to carry on any business guaranteed under Art. 19(1)(g). But as no right is absolute in scope, this right could also be restricted, regulated or controlled by law in the interest of the general public. The restrictions imposed on this right by the impugned provision in question were held to be unreasonable as there was no higher body to scrutinize the government order negativing employer's request to close down. The Court also rejected the contention of the employers that the right to close down business was at par with the right not to start a business at all. The Court said that while no one can be compelled to start a business, it is different from closing down a business. The two rights cannot be equated. Thereafter, S. 25-N was enacted. This provision says that an employer cannot retrench any worker who has been in service for a year without the consent of the government. If the government fails to communicate its decision within two months, the permission shall be deemed to have been granted.",

This provision says that an employer cannot retrench any worker who has been in service for a year without the consent of the government. If the government fails to communicate its decision within two months, the permission shall be deemed to have been granted. In Meenakshi Mills,84 the Supreme Court has held that S. 25-N constitutes a reasonable restriction on the employer's right to carry on trade. The discretion of the government is not absolute but subject to proper procedural safeguards. For example, the government is to make an inquiry according to natural justice before coming to a decision; the government is to record reasons for its decision and it has to decide the matter within a time frame of 10 days and, thus, cannot unduly delay matters. In course of time, S. 25-O was amended the vices pointed out therein in Excel Wear were sought to be Page 1188 removed. The constitutional validity of the amended S. 25-O came to be considered by the Supreme Court in the undernoted case.85 Under the amended section, the government order granting or refusing permission must be in writing and be a reasoned order. The government order was to be passed after giving a reasonable opportunity of being heard to the employer, the workmen and any one else interested in the closure. A review tribunal had also been established the government must pass its order in 60 days failing which the permission would be deemed to have been granted. In the circumstances, the Court upheld the validity of the amended provision. A similar provision, S. 25-M of the Industrial Disputes Act, requiring government's prior permission to lay off any worker has been held to be valid inPapnasam.86S. 25-M contains all the procedural safeguards to be found in S. 25-N. (l) LICENSING Regulation of trade through a licensing system is the order of the day,87 In a number of cases, Courts have considered the permissible scope of the licensing power of the Administration with reference to Arts. 19(1)(g) and 19(6). It is now clearly settled that a system of licensing of a trade is not unreasonable provided that the licensing officers are not left with uncontrolled power to grant, revoke or cancel a licence. There should be reasonable norms, policy or principles to guide administrative power as well as some procedural safeguards. The Supreme Court has stated on this point in the following case:88 \"Where, however, power is entrusted to an administrative agency to grant or withhold a permit or licence in its uncontrolled discretion the law ex facie infringes the Fundamental Right under Art. 19(1)(g).\" In Seshadri v. Dist. Magistrate, 89 a rule requiring a cinema licensee to show at each performance approved film of such length and for such length of time as the government might direct has been held to be unreasonable because the government is vested with an unregulated discretion to compel an exhibitor to show a film of any length and there is no principle to guide the government in this matter. Similarly, prescribing a minimum length of film to be shown at a performance without fixing a maximum, is also unreasonable for this confers an unfettered discretion on the government to interfere with the cinema licensee's right to carry on trade. No principle is laid down to guide the government. A condition couched in such wide language is bound to operate harshly upon the cinema business and, thus, cannot be regarded as a reasonable restriction. A provision conferring wide power to grant or cancel a licence on an administrator, without mentioning the grounds on which he could exercise his power was held unreasonable in Dwarka Pd. v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 90 as the matter was left to the unrestrained will of a single individual. The only safeguard against improper exercise of power was that the licensing officer would record reasons for the action taken by him. This was not regarded as an effective safeguard as there was no higher authority to examine the propriety of these reasons, and revise or review his decision, and the reasons recorded by him were thus only for his own subjective satisfaction and not for furnishing any remedy to the aggrieved person. To the same effect is the case noted below.91 A regulation imposed a licensing system for non-tribal orders. If the licence was refused, the reasons for refusal had to be recorded. The Supreme Courtquashed the regulation as it did not provide any principles or standards on which the licensing authority was to act. \"There being no principles or standards laid down in the Regulation there are obviously no restraints or limits within which the power of the Executive Committee to refuse to grant or renew a licence is to be exercised\". There was no provision for appeal against the decision of the authority refusing to grant the licence. On the other hand, where law gave guidance to the licensing authority in the matter of issuing licences, obligated it to record reasons in case licence was refused, and provided for appeals and revision against his decisions, it was held reasonable.92 The provision in the Gold Control Act for licensing of dealers of gold ornaments was held invalid inHarakchand v. Union of India, 93 because it conferred unguided power on the executive. The administrator in granting licences was to have regard to such factors as 'suitability of the applicant', 'anticipated demand as Page 1189 estimated by him for ornaments in the region' and 'public interest'. The Supreme Court held that these terms were vague, not capable of objective assessment, provided no objective norm to guide the administrator's discretion and, thus, unfettered power had been given to him to grant or refuse a licence.",

    "content": "Supreme Court held that these terms were vague, not capable of objective assessment, provided no objective norm to guide the administrator's discretion and, thus, unfettered power had been given to him to grant or refuse a licence. The Court also held it unreasonable to prescribe the same conditions for renewal as for initial grant of licence as that rendered the entire future of business uncertain and subject to arbitrary administrative will. A Tamil Nadu Act introduced a system of licensing of private educational institutions. The relevant statutory provision merely said that the State Government \"may grant or refuse to grant permission\". The only procedural safeguard laid down was that the permission would not be refused \"unless the applicant has been given an opportunity of making his representa-tion\". Thus, the licensing authority could grant or refuse to grant a license but he could not refuse without giving to the applicant an opportunity to make a representation. The Supreme Court held the provision unconstitutional under Art. 19(1)(g) in Parasuraman.94 There was no criteria laid down for the government to adopt in exercising its licensing power. \"The result is that the power to grant or refuse permission is to be exercised according to the whims of the authority and it may differ from person to person holding the office.\" The government was left with \"unrestricted and unguided discretion\" which rendered the provision \"unfair and discriminatory\" vis-a-vis Art. 19(1)(g). The power to cancel a license on contravention of any direction issued by the competent authority was held to suffer from the vice of arbitrariness. The criteria laid down in the Railway Tourist Agent Rules for recognition of a person as an authorised railway tourist agent have been held to be not irrelevant or arbitrary.95A rule in the Motor Vehicles Rules laying down a scheme for the evaluation of the merits of various applicants for a stage carriage permit, and giving preference to new entrants for short routes, has been held valid under Art. 19(1)(g) as it is salutary and avoids monopoly.96 A provision giving preference to an application from state transport undertaking for operating in any interstate route has been held valid.97 In a scheme for distribution of foodstuffs through fair price shops run by government, giving preference to co-operative societies is not violative of Art. 19(1)(g).1 Co-operative societies play positive and progressive role in country's economy and, most surely, in the fair and effective distribution of foodstuffs. The Customs House Agents Licensing Rules, 1960, restricted the number of such licences to be issued. This was held valid for \"a profession or trade has sometimes to be limited in the public interest\", e.g., porters at a railway station, taxi cabs, etc. A rule vesting authority in the customs collector to reject an application for licence if the applicant was not considered \"suitable\" was held invalid as it vested discretion in the collector to reject a candidate for 'trumpery reasons'. The collector was not required to state his reasons for rejecting an application. The rule authorising the collector to cancel a licence for failure to comply with the rules was held valid as rules were made for compliance and not for breach, and there was the safeguard of an appeal to a higher authority.2 A provision in the Calcutta Municipal Act required a licence for use of premises for a purpose which in the opinion of the corporation was dangerous to life, health or property. The opinion of the corporation was made conclusive as it could not be challenged in a Court. The provision was declared to be unreasonable under Art. 19(6) as it put carrying on of a business entirely at the mercy of the corporation.3 Similarly, a rule conferring an uncontrolled power to cancel a licence, without stipulating that reasons be given and some procedure be followed by the licensing authority for the purpose, is not reasonable.4 A provision providing for cancellation of licence for specified causes, and after giving reasonable opportunity of hearing to the licensee, is valid.5 Even under a valid provision, an administrative order cancelling the licence will be quashed if it does not fulfil the condition laid down, or if the concerned administrative officer is biased against the licensee, or if a reasonable opportunity of hearing is not given. The function of cancelling a licence has been characterised as quasi-judicial and, therefore, rules of natural justice must be followed.6 The Bihar Mica Act, 1948, introduced a licensing system to regulate trading in mica in the State.S. 25 authorised the State Government to cancel the license on the grounds stated therein. Before cancelling a Page 1190 license, it was necessary to furnish the grounds to the licensee and afford him a reasonable opportunity to show cause against cancellation. The Supreme Court in Mineral Development Ltd. v. State of Bihar7 held the provisions reasonable. The discretion to cancel the licence was vested in the highest executive authority in the State which ordinarily could be relied upon to discharge the duties honestly and in public interest. The provision provided clearly ascertainable standards for the State Government to apply to the facts of each case and due procedural safeguards had been provided to the licensee. Video games being games of chance and not of skill, broad discretion may be conferred on the licensing authority to regulate such games. However, a restriction imposed must not be arbitrary. Action of the concerned authority must be informed by reason. An action uninformed by reason may be regarded as arbitrary. The action of the concerned authority must be founded upon relevant grounds of public interest.8 S. 4(1)of the Chit Funds Act, 1982, says that no chit is to be commenced without the previous sanction of the State Government.S. 4(3) gives guidance to the State Government for granting and/or refusing to grant previous sanction. The Supreme Court held the provisions to be regulatory in nature and not violative of Art.",

The Supreme Court held the provisions to be regulatory in nature and not violative of Art. 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.9 Ordinarily a licence may be suspended (pending inquiry for cancellation) without giving any hearing to the licensee, for suspension is a preliminary stage and inquiry must be held before cancellation.10 S. 8B of the Imports Control Order empowers the Central Government or the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports to keep in abeyance applications for licences or allotment of imported goods for 6 months in public interest where any investigation is pending into any allegation against a licensee or importer. No reasons need be given. The Supreme Court has ruled in Liberty Oil Mills v. Union of India11 that such an order cannot be made without due investigation and without giving a reasonable opportunity to the affected party. \"Procedural fairness embodying natural justice is to be implied whenever action is taken affecting the rights of parties.\" The abeyance order must be communicated to the concerned person. Reasons must exist for the decision since \"the decision may only be taken if the authority is satisfied that the grant of the licence or allotment of imported goods will not be in the public interest.\" An outline of the allegations must be given to provide an opportunity to the person affected to make representation. In this case, however, the opportunity of hearing had to be post-decisional. The trade of money lending was sought to be regulated through a licensing system. The power given to the licensing officer to forfeit security furnished by a licensee on contravention of the licence terms was held to be unreasonable as there were many other adequate provisions for ensuring compliance with the conditions of the licence.12 (m) MOVEMENT OF GOODS Clause 3 of the Cotton Textiles (Control of Movement) Order, 1948, provided that no person should transport by rail, road, sea or inland navigation any cloth or yarn except under a permit issued by the Textile Commissioner. The restriction was held valid for to leave transport of essential commodities uncontrolled would seriously hamper the supply of such commodities to the public. The Textile Commissioner did not have an unregulated and arbitrary power to refuse or grant a permit, because the discretion given to him was to be exercised so as to effectuate the policy underlying the order, viz., to regulate the import of cotton textiles so as to ensure its even distribution in the country and make it available at a fair price to all. The conferment of such discretion could not be regarded as invalid.13 A perusal of the Court's opinion leaves the impression that the Court has taken a more relaxed view with respect to movement permits than trading licences. The reason for this may be that whereas without a licence a person could not at all carry on his trade, a restriction on movement affects only one aspect of the total trade leaving the rest free. Therefore, Courts insist on better safeguards in case of administrative discretion relating to trading licences than in the case of issue of movement permits.14 (n) REQUISITIONING OF STOCKS Page 1191 The Rajasthan Foodgrains Control Order authorised administrative authority to freeze any stocks of foodgrains held by a person and also to requisition and dispose of such stocks at the government procurement price. Objection was taken to it on the ground that an absolute discretion had been conferred on the administrative authority. The Court, however, observed that though the specific rule in question did not mention the grounds on which stocks could be frozen, yet the parent Act, viz., the Essential Supplies Act, 1946, did lay down the policy, and the freezing of stocks was reasonably related to that object, and so the clause was valid. The power to requisition stocks at a rate fixed by it and dispose of such stocks at any rate in its discretion vested an unrestrained authority to requisition stocks of foodgrains at an arbitrary price and so was invalid.15 (o) PRICE FIXING A regulatory power over trade and commerce, of great significance in modern times, conceded to the Administration under several legal provisions, is that of price-fixing of commodities. A balance has to be drawn here between the interests of the manufacturers as well as of the consumers. The Courts have in several cases considered the question of scope of such a power and subject to what safeguards it should be conferred on the Administration. The basic norm in this case, as in other cases, is that unlimited discretion to fix prices should not be conferred on administrative authorities. In the earlier cases, the Supreme Court appeared to insist that the relevant law should lay down the considerations which the price-fixing authority must keep in mind while fixing prices. Thus, in Dwarka Prasad,16 the very first case on price-fixing, the statutory formula for fixing prices mentioned 8 items, of these, six were fixed but two left some marginal discretion to the executive. The formula was held to be good, the Court stating that \"arbitrary power unregulated by any rule or principle\" was bad, and that discretion should not be absolute. But, in later cases, the rigours of this judicial stand have been very much diluted. Clause 11B of the Iron and Steel Order, 1941, issued by the Central Government, authorised the Iron Controller to fix maximum prices to sell iron. Such prices could differ for iron and steel obtainable from different sources, and could include allowances for contribution to, and payment from, an equalisation fund established by the Controller.",

    "content": "prices could differ for iron and steel obtainable from different sources, and could include allowances for contribution to, and payment from, an equalisation fund established by the Controller. No more guidance was given to the Controller in the matter of fixing prices, yet the Order was held valid on the ground that since the parent Act, the Essential Supplies Act, laid down the policy, the Order could not be regarded as conferring uncontrolled power on the Controller to fix prices.17 This judicial approach does not appear to be satisfactory. The parent Act [The Essential Commodities Act, 1955] applies not only to iron and steel but to a number of commodities, and not only to price-fixing but to regulation of all aspects of trade in essential commodities. Therefore, the policy laid down in the Act is in very general terms, and is hardly of much efficacy to control administrative discretion. The necessary elements going into price-fixing are bound to vary from commodity to commodity, and one general formula applicable to all commodities can hardly be adequate. It is, therefore, necessary that specific considerations applicable to price-fixing of individual commodities be laid down separately. It is only when this is done that Courts can evaluate whether or not relevant considerations have been followed by the administration in fixing the price of the concerned commodity. An order authorised the controller to fix the price of ice. Four factors were stated in the order which the controller had to take in view while fixing the price. The High Court upheld the formula saying that it gave enough, clear and effective guidelines to the controller to fix prices, and it excluded any chance of capricious or arbitrary fixation of price for the manufacturers.18 The Courts do not insist on any procedural safeguards in this area.19 Price-fixing is regarded more in the nature of a legislative power than an administrative power and, consequently, the rules of natural justice are not required to be followed.20 The Supreme Court once emphasized that the price fixed should be fair and not arbitrary; that it should not be below the cost of production: that the price should not be fixed on extraneous considerations; and if the price is fixed in such a manner that the producer is enabled to recover his cost of production and secure a reasonable margin of profit, no aspect of Fundamental Right under Art. 19(1)(g) is infringed.21 Page 1192 In spite of this norm, except in one case, viz., Premier Automobiles,22 the Supreme Court has not interfered with any price-fixing order. In the Iron price case,23 the Court said that in considering the validity of a price fixed, it was not enough to show that a particular stock-holder suffered loss in respect of particular transactions. What was to be proved was the general effect of the price in question on all classes of dealers taken as a whole. If it were shown that in a large majority of cases, the impugned price fixed would adversely affect the Fundamental Right of the dealers guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(g), then it might constitute a serious infirmity in the price fixed. In Meenakshi,24 a case dealing with fixation of yarn prices, the Supreme Court refused to intervene stating that even if some producers sustained loss for sometime, it would not be regarded as an unreasonable restriction for the purpose of price fixation was not only to consider the profit of the manufacturer but also to hold the price line. Trade and commerce undergoes periods of prosperity and adversity because of economic, social or political factors. The price fixed had not been shown to be 'arbitrary' or 'so grossly inadequate that it not only results in huge losses but also is a threat to the supply position of yarn'.24 In the matter of fixation of sugar price, items of cost have to be standardised on the basis of representative cross-section of reasonably efficient and economic manufacturing units in a region and it is impractical to take into account the costs incurred by each individual unit.25 In Saraswati Syndicate,26 the Court rejected the writ petition challenging an order fixing ex-factory price of sugar issued under Cl. 7 of the Sugar (Control) Order, 1966. The Court ruled that the price fixed was not shown to be inadequate and there was no breach of any mandatory duty which could justify the issue of mandamus. The Court would not interfere if the basis adopted was not shown to be so patently unreasonable as to be in excess of the price-fixing power. In fixing fair price, no doubt, the criteria adopted must be reasonable and reasonable margin of profit judged by average standard of efficiency should be provided for, but in the instant case, however, the price fixed was not shown to be erroneous or unreasonable, and the government had not acted arbitrarily or unreasonably or taken into consideration any extraneous matter. The Central Government fixed the retention price for each producer of aluminium and its sale price under the Aluminium Control Order, 1970, made under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. The difference between the two prices was paid into the Aluminimum Regulation Account. Out of this fund, contributions were made to the producer whose retention price was higher than the sale price. The scheme of price fixation was held valid inUnion of India v. Hindustan Aluminium Corp. Ltd .27 as it was adopted in the interest of the consumer which was of paramount consideration. \"The interest of producers or manufacturers of an essential commodity is no doubt a factor to be taken into consideration, but surely it is of much lesser importance and must yield to the interest of the general public who are the consumers.\" The loss to industry for a temporary period is no ground to set aside the price fixation of an essential commodity. The Court, however, did emphasize that the government should see that the loss was not perpetual and huge resulting in the closure of the industry.",

    "content": "Court, however, did emphasize that the government should see that the loss was not perpetual and huge resulting in the closure of the industry. In Premier Automobiles, the Court considered the concept of fair price under section 18G of the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951, in relation to the fixing of car prices. The Court explained that it \"takes in all the elements which make it fair for the consumer leaving a reasonable margin of profit to the manufacturer without which no one will engage in any manufacturing activity\". In the instant case, the Court asked the government to review car prices every six months. The fact that in Premier Automobiles, the Court showed some consideration for the interests of the manufacturers may be because a car is not an essential commodity. In Deepak Theatres, Dhuri v. State of Punjab, 28 the Supreme Court has ruled that the power to fix rates of admission to cinema theatres can be validly conferred on the Administration vis-a-vis Art. 19(1)(g) as such a power is clothed with public interest. On the whole, it appears that the Courts have no inclination to police the area of price-fixation. The Courts have conceded a great deal of discretion to the executive in this area. The Courts lean more towards the interests of the consumer rather than that of the manufacturer. As the Supreme Court has said: \"No price fixation order need guarantee profit to an establishment in respect of each unit of article served or sold. It is the over-all picture in the trade and commerce that needs to be examined.\"29 The Administration enjoys quite a good deal of flexibility and it is extremely difficult to challenge successfully a price-fixing order in a Court. Page 1193 The main reason is that the considerations entering into this area are primarily of an economic nature which the Courts can evaluate only superficially, and most of the time they would defer to the administrative judgment in this regard. In this connection, the Supreme Court has said in Prag Ice & Oil Mills.30 \"In the ultimate analysis, the mechanics of price fixation has necessarily to be left to the judgment of the executive and unless it is patent that there is hostile discrimination against a class of operators, the processual basis of price fixation has to be accepted in the generality of cases as valid.\" In the area of the regulation of trade and commerce, the judiciary has hitherto laid more stress on social control and has devalued the individual interest of the trader or the manufacturer. So far, the tenor of Court cases by and large has been to expand the area of social control over trade and commerce and correspondingly to reduce the scope of protection and safeguard to individual interest. In the Chintaman Rao case,31 the Supreme Court had emphasized that a reasonable restriction is one which is not in excess of the requirements of the case. This test involves a drawing of balance between, and a relative evaluation of, the interest of the individual and the exigencies of public control. In the judicial evaluative process of the restrictions under Art. 19(6), however, this approach has by and large been ignored. The consideration whether in a given situation the restriction imposed is in excess of the needs of social control has been rather absent in judicial pronouncements. In this area, the Courts have shown much deference to the legislative and administrative judgment. Hitherto, the judicial approach appears to have been very much coloured by the prevailing philosophy of a socialist pattern of society in the country. But, it remains to be seen, whether, in course of time, this judicial attitude will undergo a change in view of the toning down of the socialist rhetoric and the contemporary philosophy of liberalisation and privatisation. 1.

M P Jain Indian Constitutional Law/Volume 1/PART V POLITICAL AND CIVIL RIGHTS/CHAPTER XXV FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS (6) CHAPTER XXV Fundamental Rights (6) A. PROTECTION AGAINSTEX-POST-FACTOLAW An ex-post-facto law is a law which imposes penalties retroactively, that is, upon acts already done, or which increases the penalty for the past acts.1 Suppose a person does an act in 1954 which is not then unlawful. A law is passed in 1956 making that act a criminal offence and seeking to punish that person for what he did in 1954. Or, suppose, punishment prescribed for an offence in 1954 is six months' imprisonment, but the punishment for the same offence is increased in 1955 to imprisonment for a year, and is made applicable to the offences committed before 1955. These are both examples of ex-post-facto laws. Such laws are regarded as inequitable and abhorrent to the notions of justice and, therefore, there are (constitutional safeguards against such laws. (a) ARTICLE 20(1) : FIRST PART Page 1210 Article 20(1) provides the necessary protection against an ex-post-facto law. Article 20(1)has two parts.",

    "content": "are both examples of ex-post-facto laws. Such laws are regarded as inequitable and abhorrent to the notions of justice and, therefore, there are (constitutional safeguards against such laws. (a) ARTICLE 20(1) : FIRST PART Page 1210 Article 20(1) provides the necessary protection against an ex-post-facto law. Article 20(1)has two parts. Under the first part, no person is to be convicted of an offence except for violating a 'law in force' at the time of commission of the act charged as an offence. A person is to be convicted for violating a law in force when the act charged is committed. A law enacted later, making an act done earlier (not an offence when done) as an offence, will not make the person liable for being convicted under it.2 An immunity is thus provided to a person from being tried for an act, under a law enacted subsequently, which makes the act unlawful.3 This means that if an act is not an offence on the date of its commission, a law enacted in future cannot make it so.4 This proposition is illustrated by the following fact situation. Section 304B , IPC, was enacted on 19-11-1986 making a dowry death punishable as an offence under the Penal Code. A new offence has thus been inserted in the IPC with effect from 19-11-1986. Because of Art. 20(1),S. 304B cannot be applied to a dowry death which took place in 1984, i.e., prior to its enactment. S. 304B is a substantive provision creating a new offence subsequent to the commission of the offence attributed to the respondent in the instant case and so he could not be tried under section 304B. In Sakshi v. Union of India5 the court refused to give an enlarged meaning to the word \"rape\" in section 375IPC on the ground that such an interpretation may violate Article 20(1) The word 'offence' used in Art. 20 is not defined in the Constitution. S. 3(38)of the General Clauses Act defines 'offence' as any act or omission made punishable by any law for the time being in force. Article 20 relates to the constitutional protection given to persons who are charged with a crime before a criminal court. The word 'penalty' in Art. 20(1) is used in the narrow sense as meaning a payment \"which has to be made or a deprivation of liberty which has to be suffered as a consequence of finding that the person accused of a crime is guilty of the charge.\"6 The immunity extends only against punishment by courts for a criminal offence under an ex-post-facto law, and cannot be claimed against preventive detention,7 or demanding a security from a press under a press law,8 for acts done before the relevant law is passed. Article 20(1)does not bar a civil liability being imposed retrospectively. An Act passed in June, 1957, imposed on the employers closing their undertakings a liability to pay compensation to their employees since November 28, 1956. This liability could be enforced by coercive process leading to imprisonment in case of failure to discharge it. The Supreme Court held that the liability imposed by the law was a civil liability which was not an offence and so Art. 20(1)could not apply to the liability for the period November 28, 1956 to June, 1957.9 Similarly, a tax can be imposed retrospectively.10 Imposing retrospectively special rates for unauthorized use of canal water is not hit by Art. 20(1).11 In this case, unauthorized use of canal water has not been made an offence retrospectively, merely the rate for water used has been enhanced. What is prohibited under Art. 20(1)is only conviction or sentence, but not trial, under an ex-post-facto law. The objection does not apply to a change of procedure or of court. A trial under a procedure different from what obtained at the time of the commission of the offence, or by a court different from that which had competence at the time cannot ipso facto be held unconstitutional. A person being accused of having committed an offence has no Fundamental Right of being tried by a particular court or procedure, except in so far as any constitutional objection by way of discrimination or violation of any other Fundamental Right may be involved. Art 20(1) does not make a right to any course of procedure a vested right. Thus, a law which retrospectively changes the venue of trial of an offence from a criminal court to an administrative tribunal is not hit by Art. 20(1).12 A change in the courts entitled to try an offence is not hit by Art. 20(1).13 Similarly, a rule of evidence can be made applicable to the trial of an offence committed earlier.14 Page 1211 In order to punish corrupt government officers, Parliament has enacted the Prevention of Corruption Act which creates the offence of criminal misconduct.S. 5(3) creates a presumption to the effect that if the government servant for corruption has in his possession property or assets which were wholly disproportionate to his known sources of income and if he cannot explain the same satisfactorily, then he is guilty of criminal misconduct. Section 5(3)was challenged before the Supreme Court in Sajjan Singh v. State of Punjab, 15vis-a-visArt. 20(1). It was argued that when S. 5(3) speaks of the accused being in possession of pecuniary resources, or property disproportionate to his known sources of income, only the pecuniary resources or property acquired after the date of the Act is meant. To think otherwise would be to give the Act retrospective operation and for this there is no justification. The Supreme Courtrejected the contention that to take into consideration the pecuniary resources or property in the possession of the accused, or any other person on his behalf, which are acquired before the date of the Act is in any way giving the Act a retrospective operation.",

    "content": "think otherwise would be to give the Act retrospective operation and for this there is no justification. The Supreme Courtrejected the contention that to take into consideration the pecuniary resources or property in the possession of the accused, or any other person on his behalf, which are acquired before the date of the Act is in any way giving the Act a retrospective operation. The Court explained the position as follows: \"A statute cannot be said to be retrospective because a part of the requisites for its actions is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing\". The Court also rejected the contention that S. 5(3) creates a new offence in the discharge of official duty. According to the Court, S. 5(3) does not create a new offence. The Court stated further: \"It merely prescribes a rule of evidence for the purpose of proving the offence of criminal misconduct as defined in S. 5(1)for which an accused person is already under trial....When there is such a trial which necessarily must be in respect of acts committed after the Prevention of Corruption Act came into force,S. 5(3) places in the hands of the prosecution a new mode of proving an offence with which an accused has already been charged.\"16 A person can be convicted and punished under a 'law in force' which means a law 'factually' in existence at the time the offence was committed. A law passed on September 30, but given an operation from August 1, cannot be taken to be a law in force on August 1, and so an act committed on August 1, cannot be punished thereunder. A law not factually in existence at the time, enacted subsequently, but by a legislative declaration 'deemed' to have become operative from an earlier date (by a fiction of law), cannot be considered to be a law 'factually' in force earlier than the date of its enactment and the infirmity applying to an ex-post-facto law applies to it. The reason is that if such a fiction were accepted, and a law passed later were to be treated as a law in existence earlier, then the whole purpose of the protection against an ex-post-facto law would be frustrated, for a legislature could then give a retrospective operation to any law.17 A slightly different situation is presented by the following fact-situation. A law was made in 1923, and certain rules were made thereunder. The Act of 1923 was replaced in 1952 by another Act, but the old rules were deemed to be the rules under the new Act as well. As these rules had been operative all along and did not constitute retrospective legislation, an offence committed in 1955 could be punishable under them as these were factually in existence at the date of the commission of the offence.18 When a later statute again describes an offence created by a statute enacted earlier, and the later statute imposes a different punishment, the earlier statute is repealed by implication. But this is subject to Art. 20(1) against ex post factolaw providing for a greater punishment. The later Act will have no application if the offence described therein is not the same as in the earlier Act, i.e., if the essential ingredients of the two offences are different. If the later Act creates new offences, or enhances punishment for the same offence, no person can be convicted under such an ex post factolaw nor can the enhanced punishment prescribed in the later Act apply to a person who had committed the offence before the enactment of the later law.19 Further, what Art. 20(1) prohibits is conviction and sentence under an ex-post-facto law for acts done prior thereto, but not the enactment or validity of such a law. There is, thus, a difference between the Indian and the American positions on this point. Whereas in America, an ex-post-facto law is in itself invalid, it is not so Page 1212 in India. The courts may also interpret a law in such a manner that any objection against it of retrospective operation may be removed.20 (b) ARTICLE 20(1) : SECOND PART The second part of Art. 20(1) immunizes a person from a penalty greater than what he might have incurred at the time of his committing the offence. Thus, a person cannot be made to suffer more by an ex-post-facto law than what he would be subjected to at the time he committed the offence.21 The clause applies to punishment for criminal offences. X committed an offence in 1947 under the Prevention of Corruption Act which then prescribed a punishment of imprisonment or fine or both. In 1949, by an amendment of the law, the punishment was enhanced. TheSupreme Court held that the enhanced punishment could not be applicable to the offence committed in 1947 because of the prohibition contained in Art. 20(1).22 The scope of Art. 20(1) has been fully considered by a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in K. Satwant Singh v. State of Punjab.23 According to S. 420,I.P.C., no minimum sentence of fine has been provided and under it an unlimited fine can be imposed. S. committed an offence punishable under the provision. Later, in 1943, an ordinance laid down the minimum fine which a court must compulsorily inflict on a person convicted underS. 420. The Supreme Court held that Art. 20(1) was not infringed by the trial of S. under the ordinance because the minimum penalty prescribed by it could not be said to be greater than what could be inflicted on S. under the law (S. 420) in force at the time he committed the offence. Under Art. 20, all that has to be considered is whether the ex-post-facto law imposes a penalty greater than that which might be inflicted under the law in force at the time of commission of the offence. The total sentence of fine--'ordinary' and 'compulsory'--in the present case could not be said to be greater than what might have been inflicted under S.",

Under Art. 20, all that has to be considered is whether the ex-post-facto law imposes a penalty greater than that which might be inflicted under the law in force at the time of commission of the offence. The total sentence of fine--'ordinary' and 'compulsory'--in the present case could not be said to be greater than what might have been inflicted under S. 420, the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence, because the fine which could have been imposed upon under S. 420 , IPC, was unlimited. A law providing for a minimum sentence of fine on conviction does not impose a greater penalty than what might have been inflicted under the law at the time of the commission of the offence when such a law authorised imposition of an unlimited fine for the same offence.24 A government servant embezzled government money before August 1944, when he was suspended. An ordinance, dated August 23, 1944, provided that from the property of a person convicted for embezzlement, the amount embezzled by him was to be forfeited. The ordinance was held valid as it did not impose a penalty within Art. 20(1), but merely laid down a method of recovering money belonging to the government which had been embezzled. The government could have filed a suit to recover the money but the provision in question provided for a speedier remedy to recover the same.25 Imposing or increasing a penalty with retrospective effect for violation of a taxing statute does not infringe Art. 20(1). The reason for this proposition has been explained by the Supreme Court in Shiv Dutt Rai Fateh Chand v. Union of India .26 Art. 20 contemplates proceedings in the nature of criminal proceedings and it does not apply to proceedings under a sales tax law which have a civil sanction and are of a revenue nature. The word 'penalty' in Art. 20(1) does not include a 'penalty' under a tax law levied by departmental authorities for violation of statutory provisions. A penalty imposed by such an authority \"is only a civil liability, though penal in character.\" Art. 20(1) applies when a punishment is imposed for offences through criminal prosecution (even under tax laws). An ex post facto law which only mollifies the rigours of a criminal law is not within the prohibition of Art. 20(1). Therefore, an accused should have the benefit of a retrospective or retroactive criminal legislation reducing punishment for an offence.27 This proposition is well illustrated by Rattan Lal v. State of Punjab .28 A boy of 16 years of age was found guilty of an offence and was awarded a rigorous imprisonment of six months and also imposed a fine on 31-5-1962. His appeal was dismissed by the sessions judge on 22-9-1962 and by the High Court on 27-9-1962. The Probation of Offenders Act came into force on 1-9-1962. Page 1213 No plea was taken before the High Court that the boy should be given the benefit of the Act. Later, he filed an appeal in theSupreme Courtby special leave and it was argued that he should be given the benefit of the Act. The Government argued, on the other hand, that the Act is not retrospective and the offence was committed much before the Act came in force. But the Supreme Court disagreed with the Government's contention. The Court observed: \"But an ex post facto law which only mollifies the rigour of a criminal law does not fall within the said prohibition [i.e., of Art. 20(1)]. If a particular law makes a provision to that effect, though retrospective in operation, it will be valid.\" The Court, therefore, ruled that the rule of beneficent construction required that even an ex post facto law of the type involved here ought to be applied to reduce the punishment of the young offender. But where the law itself is amended Article 20(1) may be attracted. Thus the court refused to read an expanded definition of \"workman\" in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 as operating retrospectively because it would render the employer punishable for an offence underSections 25-N and 25-Q which he could not have envisaged on the date of dismissal and it would be violative of Article 20(1).29 (c) JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION Interpreting s. 494,I.P.C., theSupreme Court ruled in 1995 in Sarla Mudgal v. India30 that the second marriage of a Hindu husband after conversion to Islam without having his first marriage dissolved according to law, would be invalid and the husband would be guilty of the offence under s. 494,I.P.C. It was later argued in Lily Thomas v. Union of India31 that the law declared by the Supreme Court in Sarla Mudgal could not be given retrospective effect because of Art. 20(1); it ought to be given only prospective operation so that the ruling could not be applied to a person who had already solemnised the second marriage prior to the date of the Sarla Mudgal judgement. The Supreme Court rejected the contention arguing that it had not laid down any new law in Sarla Mudgal. What the Court did in that case was only to interpret the law which had always been in existence. It is the settled principle that the interpretation of a provision of law relates back to the date of the law itself and cannot be prospective from the date of the judgment because the Court does not legislate but only interprets an existing law. B. GUARANTEE AGAINST DOUBLE JEOPARDY (a) PRINCIPLE OF DOUBLE JEOPARDY The roots of the doctrine against double jeopardy are to be found in the well-established maxim of the English Common law, Nemo debet bis vexari, meaning that a man must not be put twice in peril for the same offence. When a person has been convicted for an offence by a competent court, the conviction serves as a bar to any further criminal proceedings against him for the same offence.",

    "content": "GUARANTEE AGAINST DOUBLE JEOPARDY (a) PRINCIPLE OF DOUBLE JEOPARDY The roots of the doctrine against double jeopardy are to be found in the well-established maxim of the English Common law, Nemo debet bis vexari, meaning that a man must not be put twice in peril for the same offence. When a person has been convicted for an offence by a competent court, the conviction serves as a bar to any further criminal proceedings against him for the same offence. The idea is that no one ought to be punished twice for one and the same offence. If a person is indicted again for the same offence in a court, he can plead, as a complete defence, his formal acquittal or conviction, or, as it is technically expressed, he can take the plea of autrefois acquit or autrefoisconvict. The Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution provides inter alia: \"Nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be put twice in jeopardy of life or limb.\" In the U.S.A., the protection is not only against a second punishment but even against the peril in which a person is placed by the second trial for the same offence. (b) SCOPE OF ARTICLE 20(2) Article 20(2) which runs as \"No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once\" contains the rule against double jeopardy. Page 1214 The principle was in existence in India even prior to the commencement of the Constitution,32 but the same has now been given the status of a constitutional, rather than a mere statutory, guarantee. The ambit of Art. 20(2) is, however, narrower than the English or the American rule against double jeopardy. The Indian provision enunciates only the principle of autrefois convict but not that of autrefois acquit. In Britain and the U.S.A., both these rules operate and a second trial is barred even when the accused has been acquitted at the first trial for that offence. In India, on the other hand, the rule of autrefois acquit is not incorporated in Art. 20(2). Art. 20(2) may be invoked only when there has been prosecution and punishment in the first instance. Both prosecution and punishment should co-exist for Art. 20(2) to be operative. A prosecution without punishment would not bring the case within Art. 20(2). If a person has been prosecuted for an offence but acquitted, then he can be prosecuted for the same offence again and punished. The distinct language of Article 20(2) appears to have been overlooked by the Supreme Court in Mukhtiar Ahmed Ansari v. State (NCT of Delhi)33.In connection with an incident of kidnapping and extortion, the accused was booked under the Arms Act as well as under TADA. He was also charged in a kidnapping case along with two others. He was acquitted in the kidnapping case. TheSupreme Courtset aside the sentence passed against the accused under TADA as also under the Arms Act on the ground that \"once the accused was acquitted in kidnapping case the doctrine ofautrefois acquit gets attracted\".34 A person accused of committing a murder was tried and acquitted. The State preferred an appeal against the acquittal. The accused could not plead Art. 20(2) against the State preferring an appeal against the acquittal. Art. 20(2) would not apply as there was no punishment for the offence at the earlier prosecution; and an appeal against an acquittal was in substance a continuation of the prosecution.35 When a person is neither convicted nor acquitted of the charges against him in the first trial, a retrial in such a case would not amount to double jeopardy.36 A person was prosecuted and punished under S. 161,I.P.C. On appeal, the High Court quashed the trial holding it voidab initio as no sanction for the same had been obtained under the law. Art. 20(2) would not bar a second trial for the same offence, as the accused had not been prosecuted and punished for that offence.37 When a trial has for some reason become abortive either because of some inherent defect or illegality affecting the validity of the trial itself, a second trial is not barred by Art. 20(2).38 Where there are two distinct offences made up of different ingredients, embargo under Art. 20(2) or S. Section 26General Clauses Act 1897 has no application, though the offences may have some overlapping features. Offences under Section 302IPC Section 3(2) and Section 3(3) of POTA are all distinct offences and a person can be charged, tried, convicted and punished for each of them severally.39 When at the instance of the accused himself the authorities took steps to dissolve the court and constitute a fresh court to protect the interest of the accused, the question of double jeopardy does not arise because the accused was not either convicted or acquitted of the charges against him in the first trial.40 Enhancement of punishment by the revising authority does not amount to a second punishment.41 Preventive detention is not 'prosecution and punishment' and, therefore, it does not bar prosecution of the person concerned.42 Further, Art. 20(2) can operate as a bar only when the second prosecution and punishment is for the identical offence for which the person concerned has already been prosecuted and punished earlier. The same offence means an offence whose ingredients are the same. If the offences are distinct, there is no question of the rule as to double jeopardy being applicable. If one and the same act of a person constitutes two different offences, then the punishment for one offence does not bar prosecution and punishment for the other offence.43 The same set of facts, in some cases, can constitute offences under two different laws. An act or omission can amount to and may constitute an offence under the Indian Penal Code and at the same time may constitute an offence under any other law. As theSupreme Court has observed in Murad Ali:44\"In order that Page 1215 the prohibition [under Art.",

    "content": "act or omission can amount to and may constitute an offence under the Indian Penal Code and at the same time may constitute an offence under any other law. As theSupreme Court has observed in Murad Ali:44\"In order that Page 1215 the prohibition [under Art. 20(2)] is attracted the same act must constitute an offence under more than one Act. If there are two distinct and separate offences with different ingredients under two different enactments, a double punishment is not barred.\" The Supreme Court has explained the legal position as follows in Apte:45 \"To operate as a bar the second prosecution and the consequential punishment thereunder, must be for the 'same offence'. The crucial requirement therefore for attracting the Article is that the offences are the same, i.e., they should be identical. If, however, the two offences are distinct, then notwithstanding that the allegations of facts in the two complaints might be substantially similar, the benefit of the ban cannot be invoked. It is, therefore, necessary to analyze and compare not the allegations in the two complaints but the ingredients of the two offences and see whether their identity is made out....\" In Apte, a person was convicted under S. 409,I.P.C., for criminal breach of trust. His later prosecution on the same facts under S. Section 105 of the Insurance Act would not be barred under Art. 20(2) because the ingredients of the two offences were different. The Court emphasized that the crucial requirement for attracting Art. 20(2) is that the offences are the same,i.e. they should be identical. If the two offences are distinct, then, notwithstanding that the allegations of facts in the two complaints are substantially the same, the benefit of the ban cannot be invoked. \"It is therefore necessary to analyse and compare not the allegations in the two complaints but the ingredients of the two offences and see whether their identity is made out...\" In Leo Roy Frey,46 the question arose whether a crime and the offence of conspiracy to commit the crime are different offences. The petitioner in the instant case was found guilty of an offence under S. 107(8),Sea Customs Act, 1878, and was punished accordingly. Thereafter, prosecution for criminal conspiracy under S. 120 -B, Penal Code, was brought against him. TheSupreme Court ruled that the second prosecution was not barred since it was not for the same offence. The Court explained the position thus: The offence of a conspiracy to commit a crime is an offence separate from the crime itself which is the object of the conspiracy, because the conspiracy precedes the commission of the crime and is complete before the crime is attempted or committed. Equally the crime attempted or completed does not require the element of conspiracy as one of its ingredients. The two are therefore quite separate offences. Accordingly, punishment for one offence does not bar punishment later for the other. Similarly, the offence under S. 161,I.P.C., is different from the offence of criminal misconduct punishable underS. 5(2)of the Prevention of Corruption Act, though some of the ingredients of the two offences may be common. Therefore, punishment for one does not bar punishment for the other though both the offences may arise from the same facts.47 In Agarwal,48the accused was convicted under the Customs Act. He was later sought to be prosecuted under the Gold (Control) Act. TheSupreme Courtruled that the ingredients required to be established under the Customs Act are different from the ones required to be established for an offence under the Gold (Control)Act and, therefore, Art. 20(2) does not come into the picture. If the ingredients of both the offences are satisfied, the same act of possession of gold would constitute offences under both the Acts. The petitioner in the instant case was not being prosecuted for the same offence twice but for two distinct offences constituted of different ingredients, and the bar of Art. 20(2) does not apply in such a situation. The appellant had been tried earlier under Ss. 399 and 402, I.P.C. andS. 3 of TADA for having a fire arm in possession and preparing and assembling for committing a dacoity. Later he was tried under TADA (S. 5) essentially for unauthorised possession of a stengun. In the earlier case, the question of possession of the stengun was considered but the prosecution evidence was not believed then. The Supreme Court in Mohinder Singh,49 rejected the contention that the accused was being tried twice for the same offence. When a person was convicted in the USA under its drug laws and on the same set of facts tried in India under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, it was held the application of the principle of double jeopardy was not available since the offences in the USA and India were distinct and separate.50 Page 1216 An employee of the Border Road Organisation was court-martialled and found to be guilty of some of the charges framed against him and was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year. Thereafter, he was dismissed from service under the relevant Service Rules. The Supreme Court ruled in Unin of India v. Sunil Kumar Sarkar51that it did not amount to double jeopardy under Art. 20(2). The two proceedings operated in two different fields even though the crime or the misconduct might arise out of the same act. The two proceedings did not overlap--court-martial proceedings dealt with penal aspect of the misconduct while the proceedings under the Service Rules dealt with the disciplinary aspect of the misconduct. Article 20(2) does not apply to departmental proceedings.",

    "content": "20(2) does not apply to departmental proceedings. So an employee punished by a reduction of pay because of rash and negligent driving can subsequently be dismissed from service upon his conviction by a criminal court in respect of the same incident.52 Then there is also the concept of a 'continuing offence' which means that where an act or commission constituting the offence is continued from day to day, a fresh offence is committed every day and each offence can be punished separately.53 (c) PROSECUTION A limitation read into Art. 20(2) is that the former 'prosecution' (which indicates that the proceedings are of a criminal nature) must be before a court of law, or a judicial tribunal required by law to decide matters in controversy judicially on evidence and on oath which it must be authorised by law to administer, and not before a tribunal which entertains a departmental or administrative enquiry, even though set up by a statute, but not required to proceed on legal evidence given on oath. The words 'before a court of law or judicial tribunal', though not found specifically in the Article, have, nevertheless, been read therein. When a civil servant is dismissed from government service on the ground of misbehaviour after a departmental inquiry, his later prosecution on the same charges which had been earlier inquired into and for which he was punished by dismissal would not be barred by Art. 20(2). The earlier 'inquiry' could not be regarded as 'prosecution' for a criminal offence and so Art. 20(2) would not apply. Thus, a departmental inquiry does not bar a later prosecution and punishment in a court.54 The Court has explained the legal position under Art. 20(2) as follows: To invoke the protection of Art. 20(2), there must have been both prosecution and punishment in respect of the same offence. The words \"prosecuted and punished\" are to be taken not distributively so as to mean 'prosecuted' or punished. Both the factors must co-exist in order that the operation of Art. 20(2) may be attracted. When a departmental inquiry is held against a civil servant under the Public Servants (Inquiries) Act of 1850, he is not 'prosecuted' and 'punished' for an offence as contemplated by Art. 20(2). Explaining the nature of the inquiry commissioner appointed under the Inquiries Act, the Supreme Court has observed in Venkataraman:55 \"A commissioner appointed under this Act has no duty to investigate any offence which is punishable under the Indian Penal Codeor the Prevention of Corruption Act and he has absolutely no jurisdiction to do so. The subject matter of investigation by him is the truth or otherwise of the imputation of misbehavior made against a public servant and it is only as instances of misbehaviour that the several articles of charge are investigated, upon which disciplinary action might be taken by the Government if it so chooses.\" The opinion expressed by the commissioner after the inquiry is not binding. \"This is a mere expression of opinion and it lacks both finality and authoritativeness which are the essential tests of a judicial pronouncement.\" In the instant case, V., a government servant, was dismissed after an inquiry under the Public Servants (Inquiries) Act. Thereafter he was tried under Ss. 161 and 165, Penal Code, and S. 5(2) of the Prevention of CorruptionAct. His subsequent trial was held not barred by Art. 20(2). The earlier inquiry did not amount to prosecution because in an inquiry under the Act there was neither any question of investigating an offence in the sense of an act or omission punishable by any law which made that act or omission an offence. Page 1217 Maqbool Hussain,56is the leading case on this point. A person arrived at an Indian airport from abroad. He was found in possession of gold which was against the law at the time. Action was taken against him by the customs authorities and the gold was confiscated. Later he was prosecuted before a criminal court under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act. The question was whether the plea of 'autrefois acquit' could be raised under Art. 20(2). The Supreme Court came to the conclusion that the proceedings before the customs authorities did not constitute 'prosecution' of the appellant, and the penalty imposed on him did not constitute a 'punishment' by a judicial tribunal. In these circumstances, the trial of the petitioner before the criminal court was not barred. The Court observed: \"It is clear that in order that the protection of Art. 20(2) be invoked by a citizen there must have been a prosecution and punishment in respect of the same offence before a court of law or a tribunal, required by law to decide the matters in controversy judicially on oath which it must be authorised by law to administer and not before a tribunal which entertains a departmental or an administrative enquiry even though set up by a statute but not required to proceed on legal evidence given on oath. The every wording of Art. 20 and the words used therein: \"convicted\", \"commission of the act charged as an offence,\" \"be subjected to a penalty\" \"commission of the offence\", \"prosecuted and punished\", \"accused of any offence\", would indicate that the proceedings therein contemplated are of the nature of criminal proceedings before a court of law or a judicial tribunal and the prosecution in this context would mean an initiation or starting of proceedings of a criminal nature before a court of law or a judicial tribunal in accordance with the procedure prescribed in the statute which creates the offence and regulates the procedure\". The Court ruled that the sea customs authorities are not a judicial tribunal and adjudging by it of confiscation, increased rate of duty or penalty under the provisions of the Sea Customs Act do not constitute a judgment or order of a court or judicial tribunal necessary for the purpose of supporting the plea of double jeopardy.",

    "content": "Court ruled that the sea customs authorities are not a judicial tribunal and adjudging by it of confiscation, increased rate of duty or penalty under the provisions of the Sea Customs Act do not constitute a judgment or order of a court or judicial tribunal necessary for the purpose of supporting the plea of double jeopardy. Therefore, when the customs authorities confiscated the gold, the proceedings before them neither constituted a prosecution of the appellant nor did the offer of confiscation constitute a punishment inflicted by a court or judicial tribunal on the appellant. The appellant could not be said by virtue of these proceedings to have been \"prosecuted and punished\" for the same offence with which he was charged later before the criminal court under s. Section 23, Foreign Exchange Regulation Act. Similarly, in the case mentioned below,57 the Supreme Courthas ruled that the adjudicatory authorities functioning under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act do not function as criminal courts. The proceedings before them are \"adjudicatory\" in nature and character and are not \"criminal proceedings.\" These authorities \"adjudicate\" following rules of natural justice but they are not judges of criminal courts trying an \"accused\" for commission of an offence. Therefore, any penalty imposed by them does not bar a prosecution before a criminal court and the bar under Art. 20(2) would not be attracted in such a case. On the same logic, conviction by a court on a criminal charge would not bar the holding of a departmental inquiry later for the same charge or on the same facts.58 Similarly, punishment for a jail offence by the jail Superintendent would not bar prosecution and punishment in a court for the same offence, for the jail Superintendent acts as an administrative authority to maintain discipline and inflicts summary punishment for breach of discipline and proceedings before him are not judicial in nature. Levy of penalty for default in payment of sales-tax is not 'prosecution' so as to bar a subsequent prosecution in a criminal court for the offence.59For breach of permit rules under the Influx from Pakistan Control Act, punishment through a court, and his removal from India through a direction of the Government of India do not constitute 'double jeopardy', as the latter does not involve second prosecution.60 Confiscation of goods under the Sea Customs Act does not bar a prosecution of the person concerned for a criminal offence, for the customs authorities not being judicial authorities, action taken by them (confiscation of gold) was neither prosecution nor punishment before a court or a judicial tribunal for purposes of Art. 20(2)61 In Thomas Dana v. State of Punjab, 62the facts were as follows: D, the appellant, sought to take out some foreign exchange from India which was confiscated by the customs authorities after following due procedure under the Sea Customs Act. Later he was prosecuted before a criminal court under the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act and the Sea Customs Act and he was duly convicted for the offence. The High Court dismissed his appeal. He then filed a writ petition in theSupreme Court against his conviction on Page 1218 the ground that Art. 20(2) barred his prosecution. The Supreme Courtdismissed the petition. In imposing confiscation and penalty under the Sea Customs Act and FERA, the concerned authority acts judicially but it is not a court. The proceedings before the officer do not amount to \"prosecution\" within the meaning of Art. 20(2). Therefore, the later prosecution before a criminal court would not be hit by Art. 20(2). It is thus established that action taken by a quasi-judicial body does not bar a later prosecution before a court. Thus, immunity against a second prosecution has become confined to a situation when the first proceeding has been before a court of law. The same will be the position when after 'prosecution and punishment' for an offence, further action is taken by a quasi-judicial body.63 This excludes the vast system of inquiries and punishments by a number of quasi-judicial bodies which operate at present in the country.64 This is because the word 'prosecution' in Art. 20(2) has been interpreted restrictively. The scope of Art. 20(2) has thus been very much narrowed down by judicial interpretation.65 Article 20(2) is limited to indictment before a criminal court. Therefore, Art. 20(2) does not bar proceedings before a civil court for disobedience of an injunction along with criminal proceedings, as the former are not in the nature of criminal proceedings.66 C. PRIVILEGE AGAINST SELF-INCRIMINATION: ART. 20(3) (a) U.S.A. The Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution provides inter alia: \"No person ....... shall be compelled in any criminal case, to be a witness against himself.\" By judicial interpretation, the above provision has been given a very wide connotation. The privilege against self-incrimination has been held to apply to witnesses as well as parties in proceedings--civil and criminal. It covers documentary evidence and oral evidence, and extends to all disclosures including answers which by themselves support a criminal conviction, or furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed for a conviction.67 (b) BRITAIN It is a fundamental principle of the common law that a person accused of an offence shall not be compelled to discover documents or objects which incriminate himself. No witness, whether party or stranger is, except in a few cases, compellable to answer any question or to produce any document the tendency of which is to expose the witness (or the wife or husband of the witness), to any criminal charge, penalty or forfeiture. The privilege is based on the policy of encouraging persons to come forward with evidence in courts of justice, by protecting them, as far as possible, from injury, or needless annoyance, in consequence of so doing.68 (c) INDIA The privilege against self-incrimination is a fundamental canon of common-law criminal jurisprudence.",

    "content": "privilege is based on the policy of encouraging persons to come forward with evidence in courts of justice, by protecting them, as far as possible, from injury, or needless annoyance, in consequence of so doing.68 (c) INDIA The privilege against self-incrimination is a fundamental canon of common-law criminal jurisprudence. The characteristic features of this principle are-- (i) that the accused is presumed to be innocent, (ii) that it is for the prosecution to establish his guilt, and (iii) that the accused need not make any statement against his will. These propositions emanate from an apprehension that if compulsory examination of an accused were to be permitted then force and torture may be used against him to entrap him into fatal contradictions. The privilege against self-incrimination thus enables the maintenance of human privacy and observance of civilized standards in the enforcement of criminal justice. Page 1219 Article 20(3) which embodies this privilege reads: 'No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.\" On analysis, this provision will be found to contain the following components: (1) it is a right available to a person 'accused of an offence'; (2) it is a protection against 'compulsion' 'to be a witness'; (3) it is a protection against such 'compulsion' resulting in his giving evidence 'against himself'. All the three ingredients must necessarily co-exist before the protection of Art. 20(3) can be claimed. If any of these ingredients is missing, Art. 20(3) cannot be invoked. Each of these ingredients is discussed below. (d) TYPES OF INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE COVERED BY ART. 20(3) The privilege applies to 'testimonial compulsion'. It no doubt covers oral testimony by an accused. But judicial opinion has fluctuated on the question whether Art. 20(3) covers something more besides oral evidence. In M.P. Sharma v. Satish Chandra,69 the Supreme Court taking a broad view of Art. 20(3) stated that to limit Art. 20(3) to the oral evidence of a person standing trial for an offence is \"to confine the content of the constitutional guarantee to its barely literal import\"; and so to limit Art. 20(3) would be to rob the guarantee of its substantial purpose and to miss the substance. A person can be a witness not merely by giving oral evidence but also by producing documents or making intelligible gestures as in the case of a dumb witness. The phrase 'to be a witness' in Art. 20(3), the Court ruled, meant nothing more than 'to furnish evidence' and this could be done through lips, or by production of a thing or a document, or in any other mode. Every positive volitional act which furnishes evidence is testimony, and testimonial compulsion connotes coercion which procures the positive volitional evidentiary acts of the person as opposed to the negative attitude of silence or submission on his part. The Supreme Court ruling in Sharma v. Satish, thus gave a broad import to Art. 20(3) as it was held to cover not only oral testimony or statements in writing of the accused but also production of a thing or of evidence by other modes. The Supreme Court reconsidered the matter in State of Bombay v. Kathi Kalu Oghad.70 A bench of eleven Judges was constituted to consider the issues involved. The main question involved was whether Art. 20(3) is violated when the accused is directed to give his specimen hand writing, or signature, or the impression of his palms and fingers. The answer to this question depended on the interpretation of the words \"to be a witness\" found in Art. 20(3). The Court now ruled that Art. 20(3) is not violated in any of the above situations. The Court stated that \"self-incrimination must mean conveying information based upon the personal knowledge of the person giving information\" and covers only \"personal testimony which must depend upon his volition\". The Court stated in Oghad: \" 'To be a witness' may be equivalent to 'furnishing evidence' in the sense of making oral or written statement, but not in the larger sense of the expression so as to include giving of thumb impression or impression of palm or foot or fingers or specimen writing or exposing a part of the body by an accused person for purposes of identification.\" The Court emphasized that it is as much necessary to protect an accused person against being compelled to incriminate himself, as to arm the agents of law and the law courts with legitimate powers of bringing offenders to justice. The Court stated regarding production of documents in the possession of the accused, that \"if it is a document which is not his statement conveying his personal knowledge relating to the charge against him, he may be called upon by the court to produce that document.\" Several types of evidence are excluded from the purview of Art. 20(3). This is done with a view to draw a Page 1220 balance between the exigencies of investigation of crimes and the need to safeguard the individual from being subjected to third degree methods. The plea that once the police accosted a person who was suspected of possessing contraband opium, he must be deemed to be under arrest and therefore any confession made by him could not be used against him was held to be unsustainable.71 The Court has reiterated that the prohibition in Art. 20(3) covers oral testimony given by a person accused of an offence both in and out of the court, as well as the written statements by him having a bearing on the controversy with reference to the charges against him. But Art. 20(3) would not include signature, thumb impression, impression of the palm or foot or fingers, or specimen of handwriting, or exposing parts of his body by an accused for purposes of identification.",

    "content": "\"it may amount to furnishing evidence in the larger sense, is not included within the expression to be a witness\".72 On the relevant date, when the specimen signatures were obtained, the investigation was not done under the POTA provisions and dehors the provisions of POTA, hence there was no legal bar against obtaining the handwriting samples of the accused, as provided for in Section 27 of POTA.73 Article 20(3) is also not violated when a police officer investigating a case seeks direction through the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate or the Court of a Chief Metropolitan Magistrate for obtaining samples of handwriting, fingerprints, footprints, photographs, blood, saliva, semen, hair, voice of any accused person reasonably suspected to be involved in the commission of an offence under the Act under Section 27 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002.74 The accused may have documentary evidence in his possession which may throw some light on the controversy. If it is a document which is not his statement conveying his personal knowledge relating to the charge against him, he may be called upon by the court to produce the same. On this point, the Court stated in Oghad: The accused person may be in possession of a document which is in his handwriting or which contains his signature or his thumb impression. The production of such a document, with a view to comparison of the writing or the signature or the impression, \"is not the statement of an accused person, which can be said to be of the nature of a personal testimony.\" The Court observed further: \"When an accused person is called upon by the Court or any other authority holding an investigation to give his finger impression or signature or a specimen of his handwriting, he is not giving any testimony of the nature of a 'personal testimony'. The giving of a 'personal testimony' must depend upon his volition. He can make any kind of statement or may refuse to make any statement. But his finger impressions or his handwriting, in spite of efforts at concealing the true nature of it by dissimulation cannot change their intrinsic character. Thus, the giving of finger impressions or of specimen writing or of signatures by an accused person, though it may amount to furnishing evidence in the larger sense, is not included within the expression 'to be a witness'.\"75 Art. 20(3) is directed against self-incrimination by an accused. Self-incrimination must mean conveying information based upon the personal knowledge of the person giving the information and cannot include merely the mechanical process of producing documents in court which may throw light on any point in controversy, but which do not contain any statement of the accused based on his personal knowledge. Section 73, Evidence Act, authorises a court trying a criminal case, in the interests of justice, to direct the accused person appearing before it, to give his sample writing for comparison. In the interest of justice, the court can direct an accused person appearing before it, to give his sample writing to enabling the same to be compared by a handwriting expert approved by the court, with any disputed writing by the accused.76 Section 94(1) , Cr.P.C., of the old code, orS. 91 of the new code, authorises a court, or an officer in charge of a police station, to issue a written order to the person having possession of the document to produce the same. The Supreme Court held by a majority in State of Gujarat v. Syamlal Mohanlal Choksi77 that under this provision, an accused person cannot be asked to produce documents in his possession. One of the considerations before the Court to reach this conclusion was that under the Kalu Oghad ruling, an accused person cannot be compelled to disclose documents which are incriminatory and based on his Page 1221 knowledge. But the language of S. 94 being general, any document can be called under it. \"If s. 94 is construed to include an accused person, some unfortunate consequences could follow\". In the instant case, the respondent, a money lender, was prosecuted under the Money Lenders' Act for not keeping proper accounts. The prosecutor applied to the magistrate to direct the accused to produce the accounts but the court refused to do so keeping in view Art. 20(3). Ultimately, the matter came before the Supreme Court by way of appeal from the High Court and the Supreme Courtagreed with the magistrate's ruling holding that S. 94 , Cr.P.C, does not cover an accused person. Article 20(3) is not violated when an accused is compelled to stand up and show his face for the purpose of identification, for it does not amount to giving of testimony as the physical facts which are noticed speak for themselves.78 When the accused was taken to the doctor for medical examination to determine whether he was intoxicated or not, and the doctor recorded his observations of the physical features and other symptoms exhibited by the accused, and he was not compelled to give any evidence, the High Court held that the symptoms observed by the doctor could not be regarded as evidence obtained from the accused by compulsion.79 Compulsory taking of urine and blood samples from an accused is not hit by Art. 20(3) as it is not testimonial compulsion.80 During the course of investigation of a crime by the police, if an accused person were to point out the place where the corpus delicti was lying concealed, and in pursuance of such information the discovery was made within the meaning of S. 27 of the Evidence Act, such information and the discovery made as a result thereof may be proved in evidence even though it may tend to incriminate the person giving the information while in police custody, unless compulsion has been used in obtaining the information. Section 27 of the Evidence Act has been held to fall outside the prohibition of Art. 20(3),81 unless compulsion has been used in obtaining the information.",

If the self-incriminatory information has been given by an accused person without any threat, that will be admissible in evidence and will not be hit by Art. 20(3).82 Admission of tape-recorded evidence against the accused does not violate Art. 20(3) when the conversation on his part was voluntary and there was no compulsion. The fact that the attaching of the tape recording instrument was unknown to the accused would not render the evidence of conversation inadmissible. The accused person's conversation is not extracted under duress or compulsion. Recording of conversation on tape was \"a mechanical contrivance to play the role of an eavesdropper.\"83 With the advancement of technology, methods of investigation are now available to the police and other investigative authorities which have and continue to raise interesting issues on the constitutionality of the processes employed. Recently the Bombay High Court84 considered whether the compulsory subjection of accused to three of these new methods namely Lie Detector or polygraphy tests, P-300 Test or Brain Mapping tests and Narco Analysis or Truth Serum Tests violate the constitutional prohibition of testimonial compulsion under Art. 20(3). According to the court none of the tests violated Art. 20(3) because \"The tests of Brain Mapping and Lie Detector in which the map of the brain is the result, or polygraph, ... cannot be said to be a statement made by the witness. At the most it can be called the information received or taken out from the witness\". With regard to narco analysis while holding that the result of administration of serum is necessarily a statement nevertheless \"unless it is shown to be incriminating to a person making it, it does not give rise to the protection under Article 20(3)\". Several High Courts have taken similar views85 and the issue is now pending before the Supreme Court. (e) WHAT IS COMPULSION In order to bring the evidence within the inhibition of Art. 20(3), it must be shown that not only the person making the statement was an accused at the time of making the statement86 and that it had a material bearing on the criminality of the maker of the statement, but also that he was compelled to make the statement. Page 1222 'Compulsion' is duress; compulsion has to be a physical objective act and not the state of mind of the person making the statement, except where the mind has been so conditioned by some extraneous process as to render the making of the statement involuntary and, therefore, extorted. The mere asking by a police officer investigating a crime against a certain individual to do a certain thing is not compulsion within the meaning of Art. 20(3). The mere fact that the accused was in police custody at the time he made the statement would not, by itself, be the foundation for the inference of law that the accused was compelled to make the statement. An accused person is not regarded as having been compelled to be a witness against himself merely because he made a statement while in police custody without anything more. As a proposition of law, the mere fact of being in police custody at the time of making the statement does not by itself lead to the inference that the accused has been compelled to make the statement.87 However, if the police obtains the statement by employing third degree methods, the statement would be barred under Art. 20(3).88 The accused may, however, show that while he was in police custody at the relevant time, he was subjected to treatment which amounted to compulsion. In other words, it will be a question of fact in each case to be determined by the court on weighing the facts and circumstances disclosed in the evidence before it.89 Compulsion may take many forms; an accused may be subjected to physical or mental torture; he may be starved or beaten and a confession extorted from him. In Nandini Satpathy,90 Iyer, J., advocated an expansive interpretation of the phrase 'compelled testimony'. According to him, it is evidence procured \"not merely by physical threats or violence\" but also \"by psychic torture, atmospheric pressure, environmental coercion, tiring interrogative prolixity, over-bearing and intimidatory methods, and the like\". Any mode of pressure, \"subtle or crude, mental or physical, direct or indirect, but sufficiently substantial\", applied by the police to obtain information from an accused strongly suggestive of guilt becomes compulsion. However, legal perils following upon refusal to answer, or answer truthfully, do not amount to compulsion within Art. 20(3). But \"frequent threats of prosecution if there is failure to answer may take on the complexion of undue pressure\" violating Art. 20(3). These guidelines have been statutorily incorporated into Sections 32 and 52 of POTA 91. The peremptory prescriptions embodied in Section 32 of POTA are: (a) The police officer shall warn the accused that he is not bound to make the confession and if he does so, it may be used against him [vide sub-section (2)]. (b) The confession shall be recorded in an atmosphere free from threat or inducement and shall be in the same language in which the person makes it [vide sub-section (3)]. Although Art. 20(3) does not in terms apply to the pre-trial stage, Nandini Satpathy's case sought to introduce it by way of interpretation relying upon the landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in Miranda v. Arizona1 which requires the police officer to inform the person arrested of his right to consult a legal practitioner immediately upon arrest.",

    "content": "Art. 20(3) does not in terms apply to the pre-trial stage, Nandini Satpathy's case sought to introduce it by way of interpretation relying upon the landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in Miranda v. Arizona1 which requires the police officer to inform the person arrested of his right to consult a legal practitioner immediately upon arrest. Section 52(2) of POTA which so provides is founded on the Miranda rule.2 When a trap is laid and the accused talks, then there is no element of duress, coercion or compulsion, and he cannot claim the protection of Art. 20(3) in such a situation.3 Telephonic conversation between two parties was tape-recorded by the police with the permission of one of the parties. The Supreme Court ruled in R.M. Malkani v. State of Maharashtra, 4 that the conversation could be used in evidence as it was voluntary and there was no duress or compulsion to extract the same. The fact that the tape-recording instrument was attached without the appellant's knowledge does not make the conversation inadmissible against him. Further, there was no case against him at the time of the conversation and so there was no scope for holding that he was made to incriminate himself. Article 20(3) is not violated when the accused volunteers evidence against himself. Since the Article gives only a privilege, the accused may waive it if he so likes.5 Page 1223 There are, however, a number of safeguards in the Indian law subject to which oral evidence of the accused can be recorded by the police so that chances of police exerting duress or compulsion against the accused may be minimised. Till 1955, in India, an accused was not a competent witness and could not testify on his behalf even if he wanted to do so. S. 342 A added to the Criminal Procedure Code in 1955 permits the accused to offer himself as a witness. It, however, lays down that the accused's failure to give evidence is not to be the subject of any comment by any party or the court, or is not to give rise to any presumption against him. No adverse inference can thus be drawn from the failure of the accused to testify.6 Under S. 26 of the Evidence Act, no confession made by a person while in police custody is to be proved against him unless it has been made in the immediate presence of a magistrate. A confession by an accused is recorded under S. 164,Cr. P.C., but he later retracts it in the magistrate's court. Can the confession be used against him at the sessions trial? Does Art. 20(3) bar the use of a retracted confession against the accused? TheSupreme Court has ruled that the confession has to be voluntary; a confession made under threat, inducement or compulsion is inadmissible. Art. 20(3) would not apply if confession is made otherwise than under threat, promise or inducement. A retracted confession has little probative value but is not inadmissible under Art. 20(3).7 In Mohd. Dastgir v. State of Madras,8 the accused went to the house of the police officer and offered him some currency notes as bribe which he threw at the face of the accused. Shortly, thereafter, the officer asked the accused to produce the currency notes which he did. The accused was then tried for the offence of offering a bribe. It was argued on behalf of the accused that he was compelled to produce the envelope containing the currency notes and there was thus violation of Art. 20(3). The Supreme Court rejected the contention. The Court argued that before Art. 20(3) could come into play, two facts must be established, viz.: (1) that the individual concerned was a person accused of an offence; and (2) that he was compelled to be a witness against himself. The requirements of Art. 20(3) would not be fulfilled if only one of these facts and not the other is established. The Supreme Court held in the instant case that the accused could not claim the benefit of Art. 20(3) as he was not compelled by the officer to produce the currency notes. Although the accused was asked to produce the money, it was within his power to refuse to comply with the officer's request. The Bombay9, Madras10 and Kerala High Courts11 have held that an accused can be compelled to undergo a narco-analysis or truth serum test and that the question of violation of Art. 20(3) would arise only if as a result of the test the accused makes a statement which is incriminatory and the prosecution seeks to introduce it into evidence. Privilege against self-incrimination has not been applied in India to searches and seizures, or seizure of documents under a search warrant. A search of the premises in possession of a person accused of an offence, under a search warrant, and seizure of documents, under the provisions of Ss. 94and 95, Cr.P.C. (old), or S. 94 , Cr.P.C. (new), is not a compelled production within the meaning of Art. 20(3) and, hence, would not offend that constitutional provision. The reason is that a search warrant is issued to a police officer and so search and seizure cannot be regarded as the acts of the occupier of the premises in question; they are the acts of another to which the occupier is obliged to submit and are, therefore, not his testimonial acts in any sense.12 The Supreme Court has reiterated this view in V.S. Kuttan Pillai v. Ramakrishnan .13 Documents found on the premises can be seized irrespective of the fact that they contain some statements made by the accused upon his personal knowledge and which, when proved, may have the tendency to incriminate him. The immunity against self-incrimination extends to incriminating evidence which the accused may be compelled to give, but not to such situations where incriminating evidence is being collected without in any manner compelling the accused, or asking him to be a party to the collection thereof.",

    "content": "immunity against self-incrimination extends to incriminating evidence which the accused may be compelled to give, but not to such situations where incriminating evidence is being collected without in any manner compelling the accused, or asking him to be a party to the collection thereof. Search and seizure under a search warrant do not have even the remotest tendency to compel the accused to incriminate Page 1224 himself. \"A passive submission to search cannot be styled as a compulsion on the accused and if anything is recovered during such search which may provide incriminating evidence against the accused it cannot be styled as a compelled testimony.\" Section 342 , Cr.P.C., 1898, ors. 313,Cr.P.C., 1973, permits the courts to question the accused generally after witnesses for him have been examined. The court may draw such inference from his refusal or answers as it thinks just. The section does not contravene Art. 20(3) because the answers by the accused can only be taken in consideration at the inquiry and they are not in substitution of the evidence by the prosecution which must make out its case by evidence. The object of the section is not to build up a case against the accused from his answers or non-answers but to test by explanation furnished by him, the truth of the prosecution version. When the answers given by the accused satisfactorily explain the prosecution evidence, there could be no conviction: if they do not rebut the prosecution evidence, he would be convicted. The accused is not in the position of a witness as he does not testify on oath. His statement is not evidence but only a matter which the court can take into consideration, and is not covered by Art. 20(3) which applies to evidence and not to a matter. This may, however, be too narrow a view to take of the constitutional provision which does not use any words to confine its operation only to evidence in the strict sense. The guarantee is against 'testimonial compulsion' which does not appear to be restricted to evidence only.14 Somewhat in line with S. 342 , Cr.P.C., 1898 (s. 313,Cr.P.C. 1973), is S. 124 of the Bombay Police Act which states that whoever has in his possession anything which there is reason to believe is stolen property, shall, if he fails to account for such possession, on conviction, be imprisoned for certain period. The provision has been held not to contravene Art. 20(3) because the accused is to account for his possession only after the prosecution has proved that there is reason to believe that the property in his possession is stolen property.15 A Punjab ordinance provided that on prima facie cause being shown that a person has obtained through some criminal offences some property, the district judge could issue an interim attachment order with regard to the property, and at the same time issue a notice to the person concerned to show cause as to why the interim order should not be made absolute. The provision was held not to contravene Art. 20(3) on the ground that the accused was not compelled to be a witness against himself, since presumably his answer to the notice must be that he was innocent and there could be no objection to his getting on record as early as possible his reasons for saying so.16 Criminal prosecution of the appellant for several offences was imminent. On the same facts, the collector of customs initiated proceedings against him under the Customs Act. It was argued that this violated Art. 20(3) as the appellant would be forced to give evidence and thus incriminate himself. Rejecting the argument, theSupreme Courtsaid: \"He may, if he chooses, not appear as a witness in the proceedings\" under the Customs Act. \"The necessity to enter the witness-box for substantiating his defence is not such a compulsion as would attract the protection of Art. 20(3).\" It may be very necessary for the accused to enter the witness-box for substantiating his defence, but this is no reason for saying that the criminal trial compels him to be a witness against himself in violation of Art. 20(3). \"Compulsion in the context of Art. 20(3) must proceed from another person or authority. The appellant is not compelled to be a witness if he voluntarily gives evidence in his defence.\" In the instant case, the customs authorities gave an undertaking not to use in criminal proceedings any statements which may be made by the appellant during the adjudication proceedings.17S. 132, Evidence Act, could also be invoked to protect him.18 The protection of Art. 20(3) is against the accused to incriminate himself under compulsion. This does not mean that he need not give information regarding matters which do not tend to incriminate him.19 Self-incriminatory testimony falling within the prohibition of Art. 20(3) is to be of such a character that by itself it should have the tendency of incriminating the accused, if not also of actually doing so. \"In other words, it should be a statement which makes the case against the accused person at least probable considered by itself.\"20 Page 1225 Criminal proceedings were launched against the father for kidnapping his child from the lawful custody of the child's mother. Later, a habeas corpus petition was filed by the mother in which he was directed to produce the child in court which he did not. He stated that as he was protected by Art. 20(3), he need not divulge his defence in the criminal case. He was condemned to imprisonment for two months for contempt of court. The Court observed that a criminal prosecution is not a fortress against all other actions in law.21 A husband's claim for protection under Art.",

    "content": "was condemned to imprisonment for two months for contempt of court. The Court observed that a criminal prosecution is not a fortress against all other actions in law.21 A husband's claim for protection under Art. 20(3) for refusing to enter his defence in divorce proceedings because a proceeding under Section 498 -A IPC was pending trial, was negatived on the ground that the first was a civil case and also that the two proceedings are totally independent and their scope and nature are entirely different from each other.22 Under S. 15 of the TADA Act [The Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987], confession made by the accused was made admissible in evidence. The Supreme Court ruled in Ayub v. State of Uttar Pradesh23 that under Art. 20(3), the accused person has a protection from being compelled to be a witness against himself. Therefore, the confession made under S. 15, TADA Act, must be strictly according to the procedure laid down in the Act for recording confession. The confession should appear to have been made voluntarily and the police officer who records the confession should satisfy himself that the same was being made voluntarily by the maker of that statement. The recorded confession must indicate that these safeguards had been fully complied with. Like the TADA Act, 1987 the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002 exclude from their purview the provisions of Sections 24 to 27 of the Evidence Act with regard to confession made before a police officer. In State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu it was said that non compliance with the procedural safeguards against involuntary confessions need not necessarily or automatically lead to the rejection of the confession although \"the breach thereof will normally result in eschewing the confession from consideration\".24 (f) PERSON ACCUSED OF AN OFFENCE The privilege under Art. 20(3) is available not only to an individual, but even to an incorporated body, if \"accused of an offence\".25 In order to avail of the protection of Art. 20(3) against self-incrimination, a condition to be fulfilled is that the person claiming the protection should be one \"accused of an offence\" at the time he makes the statement. Art. 20(3) does not apply if the person is not an accused at the time he makes the statement but becomes an accused by the time when later the statement made by him is sought to be proved. This means a person against whom a formal accusation relating to the commission of an offence has been levelled and although the actual trial may not have commenced as yet, but which in normal course may result in his prosecution. The Supreme Court has stated in Raja Narayanlal:26 \"For invoking the constitutional right against testimonial compulsion guaranteed under Art. 20(3), it must appear that a formal accusation has been made against the party pleading the guarantee and that it relates to the commission of an offence which in the normal course may result in prosecution.\" When, therefore, a person claims the benefit of the privilege, the question has to be asked whether he has been accused of any offence. A person cannot claim the privilege if at the time he made the statement he was not an accused but became an accused thereafter.27 What constitutes a formal accusation is rather flexible. To answer the question whether a person is accused or not at a particular time, it is necessary to make a reference to the nature and scope of the proceedings, the nature of the accusation and its probable consequence.28 Accusing a person of committing a crime in the first information report, or in formal complaint before a magistrate, amounts to a formal accusation and the person concerned can claim the privilege. As the Supreme Court has observed in Guha:29 \"It is well settled that with the lodging of a first information report a person is accused of an offence within the meaning of Art. 20(3).\" Accusation can also be made in any other formal document or notice served on that person which ordinarily results in his prosecution in court.30 Therefore, statements made by a person to the police when he did not stand in the character of a person accused of an offence were not protected by Art. 20(3). It is not enough that he should become an accused any time after he has made a statement. When a person was arrested Page 1226 under S. 6of the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966, but no formal accusation was made against him at the time his statement was recorded, Art. 20(3) would not apply.31 The privilege in Art. 20(3) is undoubtedly available at the trial stage in the court room.32 But it is available even at the pre-trial stage, i.e., during the course of police investigations if the person concerned can be regarded as an accused. In Sharma v. Satish, 33 the Supreme Court has pointed out that there is no reason to think that the protection of Art. 20(3) is confined to what transpires at the trial in a court room. The phrase used in Art. 20(3) is \"to be a witness\" and not to \"appear as a witness\". \"It follows that the protection afforded to an accused in so far as it is related to the phrase 'to be a witness' is not merely in respect of testimonial compulsion in the court room but may well extend to the compelled testimony previously obtained from him. It is available therefore to a person against whom a formal accusation relating to the commission of an offence has been levelled which in the normal course may result in prosecution.\" In Nandini Satpathy v. P.L. Dani,34Nandini Satpathy was directed to appear at the police station for being examined in connection with a case registered against her under the Prevention of Corruption Act.",

P.L. Dani,34Nandini Satpathy was directed to appear at the police station for being examined in connection with a case registered against her under the Prevention of Corruption Act. On the basis of the first information report, investigation was commenced against her and she was interrogated by the police with reference to a long string of questions, but she refused to answer, claiming protection of Art. 20(3). The Supreme Courtheld that S. 160(1) , Cr.P.C., which bars calling of a woman to a police station, was breached in this case. But the Court took opportunity to dilate at length on the scope of Art. 20(3). K. Iyer, J., delivering the Court's decision considered the question whether Art. 20(3) applies only to a person \"accused\", or also to a \"suspect\", who is not formally accused, when the police is holding an investigation against him. The case-law hitherto,viz., Oghad and Maneck Pheroze had held that a suspect was not an accused and so Art. 20(3) would not apply to him. But Krishna Iyer, J., in Nandini expressed a different opinion on this issue. He ruled that Art. 20(3) ought to extend to police investigation also since enquiries under criminal statutes with quasi-criminal investigations are of an accusatory nature and are sure to end in prosecution, if the offence is grave and the evidence gathered is good. To deny the protection of Art. 20(3) to a suspect because the enquiry is preliminary and may possibly not reach the court is to erode the substance. Art. 20(3) is not confined merely to court trial. It extends to \"any compulsory process for production of evidentiary documents which are reasonably likely to support a production against him. Not only compelled testimony previously obtained is excluded but \"the preventive blow falls also on pre-court testimonial compulsion.\" The learned Judge also ruled that the ban on self-accusation and the right to silence, while investigation or trial is underway, goes beyond that case and protects the accused in regard to other offence pending or imminent. \"He is entitled to keep his mouth shut if the answer sought has a reasonable prospect of exposing him to guilt in some other accusation actual or imminent, even though the investigation underway is not with reference to that.\"35 Further, the Judge held that the police must invariably warn, and record the fact, \"about the right to silence against self-incrimination; and where the accused is literate take his written acknowledgement.\" The Court has also stated that the police must inform the accused that he has a right to call a lawyer before answering to any of their questions. But this liberal view of Art. 20(3), expressed by Krishna Iyer, J., in Nandini is nothing more than an obiter for the Judge himself says in this regard: \"We are not directly concerned with this facet of Art. 20(3); nor are we free to go against the settled view of this Court. There it is\". The fact remains that use of third degree methods are common in India during custodial interrogation by the police so much so that custodial deaths are not rare.36 The Law Commission has also referred to this aspect of criminal justice system in India in its paper on \"Custodial Crimes\". To mitigate this evil, the view expressed by K. Iyer, J., in Nandini can be very useful. However, in Kartar Singh v. State of Punjab, 37 the Supreme Court has accepted Krishna Iyer, J's, opinion in Nandini. It has been pointed out that there is a lot of custodial violence and abuse of police power in India. Page 1227 The Court has pointed out that a delicate balance needs to be drawn to protect the innocent from conviction and the need of the society to ensure that the offender is punished. Every one has a right against self-incrimination and a right to be silent under Art. 20(3) which implies his freedom from police or anybody else. The Supreme Court has thus observed in Kartar Singh:38 \"The acts of the person, of course, is neither negative attitude of silence or submission on his part, nor is there any reason to think that the protection in respect of the evidence procured is confined to what transpires at the trial in the court room. The phrase used in Article 20(3) is to be a witness and not to appear as a witness. It follows that the protection accorded to an accused insofar as it is related to the phrase \"to be a witness\" is not merely in respect of the testimonial compulsion in the court room but may well extend to compelled testimony previously obtained from him.\" In Delhi Judicial Service Association v. State of Gujarat,39 the Supreme Court has ruled that mere issue of a notice of contempt of court to a person for pendency of contempt of court proceedings against him, does not attract Art. 20(3) because the contemner against whom the notice is issued is not accused of an offence. Contempt proceeding is sui generis; it has several peculiar features which are not to be found in criminal proceedings. As for instance, a criminal offence is tried according to the procedure laid down in the Criminal Procedure Code, but a contempt charge is tried on summary process without any fixed procedure and the court is free to evolve its own procedure consistent with fairplay and natural justice. The power to take proceedings for contempt of court is an inherent power of a court of record and theCriminal Procedure Code does not apply to such a proceeding.40 Proceedings for contempt of court are of a peculiar nature. Proceedings for contempt of court are not taken in the exercise of original criminal jurisdiction.",

    "content": "power to take proceedings for contempt of court is an inherent power of a court of record and theCriminal Procedure Code does not apply to such a proceeding.40 Proceedings for contempt of court are of a peculiar nature. Proceedings for contempt of court are not taken in the exercise of original criminal jurisdiction. In certain aspects, these proceedings are quasi-criminal, but in any view taken are not exercised as part of the original criminal jurisdiction of the court.41 A contemner is not in the position of an accused. He does not stand in the position of a \"person accused of an offence\" merely on account of issue of notice of contempt by the Supreme Court and, therefore, Art. 20(3) would not apply in such a situation. (g) CIVIL PROCEEDINGS The protection under Art. 20(3) is available only in criminal proceedings or proceedings of criminal nature before a court of law or other tribunal before which a person may be accused of an offence as defined in S. 3(38) of the General Clauses Act, that is, an actpunishable under the Penal Code or a special or local law. A difference of opinion between High Courts on the question whether section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure could be invoked to compel a person to be subject to a medical examination was resolved by theSupreme Court in Sharda v. Dharmpal.42 The Mysore, 43 and Gujarat,44High Courts held that Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure cannot be taken recourse to for the purpose. The High Courts of Calcutta,45 and Andhra Pradesh46 held to the contrary. The Supreme Courtapproved the latter view saying that the court must be held to have the requisite power even under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure to issue such direction \"either suo motu or otherwise which, according to (the court), would lead to the truth\".47 The protection of Art. 20(3) does not therefore extend to parties and witnesses in civil proceedings or proceedings other than criminal.48 (h) ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS Article 20(3) is not applicable to administrative investigations even though the primary aim of these proceedings may be to find out whether the individual has committed an offence or not.49 Under S. Section 45G of the Banking Companies Act, after an order for the winding up of a banking company has been made, the official liquidator has to submit a report whether in his opinion any loss has been caused to the company by any act or omission of the directors, amounting to fraud. After considering the report, the High Court may publicly examine the directors, promoters, auditors, etc. of the company regarding their conduct and dealings in relation to the affairs of the company. In Augusthi,50 the appellant was ordered to appear before the court for examination under section 45G. He Page 1228 challenged section 45G as unconstitutional vis-à-vis Art. 20(3), but the Supreme Court upheld the same. The Supreme Court conceded that under section 45G, a person could be compelled to answer incriminating questions put to him by the High Court, and subsequently even charges might be levelled against the directors, nevertheless, the privilege against self-incrimination would not apply as there was no formal accusation against the directors at that stage. The object of the inquiry thereunder is to collect evidence and decide whether any acts or omissions have caused loss to the company. If as a result of the inquiry, the court comes to the conclusion that acts or omissions did cause loss to the company, then some action might be taken against the persons examined. Thus, an accusation may or may not follow the enquiry, but there is no accusation at the time of the inquiry. The accusation of an offence is a condition precedent for the application of Art. 20(3) and this essential condition is lacking in cases covered by S. Section 45G of the Banking Companies Act because the persons called for public examination undersection 45G are not accused of any offence. Article 20(3) is not violated even when the liquidator accuses the directors of fraud in his report, and thereupon the court decides to hold the enquiry under S. 45G, as the official liquidator's report does not amount to an accusation within Art. 20(3).51 In such a proceeding, a person cannot refuse to give an answer on the plea that it might tend to subject him to a criminal prosecution at a future date. In Raja Narayanlal Bansilal v. Maneck Firoz Mistry, 52 the Registrar in his report to the Central Government [made under S. 137(5)of the Companies Act, 1913] alleged that the business of the company was being carried on in fraud of the contributories. The Government appointed an inspector to investigate into the affairs of the company. He issued notices to the appellants to attend his office for being examined on oath in relation to the affairs of the company (as provided in Ss. 239 and 240 of the Companies Act, 1956). The appellant claimed the privilege against self-incrimination under Art. 20(3) on the ground that the main object of the investigation was to discover whether he had committed any offence or not. Denying that the appellant could claim any immunity under Art. 20(3), the Supreme Court pointed out that the privilege was available to an accused person only, and as no formal accusation was laid against the appellant, he could not claim the privilege. The enquiry was in substance \"an inquiry into the affairs of the company concerned\"; that \"the investigation carried on by the inspectors is no more than the work of a fact-finding commission,\" and that the investigation begins broadly with a view to examine the management of the company to find out whether any irregularities have been committed or not\". At no stage in the inquiry, there is any accused person or accuser or accusation against any one that he has committed an offence.",

    "content": "no stage in the inquiry, there is any accused person or accuser or accusation against any one that he has committed an offence. The commission of offences might be discovered as a result of the inquiry and then the government may institute criminal proceedings against the offending persons but the fact that a prosecution may ultimately be launched would not retrospectively change the complexion of the proceedings held by the inspector. The Registrar's report could hardly amount to an accusation against the appellants as it was \"only intended to enable the Central Government to decide whether it should appoint an inspector\". At the investigation before the inspector, the Registrar was not the complainant making an accusation against the appellant; the function of the investigation was not to find out whether the said accusation was proved or not. Proceedings held before the customs authorities under S. Section 171A of the Sea Customs Act for confiscation of goods and imposition of a penalty on the ground of smuggling of goods do not fall within the purview of Art. 20(3). Even when the customs officer arrests a person suspected of smuggling, he is not an accused within Art. 20(3) and a confession obtained from him is not hit by Art. 20(3). These proceedings are not under the criminal law; there is no accusation and only departmental penalties could be imposed. The only concern of the customs officer is to prevent smuggling and recover customs duties. Even if the customs officer arrests a person on suspicion of his having infringed a provision of the Customs Act, and holds an inquiry after informing the person of the cause of his arrest [ Art. 22(1)],53 the person concerned is not one accused of a crime. It is only when a complaint is lodged against him before a magistrate that the person becomes an accused. Page 1229 In Romesh,54the appellant was searched at the Calcutta Airport. As a consequence, currency, pearls and jewellery were found on his person and in his baggage. He was charged under the Sea Customs Act. During his trial, reliance was placed on his confessional statement made by him before the Customs Authorities. It was argued that it was inadmissible in evidence because of Art. 20(3). Rejecting the objection, the Court ruled that the guarantee against testimonial compulsion contained in Art. 20(3) can be claimed by a person only if he was accused of an offence at the time he made the statement. Under the Sea Customs Act, the Custom Officer does not accuse a person of any offence when he calls upon a person smuggling goods to make a statement. The officer holds the inquiry with a view to adjudge confiscation of goods dutiable or prohibited and imposing penalties. His primary duty is to prevent smuggling; he is not accusing any person of any offence triable before a magistrate. More recently the court has reiterated that during an inquiry under the Customs Act or under the NDPSAct the person concerned is not an accused although he may be said to be in custody. Any statement made by the accused at such a time when he was not under arrest, would not attract the bar under Sections 24 to 27 of the Evidence Act nor the provisions of Article 20(3).55 Despite earlier pronouncements, Art. 20(3) was relied upon to stay prosecution under Sections 277 and 278 of the Income Tax Act on the ground that the accused (who was charged with misappropriation of funds of the Animal Husbandry Department and of fraudulent withdrawals from the State exchequer by issuing fake bills for supplies never made to the Animal Husbandry Department), had been granted a pardon underSection 306 of the Criminal Procedure Code by the Special Judge, CBI, on the condition that he makes a full and complete disclosure. The court was persuaded to extend the benefits of Art. 20(3) to Income Tax proceedings perhaps to ensure a full and complete disclosure in the \"Fodder scam\" case.56 In Illias v. Collector of Customs,57it has been held that the customs officers are not police officers and any statement recorded by them under Ss. 107 and 108, Customs Act, is not inadmissible in evidence. Since it has been held by Courts that an officer for the purposes of Section 67 read with 42 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, is not a police officer, the statement made by a person directed to appear before the officer concerned may be relied upon as a confessional statement against such person.58 A person was arrested under S. Section 19B of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act and the grounds of arrest served on him included the accusation relating to a transaction with reference to which he was summoned before the Enforcement Directorate to give evidence. The petitioner pointed out that he was accused at the time of his arrest of having committed an offence which was the subject-matter of the inquiry and, therefore, the summons against him should be withdrawn. The Director rejected the request and asserted that the appellant must comply the same. On the above facts, the Supreme Court considered the matter and ruled that the First Information Report had been lodged earlier in the case, and with the lodging of the FIR, a person is accused of an offence within the meaning of Art. 20(3). Accordingly, the appellant was held entitled to partial relief. The Court emphasized that the only protection given by Art. 20(3) to a person accused of an offence is that he cannot be compelled to be a witness against himself. But, this does not mean that he need not give information regarding matters which do not tend to incriminate him. The Court directed the appellant to appear before the Directorate to answer such questions as would not tend to incriminate him. The Court clarified that permitting him not to answer self-incriminating questions was because he was an accused on the relevant date.",

    "content": "Court directed the appellant to appear before the Directorate to answer such questions as would not tend to incriminate him. The Court clarified that permitting him not to answer self-incriminating questions was because he was an accused on the relevant date. There was a difference of opinion among the High Courts on the question whether persons are entitled to the presence of their lawyers when they are being questioned during investigation under the Customs Act, or the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA). The argument was that in a situation where there exists the possibility of the person under interrogation being prosecuted as an accused, he would be entitled to the assistance of a lawyer during the questioning, because to deny him such a right would be violative of Art. 20(3). In Poolandi v. Superintendent, Central Excise, 59 the Supreme Court has now answered the question in the Page 1230 negative. The Court has again explained the scope of Art. 20(3) which embodies a guarantee against self-incrimination. It is an established proposition that the guarantee against self-incrimination can be claimed only by a person who is accused of an offence at the time he is compelled to make the incriminating statement. \"It does not refer to the hypothetical person who may in the future be discovered to have been guilty of some offence.\" The broad operation given to Art. 20(3) in the Nandini Satpathy case60 with reference to criminal offences was not acceptable to the Court in the instant case and the Court preferred to follow its ruling in Ramesh Chandra Mehta v. State of West Bengal61 and Illias v. Collector of Customs, 62both cases under the Customs Act, but both were pre-Nandini Satpathy cases. The Court also rejected the argument that to call a person away from the comforts and convenience of his home to the customs office and to question him there without the assistance of a lawyer amounts to mental torture which violates Art. 21. The Court stated:63 \"The purpose of the inquiry under the Customs Act and the other similar statutes will be completely frustrated if the whims of the persons in possession of useful information for the departments are allowed to prevail. For achieving the object of such an enquiry if the appropriate authorities be of the view that such persons should be dissociated from the atmosphere and the company of persons who provide encouragement to them in adopting a non-co-operative attitude to the machineries of law, there cannot be any legitimate objection in depriving them of such company. The relevant provisions of the Constitution in this regard have to be construed in the spirit they were made and the benefits thereunder should not be 'expanded' to favour exploiters engaged in tax evasion at the cost of public exchequer. Applying the 'just, fair and reasonable test' we hold that there is no merit in the stand of the appellant before us.\" It seems that the Court has adopted a more stringent attitude in respect of economic offences than ordinary criminal offences. Also, the Court distinguishes between proceedings under the Criminal Procedure Code and administrative investigatory proceedings. Only on that basis can be explained the Court's refusal to follow the dicta inNandini Satpathy.64 From the above, it becomes clear that the immunity under Art. 20(3) cannot be claimed by a person in proceedings before administrative bodies on the narrow ground that there is no criminal accusation against him. This is the result of the Supreme Court interpreting the word \"accused\" in Art. 20(3) as a person \"formally accused of an offence\". This approach very much restricts the effectiveness of the immunity in Art. 20(3) in these days of proliferation of adjudicatory bodies outside the regular hierarchy of courts. The aim of administrative investigations is not only to find out facts, but also to collect evidence on which a prosecution may be based later. As for example, in the Maneck Phiroze case, the inspector making the investigation was told to bear in mind that \"for a successful prosecution the evidence in support of a charge must be clear, tangible and cogent\". The obvious implications of this direction were that he should fish out evidence against the persons concerned which may be of probative value in criminal proceedings to be launched subsequently. This means that what cannot be achieved through a formal criminal proceeding can be easily achieved through administrative proceedings and evidence thus collected can be used against the person concerned when formally prosecuted later in a criminal court. From this point of view, the privilege against self-incrimination loses much of its efficacy in this era of growth of administrative process. 1.

The Fundamental Rights under Art. 19 are conferred only on citizens,1 but the rights mentioned in (a) to (f) above are available to all persons whether citizens or not. In a number of cases, the Supreme Court has held that foreigners are entitled to the protection of Arts. 21 and 22.2 On the question of applicability of Art. 21 to non-citizens, the Supreme Court has emphasized that even those who come to India as tourists also \"have the right to live, so long as they are here, with human dignity, just as the State is under an obligation to protect the life of every citizen in this country, so also the State is under an obligation to protect the life of the persons who are not citizens.\"3 B. PROTECTION OF LIFE AND PERSONAL LIBERTY: ART. 21 (a) GOPALAN : 1950 Article 21 lays down that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to 'procedure established by law'. The most important words in this provision are procedure established by law. Immediately after the Constitution became effective, the question of interpretation of these words arose in the famous Gopalan case4 where the validity of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950, was challenged.5 The main question was whether Art. 21 envisaged any procedure laid down by a law enacted by a legislature, or whether the procedure should be fair and reasonable. On behalf of Gopalan, an attempt was made to persuade the Supreme Courtto hold that the Courts could adjudicate upon the reasonableness of the Preventive Detention Act, or for that matter, any law depriving a person of his personal liberty. A three pronged argument was developed for this purpose: Page 1237 (1) The word 'law' in Art. 21 does not mean merely enacted law but incorporates principles of natural justice so that a law to deprive a person of his life or personal liberty cannot be valid unless it incorporates these principles in the procedure laid down by it.6 (2) The reasonableness of the law of preventive detention ought to be judged under Art. 19.7 (3) The expression 'procedure established by law' introduces into India the American concept of procedural due process which enables the Courts to see whether the law fulfils the requisite elements of a reasonable procedure. Thus, in Gopalan, an attempt was made to win for a detenu better procedural safeguards than were available to him under the relevant detention law and Art. 22.8 But the attempt failed as the Supreme Court rejected all these arguments. (b) NATURAL JUSTICE The Supreme Court ruled by majority that the word 'law' in Art. 21 could not be read as meaning rules of natural justice. These rules were vague and indefinite and the Constitution could not be read as laying down a vague standard. Nowhere in the Constitution the word 'law' was used in the sense of abstract law or natural justice. The word 'law' was used in the sense of lex (state-made law) and not jus. The expression 'procedure established by law' would therefore mean the procedure as laid down in an enacted law. On the other hand, Fazl Ali, J., disagreeing with the majority view, held that the principle of natural justice that 'no one shall be condemned unheard' was part of the general law of the land and the same should accordingly be read into Art. 21. (c) RELATION BETWEEN ARTS. 21, 22 AND 19 An attempt was made by the petitioner in Gopalan to establish a link between these three Articles.9 The underlying purpose was to persuade the Court to adjudge the reasonableness of the Preventive Detention Act. It was, therefore, argued that when a person was detained, his several rights under Art. 19 [except the right to hold property under Art. 19(1)(f)] were affected and, thus, the reasonableness of the law, and the procedure contained therein, should be justiciable with reference to Arts. 19(2) to (6). Rejecting the argument, the Court pointed out that the word 'personal liberty' in Art. 21 in itself had a comprehensive content and, ordinarily, if left alone, would include not only freedom from arrest or detention, but also various freedoms guaranteed by Art. 19. However, reading Arts. 19 and 21 together, Art. 19 must be held to deal with a few specific freedoms mentioned therein and not with freedom from detention whether punitive or preventive. Similarly, Art. 21 should be held as excluding the freedoms dealt with in Art. 19. The Court ruled that Arts. 20 to 22 constituted a comprehensive code and embodied the entire constitutional protection in relation to life and personal liberty and was not controlled by Art. 19. Thus, a law depriving personal liberty had to conform with Arts. 20 to 22 and not with Art. 19, which covered a separate and distinct ground. Art. 19 could be invoked only by a freeman and not one under arrest. Further, Art. 19 could be invoked only when a law directly attempted to control a right mentioned therein. Therefore, a law directly controlling a citizen's freedom of speech could be tested under Art. 19(2). But Art. 19 could not be invoked when a law not directly in respect of a right mentioned therein infringed a right guaranteed by Art. 19. This judicial approach means that a preventive detention law would be valid, and be within the terms of Art. 21, so long as it conformed with Art. 22, and it would not be required to meet the challenge of Art. 19. On the other hand, azl Ali, J. differing with the majority, held that Art. 19(1)(d) did control Arts. 21 and 22, because juridically freedom of movement was an essential requisite of personal liberty, and, therefore, the reasonableness of the Preventive Detention Act should be justiciable under Art. 19(5).",

Page 1238 (d) DUE PROCESS OF LAW The V Amendment of the U.S. Constitution lays down inter alia that \"no person shall be deprived of his life, liberty or property, without due process of law\". This clause known as the due process clause, has been the most significant single source of judicial review in the U.S.A. The word 'due' in this clause is interpreted to mean 'just', 'proper' or 'reasonable', according to the judicial view. Therefore, the Courts can pronounce whether a law affecting a person's life, liberty or property is reasonable or not. The Court may declare a law invalid if it does not accord with its notions of what is just and fair in the circumstances. Due process has two aspects. Substantive due process envisages that the substantive provisions of a law should be reasonable and not arbitrary. Procedural due process envisages a reasonable procedure, i.e., the person affected should have fair right of hearing which includes four elements; (i) notice, (ii) opportunity to be heard, (iii) an impartial tribunal and (iv) an orderly procedure. Under the concept of 'due process', the Courts become the arbiter of reasonableness of both substantive as well as procedural provisions in a law. The word 'due' is of variable content in the 'due process' concept. It denotes that the law should be 'just' but what is 'just and reasonable' is not a static or rigid concept; it varies from situation to situation, and what may be regarded as reasonable in one situation may not necessarily be so in another situation.10 The 'due process' clause has been used by the U.S. Supreme Court to extend both procedural and substantive safeguards to \"Life, liberty and property\". It was contended in Gopalan that the expression 'procedure established by law' in Art. 21 was synonymous with the American concept of 'procedural due process' and, therefore, the reasonableness of the Preventive Detention Act, or for that matter, of any law affecting a person's life or personal liberty, should be justiciable in order to assess whether the person affected was given a right of fair hearing. The Supreme Court rejected the contention giving several reasons: First, the word 'due' was absent in Art. 21. This was a very significant omission for the entire efficacy of the procedural due process concept emanates from the word 'due'. Secondly, the draft constitution had contained the words 'due process of law' but these words were later dropped and the present phraseology adopted instead.11 This was strong evidence to show that the Constituent Assembly did not desire to introduce into India the concept of procedural due process. This was done mainly to avoid the uncertainty surrounding the due process concept in the U.S.A. The judicial decisions in the U.S.A. on what was reasonable had not been uniform. The concept of 'reasonable' had varied from judge to judge, statute to statute, time to time and subject to subject. Thirdly, the American doctrine generated the countervailing, but complicated, doctrine of police power to restrict the ambit of due process, i.e., the doctrine of governmental power to regulate private rights in public interest.12 If the doctrine of due process were imported into India then the doctrine of police power might also have to be imported which would make things very complicated. However, Fazl Ali, J., disagreed with the majority view on this point as well. He interpreted the phrase 'procedure established by law' in Art. 21 as implying 'procedural due process', meaning thereby that no person could be condemned unheard, a principle well recognised in all modern civilized legal systems. Thus, the Supreme Court ruled in Gopalan that in Art. 21, the expression \"Procedure established by law\" meant the procedure as laid down in the law as enacted by the Legislature and nothing more. A person could thus be deprived of his \"life\" or 'personal liberty' in accordance with the procedure laid down in the relevant law. Page 1239 The Court was thus concerned with the procedure as laid down in the statute. Whether the procedure was fair or reasonable, or according to natural justice or not was not the concern of the Court. The ruling thus meant that to deprive a person of his life or personal liberty-- (1) there must be a law; (2) it should lay down a procedure; and (3) the executive should follow this procedure while depriving a person of his life or personal liberty. The way the majority handled Art. 21 in Gopalan was not free from criticism. Gopalan was characterised as the 'high-water mark of legal positivism'. Court's approach was very static, mechanical, purely literal and was too much coloured by the positivist or imperative theory of law.13 The Court treated the Constitution as merely another statute. The way Art. 21 was interpreted by the majority in Gopalan meant that Art. 21 constituted a restriction only on the executive which could not act without law and that Art. 21 was impotent against legislative power which could make any law, howsoever drastic, to impose restraints on personal liberty without being obligated to lay down any reasonable procedure for the purpose. It was not for the Court to judge whether the law provided for fair or reasonable procedure or not. Some of the arguments adopted by the majority in Gopalan, to reach the result cannot stand close scrutiny. For instance, the concept of natural justice decried by the Court as vague and uncertain, is very well known in India.",

    "content": "of the arguments adopted by the majority in Gopalan, to reach the result cannot stand close scrutiny. For instance, the concept of natural justice decried by the Court as vague and uncertain, is very well known in India. Since Gopalan, the concept of natural justice has been applied by the Courts in a number of cases and its area of application has expanded by leaps and bounds with the lapse of time.14 Then, the majority in Gopalan characterised the concept of due process as vague and variable. The fact however remains that the Indian Constitution itself incorporates the very same concept to some extent in Art. 19 in the form of 'reasonableness' of restrictions imposed on the rights guaranteed by Art. 19(1).15 The argument that 'due process' and 'police power' concepts go together in reality applies only to 'substantive due process' and not to 'procedural due process' and it was the latter, not the former, which was sought to be imported in Art. 21. There is not much vagueness about the essentials of procedural due process because it basically means \"fair hearing\", which is a very well known concept.14 There may arise variations in the application of this concept to concrete factual situations but this is inevitable in any legal system. The Court has applied the concept of fair hearing in multitude of cases and recognises that this is a flexible and not a rigid concept. The concept of fair hearing is ingrained in the jurisprudence of any civilized country and it does not have to depend for its efficacy on any term like due process. The Supreme Court could have interpreted Art. 21 somewhat liberally and purposefully and implied natural justice therein as they have done in many other situations16. In this connection, reference may be made to a war-time American case, Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath,17 where the Supreme Court construed the term 'statute' as including the broader concept of 'law' and thus extended procedural safeguards to an alien in deportation proceedings. On the same analogy, the word 'law' in Art. 21 could have been construed somewhat broadly than mere 'enacted law' so as to lay down that the right of fair hearing to the person being deprived of his personal liberty was an essential element of 'law' in Art. 21 and that no law denying this basic and elementary right to the individual would be valid. This would have imposed some restraint on the legislature to make a law affecting an individual's personal liberty. Fazl Ali, J., in his minority opinion had taken a much more liberal view of Art. 21. It took nearly three decades for his views to be vindicated in Maneka Gandhi. C. GOPALAN TO MANEKA : 1950-1977 Gopalan held the field for almost three decades., i.e. 1950 to 1978. Gopalan settled two major points in Page 1240 relation to Art. 21. One, Arts. 19, 21 and 22 were mutually exclusive and independent of each other and that Art. 19 was not to apply to a law affecting personal liberty to which Art. 21 would apply. Two, a 'law' affecting life or personal liberty could not be declared unconstitutional merely because it lacked natural justice or due procedure. The legislature was free to lay down any procedure for this purpose. As interpreted in Gopalan, Art. 21 provided no protection or immunity against competent legislative action. Art. 21 gave a carte blanche to a legislature to enact a law to provide for arrest of a person without much procedural safeguard. It gave final say to the legislature to determine what was going to be the procedure to curtail the personal liberty of a person in a given situation and what procedural safeguards he would enjoy. Because of the impotence of Art. 21 as a protection against legislative action, it may not be correct to assume that the constitutional provision was of no value. Art. 21 served as a restraint upon the executive which could not proceed against an individual to curtail his personal liberty save within the four corners of the law. It resulted in several postulates. As for example, a person could not be deprived of his life or personal liberty merely by an executive fiat without there being a valid law to support it.18 To arrest a person for doing an act made penal by an unconstitutional statute would not be in accordance with the procedure established by law. The Courts insisted time and again that while depriving a person of his personal liberty, the procedure established by law must be strictly complied with and must not be departed from to the disadvantage of the person affected.19 In quite a few cases, Courts held the arrest or detention of the petitioner unlawful as not being strictly in accordance with the law.20 In the area of preventive detention, the Courts introduced some elements of Administrative Law with a view to control somewhat the executive power to order preventive detention.21 Thus, Art. 21 provided a safeguard against arbitrary or despotic executive action. Its chief value lay in that a person whose life or personal liberty had been put in jeopardy otherwise than in accordance with the procedure established by law, could immediately take recourse to Art. 226 or 32. In this way, a person whose personal liberty had been curtailed contrary to law was assured of an effective and expeditious remedy. Violation of personal liberty by private individual was not within the purview of Art. 21, and in such a situation remedy was to be sought under the ordinary law and not under Art. 21.22 (a) RELATION BETWEEN ARTS. 19, 21 AND 22 In Gopalan, the Supreme Court had delinked Art. 19 from Arts. 21 and 22. This view held the field for quite some time. At times, this view even led to anomalous results. For example, in Ram Singh v. Delhi,23a person was detained under the Preventive Detention Act for making speeches prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. At this time, Art.",

Delhi,23a person was detained under the Preventive Detention Act for making speeches prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. At this time, Art. 19(2) did not contain the expression 'public order' and so the freedom of speech could not be controlled for that purpose, but a preventive detention order, a much more drastic restriction on the person concerned, could be passed on that basis. The Supreme Court refused to assess the validity of the detention order with reference to Art. 19(1)(a) read with Art. 19(2) stating that even if a right under Art. 19(1)(a) was abridged, the validity of the preventive detention order could not be considered with reference to Art. 19(2) because of the Gopalan ruling that legislation authorising deprivation of personal liberty did not fall under Art. 19, and its validity was not to be judged by the criteria in Art. 19. The validity of such a law depended on its compliance with Arts. 21 and 22. The Court stated that if this led to an anomaly, it was inherent in the structure and language of the relevant constitutional provisions. In course of time, this rigid judicial view came to be softened somewhat. The beginning of the new trend is to be found in the Bank Nationalization case24 decided in 1970. Prior to this case, Arts. 19(1)(f) and 31(2) were regarded as unrelated and mutually exclusive on the analogy of the Gopalan view.25 In the Bank Nationalization case, Art. 19(1)(f) was applied to a law enacted under Art. 31(2). This was the period when the Supreme Court was more solicitous to protect the right to property than the right to personal freedom. Since Art. 31(2) had been drastically amended to dilute protection to property26, the Court now established a link between Art. 19(1)(f) and Art. 31(2) to provide some protection to private property. This case was the precursor of the trend to link Arts. 19, 21 and 22. After Bank Nationalisation, it could be Page 1241 legitimately argued that if Art. 19(1)(f) was linked with Art. 31(2), then there was no reason why Art. 19 could not be linked with Arts. 21 and 22. The Supreme Court recognised the force of this logic when it declared in Sambhu Sarkar27 that the approach of the Court in the Bank Nationalization case had held the major premise of the majority in Gopalan to be incorrect. In another major development from this point of view, in the Bennett Coleman case,28 the Court overruled the argument that Art. 19(1)(a) could not apply to a law affecting freedom of speech but not enacted directly with respect to Art. 19(1)(a). The Court declared that if a law affected freedom of speech, its reasonableness became assessable with reference to Art. 19(2) even though it was not enacted directly to control the freedom of speech. This completely knocked out the Court's earlier argument in Gopalan that Art. 19 applied only when a law was passed directly in respect of a matter falling under it, and not when a law not directly in respect of a right under Art. 19, though it abridged such a right. The Court had emphasized in Gopalan that the question was only to consider the 'directness' of legislation and not what would be the result of the law on a right under Art. 19. Therefore, even though preventive detention deprived a person of the several rights under Art. 19, the validity thereof could not be adjudged under Art. 19. This view was no longer tenable after Bennett Coleman. At last, the Supreme Court moved to link Arts. 19, 21 and 22 in West Bengal v. Ashok Dey .29 It held the West Bengal law of preventive detention valid with reference to Art. 19(1)(d) because in the disturbed law and order situation prevailing in the State, the law was enacted in the interest of the general public. In Haradhan Saha v. State of West Bengal, 30 the Court reviewing the reasonableness of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971 [MISA], with reference to Art. 19, held that it did not suffer from any constitutional infirmity. The Court noted that under the Act grounds of detention were to be supplied to the detenu: the detenu had a right to make a representation which was to be considered by the government as well as by an advisory board, the composition of which conformed with the fundamentals of fair play.31 There was no unreasonableness in the procedure under the Act. Moreover, Art. 22 itself lays down substantive limitations as well as procedural safeguards regarding preventive detention. The principles of natural justice in so far as these are compatible with the detention law did find place in Art. 22 and MISA. The Court also rejected the argument that the discretionary power conferred on administrative authority to order preventive detention under MISA infringed either Art. 19 or Art. 14. The order of preventive detention is qualitatively different from punitive detention. Preventive detention and prosecution are not synonymous. The purposes, authorities and nature of proceedings of the two are different. In a prosecution, an accused is punished for a past act. In preventive detention, the past act is merely the material for inference about the future course of probable conduct on the part of the detenu. Thus, in Khudiram32, Bhagwati, J., asserted: \"It is not open to any one now to contend that a law of preventive detention, which falls within Art. 22, does not have to meet the requirement of Art. 14 or Art. 19.\" Another challenge was mounted to MISA on the ground that conferment of drastic discretionary power of preventive detention, which infringed personal liberty, on the district magistrate, who was not a very high official, violated Art. 19.",

    "content": "does not have to meet the requirement of Art. 14 or Art. 19.\" Another challenge was mounted to MISA on the ground that conferment of drastic discretionary power of preventive detention, which infringed personal liberty, on the district magistrate, who was not a very high official, violated Art. 19. Rejecting the contention in John Martin v. State of West Bengal33, the Court stated that the district magistrate was the head of the district administration, and was in charge of maintaining law and order and essential supplies and services within the district. Further, the exercise of power to order preventive detention was subject to the supervisory control of the State Government; the detention order issued by the district magistrate was subject to the government's approval. Therefore, conferment of power on the district magistrate was not an unreasonable restriction on the right of personal liberty of a citizen under Art. 19. The constitutional significance of these pronouncements should not be minimised. Although the constitutionality of MISA was upheld in these cases with reference to Art. 19, both on substantive as well as procedural grounds, yet the position in essence was now very different from Gopalan. It is one thing to say, as was said in Gopalan, that Art. 19 did not apply to a law restricting personal liberty, but quite another to apply Art. 19 to such a law and then find it to be reasonable. In the latter situation, the final word regarding reasonableness of a law affecting personal liberty rests with the Courts and not with the legislature. Page 1242 Mention may also be made here of P.L. Lakhanpal v. Union of India,34 where the Supreme Court again departed from the strict Gopalan view. This was a case of preventive detention under the Defence of India Rules during the emergency when the normal safeguards provided by Art. 22 were not available.35 There was however a provision for review of detention cases every six months. The Court ruled that although the making of the initial detention order was an exercise of administrative power, the review was a quasi-judicial function and, therefore, the detenu should have been given a right of representation at that stage. Failure to give such a right vitiated the detention of the petitioner. Such a judicial view meant that while lack of natural justice in the law would not make it invalid, nevertheless, the Court could still impose natural justice by its interpretative process. If a law did not lay down a satisfactory procedure, the Court could bring in natural justice and assess the validity of the administrative action infringing personal liberty on that basis. This did tone down somewhat the rigorous statutory approach to Art. 21 as depicted in Gopalan. D. MANEKA GANDHI: THE NEW APPROACH Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India36 is a landmark case of the post-emergency period. This case shows how liberal tendencies have influenced the Supreme Court in the matter of interpreting Fundamental Rights, particularly, Art. 21. A great transformation has come about in the judicial attitude towards the protection of personal liberty after the traumatic experiences of the emergency during 1975-77 when personal liberty had reached its nadir,37 as became clear from the Supreme Court pronouncement in Shukla.38 This case showed that Art. 21 as interpreted in Gopalan could not play any role in providing any protection against any harsh law seeking to deprive a person of his life or personal liberty. It is the dissent of Fazal Ali J which is vindicated in the law subsequently developed by the Supreme Court culminating in Maneka.39 For example, in 2009 the court has held that fairness, justice and reasonableness constitute the essence of guarantee of life and liberty epitomized in Art. 21 of the Constitution and also pervades the sentencing policy in Section 235(2), 354(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code which virtually assimilates the concept of \"procedure established by law\" within the meaning of the Article.40 In view of the difference of opinion between the two Judges on sentencing, matter referred to the larger Bench on sentencing only i.e. whether death sentence or life sentence). In fact, this case has acted as a catalytic agent for transformation of the judicial view on Art. 21. Since Maneka the Supreme Court has shown great sensitivity to the protection of personal liberty. The Court has re-interpreted Art. 21 and practically overruled Gopalan in Maneka Gandhi which can be regarded as a highly creative judicial pronouncement on the part of the Supreme Court. Not only that, since Maneka, the Supreme Court has given to Art. 21, broader and broader interpretation so as to imply many more Fundamental Rights. In course of time, Art. 21 has proved to be a very fruitful source of rights of the people. In Maneka Gandhi, the fact situation was as follows: S. 10(3)(c) of the Passport Act authorises the passport authority to impound a passport if it deems it necessary to do so in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of India, friendly relations of India with any foreign country, or in the interest of the general public. Maneka's passport was impounded by the Central Government under the Passport Act in the interest of the general public. Maneka filed a writ petition challenging the order on the ground of violation of her Fundamental Rights under Art. 21. One of the major grounds of challenge was that the order impounding the passport was null and void as it had been made without affording her an opportunity of being heard in her defence. The leading opinion in Maneka was pronounced by Justice Bhagwati.41 The Court laid down a number of propositions seeking to make Art. 21 much more meaningful than hitherto. (1) The Court reiterated the proposition that Arts. 14, 19 and 21 are not mutually exclusive. A nexus has been established between these three Articles. The theme of mutual relationship of Arts. 21 and 19 has already been discussed above.",

    "content": "leading opinion in Maneka was pronounced by Justice Bhagwati.41 The Court laid down a number of propositions seeking to make Art. 21 much more meaningful than hitherto. (1) The Court reiterated the proposition that Arts. 14, 19 and 21 are not mutually exclusive. A nexus has been established between these three Articles. The theme of mutual relationship of Arts. 21 and 19 has already been discussed above. This means that a law prescribing a procedure for depriving a person of 'personal liberty' has to meet the requirements of Art. 19. Also, the procedure established by law in Art. 21 must answer the requirement of Art. 14 as well. According to K. Iyer, J., no Article in the Constitution pertaining to a Fundamental Right is an island in itself. Just as a man is not dissectible into separate limbs, cardinal rights in an organic constitution have a Page 1243 synthesis. (2) The expression 'personal liberty' in Art. 21 was given an expansive interpretation. The Court emphasized that the expression 'personal liberty' is of the \"widest amplitude\" covering a variety of rights \"which go to constitute the personal liberty of man\". Some of these attributes have been raised to the status of distinct Fundamental Rights and given additional protection under Art. 19. The expression 'personal liberty' ought not to be read in a narrow and restricted sense so as to exclude those attributes of personal liberty which are specifically dealt with in Art. 19. \"The attempt of the Court should be to expand the reach and ambit of the Fundamental Rights rather than attenuate their meaning and content by a process of judicial construction.\" The right to travel abroad falls under Art. 21. According to Krishna Iyer, J., \"the spirit of man is at the root of Article 21\"; \"personal liberty makes for the worth of the human person\" and \"Travel makes liberty worthwhile\". Thus, no person can be deprived of his right to go abroad except according to procedure established by law. (3) The most significant and creative aspect of Maneka, is the re-interpretation by the Court of the expression 'procedure established by law' used in Art. 21. The Court now gave a new orientation to this expression. Article 21 would no longer mean that law could prescribe some semblance of procedure, however arbitrary or fanciful, to deprive a person of his personal liberty. It now means that the procedure must satisfy certain requisites in the sense of being fair and reasonable. The procedure \"cannot be arbitrary, unfair or unreasonable\". The concept of reasonableness must be projected in the procedure contemplated by Art. 21. The Court has now assumed the power to adjudge the fairness and justness of procedure established by law to deprive a person of his personal liberty. The Court has reached this conclusion by holding that Arts. 21, 19 and 14 are not mutually exclusive, but are inter-linked.42 The procedure contemplated by Art. 21 must answer the test of reasonableness in order to conform with Art. 14 for, in the words of Bhagwati, J:, \"The principle of reasonableness which legally as well as philosophically is an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness pervades Art. 14 like a brooding omnipresence.\" Thus, the procedure in Art. 21,43 \"must be 'right and just and fair' and not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive, otherwise, it would be no procedure at all and the requirement of Art. 21 would not be satisfied\". According to Iyer, J., procedure in Art. 21 means fair, not formal, procedure; 'law' is reasonable law and not any enacted piece. This makes the words \"procedure established by law\" by and large synonymous with the 'procedural due process' in the U.S.A.44 This makes the right of hearing a component part of natural justice.45 As the right to travel abroad falls under Art. 21, natural justice must be applied while exercising the power of impounding a passport under the Passport Act. Although the Passport Act does not expressly provide for the requirement of hearing before a passport is impounded, yet the same has to be implied therein.46 Maneka does not directly answer one question. Can a law laying down unreasonable procedure be declared to be unconstitutional under Art. 21, or only the action of the Administration depriving personal liberty? By and large such a question may be academic, for, in most cases, it may be possible to read elements of reasonable procedure in the statute in question, e.g., by bringing in natural justice. But then there may an odd case where it may not be possible to do so. In such a case, the Court may declare the law itself unconstitutional by reading Art. 21 along with Arts. 14 and 19. The Supreme Court has ruled specifically that Art. 14 outlaws unreasonableness and arbitrariness. (a) IMPACT OF MANEKA GANDHI Maneka Gandhi's case has been exerting multidimensional impact on development of Constitutional law in India. (1) Art. 21 which had lain dormant for nearly three decades has been brought to life by Maneka. Art. 21 has now assumed a \"highly activist magnitude\". Page 1244 According to Bhagwati, J., Art. 21 \"embodies a constitutional value of supreme importance in a democratic society.\"47 Iyer, J., has characterised Art. 21 as \"the procedural magna carta protective of life and liberty.\"48 The truth is, and this is supported by the discussion which follows, that Art. 21 has been emerging since Maneka as the Indian version of the American concept of \"due process of law\". Art. 21 has become the source of many substantive rights and procedural safeguards to the people. The Supreme Court has described this metamorphosis of Art. 21 as follows:49 \"Once Gopalan was overruled in R.C. Cooper,50 and its principle extended to Art. 21 in Maneka Gandhi, Art. 21 got unshackled from the restrictive meaning placed upon it in Gopalan. It came to acquire a force and vitality hitherto unimagined.",

    "content": "21 has become the source of many substantive rights and procedural safeguards to the people. The Supreme Court has described this metamorphosis of Art. 21 as follows:49 \"Once Gopalan was overruled in R.C. Cooper,50 and its principle extended to Art. 21 in Maneka Gandhi, Art. 21 got unshackled from the restrictive meaning placed upon it in Gopalan. It came to acquire a force and vitality hitherto unimagined. A burst of creative decisions of this Court fast on the heels of Maneka Gandhi gave a new meaning to the Article and expanded its content and connotation\". The reincarnation of Art. 21 which Maneka Gandhi brought about has been exerting a deep impact on contemporary constitutional jurisprudence. Maneka completely overrides the Gopalan view which had held the field for nearly three decades. Since Maneka, the Supreme Court has again and again underlined the theme that Arts. 14, 19 and 21 are not mutually exclusive, but they \"sustain, strengthen and nourish each other.\"51 For long, life and personal liberty occupied a back seat in India as accent was placed on property rights,52 but this situation has changed now. Maneka has brought the Fundamental Right of life and personal liberty into prominence; it is now regarded as the heart of Fundamental Rights. This is, as it should be, in a democratic society. To any civilized society, there can be no attributes more valuable than the life and personal liberty of its members. That is why the Supreme Court has now given pride of place to Art. 21. In quite a few cases in the post-Maneka era, the Supreme Court has given content to the concept of procedural fairness in relation to personal liberty.53 By establishing a nexus between Arts. 14 and 21, it is now clearly established that the procedure contemplated by Art. 21 must answer the test of reasonableness. Thus, Art. 21 has emerged as the Indian version of the American concept of due process of law and has become the source of many substantive rights and procedural safeguards to the people. The Court has observed in Maneka Gandhi: \"It is obvious that Art. 21, though couched in negative language, confers the Fundamental Right to life and personal liberty.\"54 (2) Maneka has also deeply influenced the administration of criminal justice and prison administration. In a number of cases, the Supreme Court has expounded several propositions with a view to humanise the administration of criminal justice in all its aspects.55 (3) Art. 21 has proved to be a very productive source of several Fundamental Rights over and above those mentioned in the Constitution in Arts. 14 to 31.56 (4) A significant dimension of Maneka is the impact it is having on the development of Administrative Law in India, but this aspect is not being discussed here as it falls outside the scope of this book.57 E. PRESENT VIEW OF ART. 21 Article 21 which had lain dormant for nearly three decades was brought to life by the now famous Supreme Court decision in Maneka Gandhi. Since then, Art. 21 has been on its way to emerge as the Indian version of the American concept of due process.58 It has become the source of many substantive rights and procedural safeguards to the people. Article 21 assures every person right to life and personal liberty. The term 'life' has been given a very expansive meaning. The term 'personal liberty' has been given a very wide amplitude covering a variety of rights which go to constitute personal liberty of a citizen. Its deprivation shall only be as per the relevant procedure prescribed in the relevant law, but the procedure has to be fair, just and reasonable. Page 1245 Article 21 uses four crucial expressions, viz., 'life', 'personal liberty', 'procedure' and 'law'. Each of these expressions has been explained below. (a) LIFE The expression 'life' in Art. 21 has been interpreted by the Supreme Court rather liberally and broadly. Over time, the Court has been giving an expansive interpretation to 'life'. The Court has often quoted the following observation of Field, J., in Munn v. Illinois,59 an American case : \"By the term 'life' as here used something more is meant than mere animal existence. The inhibition against its deprivation extends to all those limbs and faculties by which life is enjoyed. The provision equally prohibits the mutilation of the body by the amputation of an arm or leg....\" The right to life guaranteed under Article 21 embraces within its sweep not only physical existence but the quality of life. If any statutory provisions run counter to such a right, it must be held unconstitutional.60 The Court referred to the explanation of the concepts of 'life' and 'liberty' in the 5th and 14th amendment to the US Constitution in these words :- \"By the term 'life' as here used, something more is meant than mere animal existence. The inhibition against its deprivation extends to all those limbs and faculties by which life is enjoyed\". Bhagwati, J., has observed in Fracis Coralie61: \"We think that the right to life includes the right to live with human dignity and all that goes along with it, namely, the bare necessaries of life such as adequate nutrition, clothing and shelter over the head and facilities for reading, writing and expressing oneself in diverse forms, freely moving about and mixing and commingling with fellow human beings\". Thus, the inhibition against deprivation of 'life' would extend to all those faculties by which life is enjoyed.",

    "content": "the State of Kerala Scheduled Tribes case62 the Supreme Court considered the issue as to whether a law which provided that the Tribals should be rehabilitated in their own habitat when a prior alienation by the Tribe was or is illegal violating Art.21 of the Constitution at the instance of the alien; while considering the question the Court considered the disadvantage, social and economic status of the Tribals and concluded that having regard to the studies conducted by the State Government and as a balance of interest between tribals and non-tribals, there was no trangression of Art. 21. In P. Rathinam v. Union of India63, the Supreme Court has defined 'life' as follows : \"The right to live with human dignity and the same does not connote continued drudgery. It takes within its fold some of the fine graces of civilization which makes life worth living and that the expanded concept of life would mean the tradition, culture and heritage of the person concerned.\" In Francis Coralie,64 the Supreme Court has held that the expression 'life' in Art. 21 does not connote merely physical or animal existence but embraces something more. \"We think that the right to life includes the right to live with human dignity and all that goes along with it, namely, the bare necessity of life such as adequate nutrition, clothing and shelter over their head\". A person's reputation is a facet of his right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution.65 In Shantisar Builders v. Narayanan Khimalal Totame66, the Supreme Court has observed : \"The right to life under Art. 21 would include the right of food, clothing, decent environment and reasonable accommodation to live in. The difference between the need of an animal and a human being for shelter has to be kept in view. For the animal, it is the bare protection of the body, for a human being, it has to be suitable accommodation which allows him to grow in all aspects-physical, mental and intellectual.\" In Olga Tellis,67 the Supreme Court has emphasized that the term 'life' in Art. 21 is not only restricted to the mere animal existence of a person. It means something more and \"the inhibition against the deprivation of life extends to all those limits and faculties by which life is enjoyed.68 The ambit and sweep of the 'right to life' Page 1246 embodied in Art. 21 is wide and far reaching. It does not mean only that life cannot be extinguished as taken away but much more than that. In D.B.M. Patnaik v. State of Andhra Pradesh,69 some prisoners challenged some restrictions as violating their right under Art. 21. The Supreme Court stated that a convict is not denuded of all his Fundamental Rights. Imprisonment after conviction is bound to curtail some of his rights, e.g., freedom of speech or movement, but certain other rights, e.g., the right to hold property, could still be enjoyed by a prisoner. A convict could also claim that he should not be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law. The Supreme Courthas however held that posting of police guards outside the jail, or living of policemen in vacant land adjacent to, but outside, the prison could not be said to cause any interference with the personal liberty of the prisoners. Similarly, a prisoner could not complain of the installation of a high-voltage live-wire mechanism on the jail walls to prevent escape of prisoners. A convict has no Fundamental Right to escape from the prison. The machanism is only a preventive measure intended to act as a deterrent to those who try to escape and a convict is likely to come in contact with it only when he attempts to escape from the prison. The Supreme Court has stated in R.M. Malkani v. State of Maharashtra,70 with reference to Art. 21, that the telephonic conversation of an innocent citizen would be protected by Courts against wrongful or high-handed interference by tapping of the conversation by the police. The protection is not for the guilty against the efforts of the police to vindicate the law. The concept of 'life' has been expansively interpreted in recent years implying a host of Fundamental Rights therefrom. This aspect has been discussed later in this Chapter.71 (b) PERSONAL LIBERTY The expression 'personal liberty' used in Art. 21 has also been given a liberal interpretation. It does not mean merely the liberty of the body, i.e., freedom from physical restraint or freedom from confinement within the bounds of a prison. In other words, it means not only freedom from arrest or detention, from false imprisonment or wrongful confinement, but means much more than that. The term 'personal liberty' is not used in a narrow sense but has been used in Art. 21 as a compendious term to include within it all those variety of rights of a person which go to make up the personal liberty of a man. Liberty of an individual has to be balanced with his duties and obligations towards his fellow citizens.72 To begin with, the term 'personal liberty' in Art. 21 was interpreted so as to exclude the rights mentioned specifically in Art. 19.73 The view was expressed in Kharak Singh that while Art. 19(1) dealt with particular species or attributes of that freedom, 'personal liberty' in Art. 21 would take in and comprise the residue. This was the projection of the Gopalan approach of keeping Art. 21 separate from Art. 19. Nevertheless, the Court gave quite a broad dimension to the term 'personal liberty' used in Art. 21.",

    "content": "Nevertheless, the Court gave quite a broad dimension to the term 'personal liberty' used in Art. 21. The Court ruled that the term 'personal liberty' is used as a compendious term to include within itself all the varieties of rights which go to make up the \"personal liberties\" For example, the Supreme Court held in Kharak Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh74 that while night domicillary visits by police (involving intrusion into his residence, knocking at his door and disturbing his sleep and ordinary confort) constitute an infringement of personal liberty of an individual enshrined in Art. 21, secret picketing of the house by the police or shadowing of his movements do not fall under Art. 21 but under Art. 19(1)(d). But the minority view expressed by Subba Rao, J., adopted a much wider concept of personal liberty. He differed from the majority view that Art. 21 excluded what was guaranteed by Art. 19. He pleaded for an overlapping approach, i.e., both Arts. 21 and 19 not excluding, but overlapping, each other. The learned Judge observed :75 \"No doubt the expression 'personal liberty' is a comprehensive one and the right to move freely is an attribute of personal liberty. It is said that the freedom to move freely is carved out of personal liberty and, therefore, the expression 'personal liberty' in Art. 21 excludes that attribute. In our view, this is not a correct approach. Both are independent Fundamental Rights, though there is overlapping. There is no question of one being carved out of another. The Fundamental Right of life and personal liberty have many attributes and some of them are found in Article 19. If a person's Fundamental Right under Art. 21 is infringed, the State can rely upon a law to sustain the action; but that Page 1247 cannot be a complete answer unless the said law satisfies the test laid down in Art. 19(2) so far as the attributes covered by Articles 19(1) are concerned. In other words, the State must satisfy that both the Fundamental Rights are not infringed by showing that there is a law and that it does not amount to a reasonable restriction within the meaning of Art. 19(2) of the Constitution.\" In course of time, the view of Subba Rao, J., has become the accepted view.76 Agreeing with the approach of the minority in Kharak Singh, Bhagwati, J., observed in Maneka Gandhi: \"The expression 'personal liberty' in Art. 21 is of the widest amplitude and it covers a variety of rights which go to constitute the personal liberty of man and some of them have been raised to the status of distinct Fundamental Rights and given additional protection under Article 19\". The expression \"personal liberty\" in Art. 21 is of the widest amplitude and it covers a variety of rights which go to constitute the personal liberty of man and some of them have been raised to the status of distinct Fundamental Rights and given additional protection under Art. 19. Right to personal liberty also means the life free from encroachments unsustainable in law. Any law interfering with personal liberty of a person must satisfy a triple test (i) it must prescribe a procedure;(ii) the procedure must withstand the test of one or more of the Fundamental Rights conferred under Art. 19 which may be applicable in a given situation; and (iii) it must also be liable to be tested with reference to Art. 14.77 A 2009 judgment reasserts that strict boundaries of 'personal liberty' cannot be identified but at the same time mandates that such liberty must also accommodate public interest. A woman's right to make reproductive choices has been held to be a dimension of \"personal liberty\" within the meaning of Art. 21.78In Suchita Srivastava, an orphan woman of age 19-20 years and already suffering from mild mental retardation, was found pregnant (allegedly of having been raped) while staying in a Government-run Welfare Institution. The Punjab & Haryana High Court based on the report of an Expert Committee directed termination of the pregnancy under the provisions of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971. The victim, however, had desired for continuation of her pregnancy. One of the questions before theSupreme Courtwas whether in applying the 1971 Act the Fundamental Right of the victim under Art. 21 had been violated. The Supreme Court answered the question in the affirmative. The Court said: \"There is no doubt that a women's right to make reproductive choices is also a dimension of \"personal liberty\" as understood under Art. 21 of the Constitution of India. It is important to recognize that reproductive choices can be exercised to procreate as well as to abstain from procreating. The crucial consideration is that a woman's right to privacy, dignity and bodily integrity should be respected.\" The Court, however, considered that there is also a \"compelling State interest\" in protecting the life of the prospective child and, therefore, the termination of the pregnancy could only be permitted under the conditions specified in the 1971 Act which are to be viewed as reasonable restrictions placed on the exercise of reproductive choices. Preventive justice requires an action to be taken to prevent apprehended objectionable activities. But at the same time, since a person's greatest of human freedoms i.e. personal liberty, is deprived, the laws of preventive detention are strictly construed. Further a meticulous compliance with the procedural safeguard, however technical, is mandatory. Personal liberty protected under Art. 21 is so sacrosanct and so high in the scale of Constitutional values that it is the obligation of the detaining authority to show that the impugned detention meticulously accords with the procedure established by law.79 In Francis Coralie,80 upholding the right of a detenu to have interviews with her friends and family members, Bhagwati, J., held that personal liberty includes rights to socialise with family members and friends as well as to have interviews with her friends.",

    "content": "person detained in preventive detention wrote a scientific book, but the government refused permission to him to send it to his wife for publication. The Supreme Court in Prabhakar81 held it to be an infringement of detenu's personal liberty as under Art. 21 prohibiting a person from writing a book without there being any legal provision to that effect would be unconstitutional. Page 1248 In Satwant Singh v. A.P.O .82 the right to travel abroad was held to be an aspect of 'personal liberty' of an individual and, therefore, no person can be deprived of his right to travel except according to the procedure established by law. Since a passport is essential for the enjoyment of that right, denial of a passport amounts to deprivation of personal liberty. Hence, a passport for travel cannot be denied except according to procedure established by law. The Supreme Court has ruled in Sodhan Singh83 that Art. 21 does not cover freedom of trade or commerce. \"The right to carry on any trade or business and the concept of life and personal liberty within Art. 21 are too remote to be connected together\". In civil litigation, e.g., to decide the question of paternity of a child, no party can be compelled by the Court to undergo medical examination or blood group test against his will in the absence of any statutory provision for the purpose. No adverse inference can be drawn against him from his refusal to undergo any such test. Otherwise it amounts to violation of his personal liberty guaranteed by Art. 21.84 Right of accused to be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice is protection, and any interfere would be violation of Art. 21.85 (c) LAW Ordinarily, the word 'law' in Art. 21 denotes an 'enacted' law, i.e. a law made by a Legislature. But that is not all. Art. 21 does not mean merely what is enacted by a Legislature. 'Law' may take several other forms as well. Does the word 'law' in Art. 21 include an 'ordinance'? Can an ordinance lay down procedure to deprive a person of his personal liberty? The question was raised in A.K. Roy v. Union of India86 in the context of the National Security Ordinance, 1980, promulgated by the President \"to provide for preventive detention in certain cases and for matters connected therewith.87 The petitioners argued that Art. 21 does not cover an \"ordinance\" because it is not 'law' as it is made by the executive and not by the legislature. It was further argued that the underlying object of Art. 21 is to wholly deny to the executive the power to deprive a person of his life or liberty. Therefore, Ordinance-making power, which is executive power, cannot be used to deprive a person of his liberty. The executive cannot resort to the power to make ordinances so as to remove the restraints imposed upon it by Art. 21. Using an Ordinance for the purpose will liberate it from the discipline of laws made by a democratic legislature. Arts. 14, 19 and 21 will be reduced to a dead letter if the executive is permitted to take away the life and liberty of the people by an ordinance. The Supreme Court had no difficulty in demolishing these arguments whose central theme was: \"ordinance is not law\". After referring to various constitutional provisions concerning the ordinance-making power,88 the Court concluded: \"............... the Constitution makes no distinction in principle between a law made by the legislature and an ordinance issued by the President. Both, equally, are products of the exercise of legislative power and, therefore, both are equally subject to the limitations which the Constitution has placed upon that power\". An ordinance is as much law as an Act passed by a legislature and is subject to the same inhibitions. Thus, the word 'law' in Art. 21 would include an 'ordinance'. The Court also said that since an ordinance is subject to the same restraints as a law made by a legislature, there can be no danger that Arts. 14, 19 and 21 could be obliterated as an ordinance is subject to the Fundamental Rights like an Act of a Legislature. Article 21 also takes in several species of laws other than the laws enacted by the legislature. The Supreme Court has rule-making powers under Art. 145.89 The rules made by the Supreme Court are comprised within the term 'law' in Art. 21. A tout can be kept outside the precincts of the Court after the procedure established by the rules of the Court has been observed.90 Similarly, rules made by the High Court under Art. 225 fall within the scope of Art. 21.91 Page 1249 In State of Nagaland v. Ratan Singh,1rules made for the governance of the tribal areas of Nagaland were held to fall within Art. 21. The said rules, it was contended, violated Art. 21 because the rules said that not the Criminal Procedure Code but its \"spirit\" was to govern the administration of justice. It was argued that \"this is not a law because it leaves each officer free to act arbitrarily.\" TheSupreme Court rejected the argument saying that the rules were made with a view to simplicity as the people in the backward tracts could not be expected to make themselves aware of the technicalities of a complex code. The idea was that in the administration of criminal justice, the technical rules would not prevail over the substance of the matter and defence effectively unhampered by the technicalities of complex laws. The Criminal Procedure Codehas been excluded from this area as it would be too difficult for the local people to understand it, and it would retard justice in these backward tracts. \"Instead the spirit of the Criminal Procedure Code has been asked to be applied so that justice may not fail because of some technicality.\" In M.S.M. Sharma v. Shri Krishan Sinha,2 the rules made by a House of the State Legislature under Art.",

    "content": "Criminal Procedure Codehas been excluded from this area as it would be too difficult for the local people to understand it, and it would retard justice in these backward tracts. \"Instead the spirit of the Criminal Procedure Code has been asked to be applied so that justice may not fail because of some technicality.\" In M.S.M. Sharma v. Shri Krishan Sinha,2 the rules made by a House of the State Legislature under Art. 208 have been regarded as laying down procedure established by 'law' for purposes of Art. 21. Art. 21 applies to the area of legislative privileges and, thus, a person cannot be imprisoned for breach of privilege of a legislature except in accordance with the procedure established by law. Proceedings held before the Committee of Privileges of a House of legislature under the rules framed by it in pursuance of Art. 208 or Art. 118 are in accordance with procedure established by law. Regulations made under the Police Act fall under Art. 21.3 But departmental instructions made without any statutory authority, and not having the force of law, do not constitute 'law' for the purposes of Art. 21, and they cannot validly put restraints on an individual's personal liberty.4 (d) PROCEDURE It is now established after Maneka Gandhi that 'procedure' for purposes of Art. 21 has to be reasonable, fair and just. The Supreme Court has asserted in Kartar Singh v. State of Punjab5 that the procedure contemplated by Art. 21 is that it must be \"right, just and fair\" and not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive. In order that the procedure be right, just and fair, it must conform to natural justice. The expression \"procedure established by law\" extends both to substantive as well as procedural law. A procedure not fulfilling these attributes is no procedure at all in the eyes of Art. 21. The procedure of putting a poor person in prison for failure to pay his debts6 is violative of Art. 21 \"unless there is proof of the minimal fairness of his wilful failure to pay in spite of his sufficient means and absence of more terribly pressing claims on his means..........\"7. In the instant case, the judgment debtors had failed to repay their debts and, consequently, their property was attached. In addition a warrant for their arrest and dention in civil prison was also issued. The Supreme Court ruled that the procedure of putting a person in prison to recover debts violated Art. 21. Article 21 in view of its expansive meaning not only protects life and liberty but also envisages a fair procedure. Liberty of a person should not ordinarily be interfered with unless there exist cogent grounds therefore.8 The Special Courts Bill, 1978, proposed that a special Court would be constituted to try certain persons holding high political offices during the emergency of 1975-1977.9 The special Court was to be presided over by a sitting or retired judge of a High Court to be appointed by the Central Government in consultation with the Chief Justice of India. The accused could appeal to the Supreme Court against the verdict of the special Court.10 One of the questions considered by the Supreme Court was whether the procedure envisaged in the Bill was fair and reasonable with reference to Art. 21 as interpreted in Maneka Gandhi.11 The Court emphasized that the procedure must be \"right and just and fair and not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive otherwise it will be no procedure at all and the requirement of Art. 21 would not be satisfied.\" Accordingly, the Court suggested three modifications in the Bill to make the procedure just and fair. (i) There should be a provision for transferring a case from one special Court to another. This was necessary to avoid trial of an accused by a judge who may be biased against him. Page 1250 (ii) Only a sitting High Court Judge, and not a retired Judge, ought to be appointed, for the retired Judge would hold his office as a Judge of the special Court during the pleasure of the government and \"the pleasure doctrine is subversive of judicial independence.\" (iii) Instead of mere consultation with the Chief Justice, there should be provision for his concurrence to the appointment of the presiding Judge. Such a procedure was necessary to inspire confidence not only of the accused but of the entire community in the special Court. Video-conferencing is an advancement in science and technology which permits one to see, hear and talk with someone far away, with the same facility and ease as if they were in presence of each other. So long as the accused or his pleader are present when evidence is recorded by video-conferencing, such evidence is being recorded in the \"presence\" of the accused and would thus fully meet the requirements of S. 273Cr. P.C. and recording of such evidence would be as per \"procedure established by law.\"12 The Assam Disturbed Areas Act, 1955 (Assam Act) and the Armed Forces (Assam and Manipur) Special Powers Act, 1958 (Central Act) confer very broad powers on the government and the police officers. The State Government can declare any area in Assam as a disturbed area. Police officers (not below a certain rank) and military officers then get the power to fire upon or to use force even to the extent of causing death to maintain public order.13 The validity of both the Acts was questioned on the ground inter alia that there was no safeguard to possible abuse in exercise of the powers conferred by the Acts in question.",

    "content": "Delhi High Court upheld both the Acts in Inderjit Barua v. Assam .14 The Court observed: \"What is, therefore, just, fair and reasonable procedure established by reasonable law as opposed to procedure which can be called arbitrary or discriminatory is a question to be answered in the facts and circumstances of a case.\"15 If to save hundreds of lives one life is put in peril, or if a law ensures and protects the greater social interest, then such a law will be regarded as a wholesome and beneficial law although it may infringe the liberty of some individuals: \"It will ensure for the liberty of the greater number of the members of the society at the cost of one or a few.\" The Court has further emphasized that it is the duty of the State to preserve law and order.16\"It is the state's duty to see that the rule of law enunciated by Art. 21 is available to the greatest number.\" Individuals have the right of private defence and even a stranger can act to prevent crime. If individuals have such a right surely the State can enact a statute to subserve the social purpose of ensuring public order so that life and liberty are preserved. The power of the State Government to declare any area as 'disturbed area' was held not to be arbitrary. Such an area is one where disorder of such type prevails so as to be regarded as a public order problem. Guidelines in this respect are available from the preamble and the long title of the concerned Act. The term 'disturbed area' has been used in a number of laws and so the term is well understood. The term 'public order' is not vague.17 The vast power conferred on the police and military officers, held the Court, could not be regarded as 'arbitrary', or, in other words, 'unjust, unfair and unreasonable'. There are sufficient safeguards postulated to ensure proper exercise of power, e.g. first the area must be declared as 'disturbed'; S. 144,Cr. P.C., must be in force; only so much force must be used as necessary in the circumstances of the situation; if it is feasible to give warning then the warning must be given before firing.18 The High Court thus upheld a drastic procedure in the interest of maintenance of law and order in the country. The High Court took recourse to the thesis that the State as such has as much right to defend itself against aggression as a private person has of self-defence. In Olga Tellis,19 the Supreme Court has again emphasized that \"the procedure prescribed by law for the deprivation of the right conferred by Art. 21 must be fair, just and reasonable\". The procedure prescribed by law for depriving a person of his right to life must conform to the norms of justice and fair play. \"Procedure which is unjust or unfair in the circumstances of a case, attracts the vice of unreasonableness, thereby vitiating the law which prescribes that procedure and, consequently, the action taken under it\". Page 1251 (e) ONUS OF PROOF Presumption of innocence is a human right. Article 21 in view of its expansive meaning not only protects life and liberty but also envisages a fair procedure.20 From the point of view of the burden of proof, the Courts draw a distinction between Art. 14, on the one hand, and Arts. 19 and 21, on the other.21 The point has been elaborately discussed by the Supreme Court in Deena v. Union of India .22 In the generality of cases under Art. 14, the challenge is based on the allegation that the impugned provision is discriminatory. In such matters, the petitioner has to plead and prove that there are others who are similarly situated as he and that he has been singled out and subjected to unfavourable treatment. Whether there are other persons similarly situated as the petitioner is a question of fact. So, the burden to establish the existence of these facts rests on the petitioner.23 As regards Arts. 19 and 21, in a challenge under these provisions, once the petitioner shows that his right has been taken away, it is for the State to justify the impugned law by showing that the restriction is reasonable (Art. 19),24 or that the procedure is not arbitrary but is just, fair and reasonable (Art. 21)25. In Art. 19, \"the burden is never on the petitioner to prove that the restriction is not reasonable or that the restriction is not in the interests of matters mentioned in Cl. 2\".26 Likewise, under Art. 21, \"the burden is never on the petitioner to prove that the procedure prescribed by law which deprives him of his life or personal liberty is unjust, unfair or unreasonable.\"27 \"Bachan Singh is an authority for the proposition that in cases arising under Art. 21 of the Constitution, if it appears that a person is being deprived of his life or has been deprived of his personal liberty, the burden rests on the State to establish the constitutional validity of the impugned law.\"28 In Deena, the Supreme Court has emphasized that the weakness of the petitioners cannot establish the case of the government, for, in matters involving the citizens' freedoms under Art. 19, or the right to life and liberty of persons under Art. 21, the burden of proof lies on the government to prove that its action is constitutional. F. CRIMINAL JUSTICE AFTERMANEKA GANDHI Maneka Gandhi is having a profound but beneficial impact on the administration of criminal justice in India.",

    "content": "administration of criminal justice and the conditions prevailing in prisons have long been extremely deplorable and sub-human; prisoners are mal-treated; criminal trials are inordinately delayed; police brutality is legendary.29 Every day one hears news of police brutality, prison maladministration and inordinately long delay in trial of criminal cases resulting in grave miscarriage of justice.30 In spite of the accent on socio-economic justice in the Constitution,31 precious little has been done so far to improve matters in the area of criminal justice. Administration of criminal justice is a State matter. Fortunately, by reinterpreting Art. 21 in Maneka Gandhi, and by giving up the sterile approach of Gopalan, the Supreme Court has found a potent tool to seek to improve matters, and to fill in the vacuum arising from governmental inaction and apathy to undertake reform, in the area of criminal justice. The Court has now been seeking to humanise and liberalise the administration of criminal justice. The key to this judicial activism is the ruling in Maneka Gandhi that the phrase \"procedure established by law\" in Art. 21 does not mean 'any procedure' laid down in a statute but \"just, fair and reasonable\" procedure, and that the term 'law' in Art. 21 envisages not any law but a law which is \"right, just and fair, and not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive\". An arbitrary law violates Art. 14. Arbitrary procedure would be no procedure at all and the requirements of Art. 21 would not be complied with. A procedure which is unreasonable, harsh and prejudicial to the accused cannot be in consonance with Art. 21.32 This judicial approach has made Art. 21 more or less synonymous Page 1252 with the concept of procedural due process in the U.S.A. The Supreme Court has observed in Sunil Batra II that thanks to Art. 21, \"human rights jurisprudence in India has a constitutional status and sweep... so that this magna carta may well toll the knell of human bondage beyond civilized limits\".33 Accordingly, since Maneka, the Supreme Court has in a number of cases tested various aspects of criminal justice and prison administration on this touchstone. The protection of Art. 21 extends to all persons--persons accused of offences, undertrial prisoners, prisoners undergoing jail sentences etc., and, thus, all aspects of criminal justice fall under the umbrella of Arts. 14, 19 and 21. (a) INVESTIGATION Article 21 envisages a fair trial, a fair procedure and a fair investigation. By reason of such a right alone the appellant was entitled not only to be informed about his fundamental right and statutory rights but it was obligatory on the part of the Special Public Prosecutor to place on record the requisite materials before the Designated Judge to show that the appellant, after his arrest in Delhi case on 23-7-1993 was not an absconder and thus the provisions of Section 299 of the Code was not attracted.34 Such right extends not only to actual proceedings in court but also includes within its sweep the preceding police investigation as well.35 Although free and fair trial is sine qua non of Article 21, the apprehension of denial must be reasonable and not imaginary. Reasonableness would obviously depend on the facts and circumstances of a case and their evaluations by the Courts.36 (b) ARREST In Joginder Kumar v. State of Uttar Pradesh,37 the Apex Court has issued directions regarding arrest. The Court has emphasized that a police officer may have the power to arrest but justification for exercising the power is quite another matter. Arrest can cause incalculable harm to a person's reputation and self-esteem. Arrest should be made not merely on suspicion but only after a reasonable satisfaction reached after some investigation as to the genuineness and bona fides of the complaint and a reasonable belief as to the person's complicity and even as to the need to effect arrest. The Court has now expressly said that arrest is not a must in all cases of cognizable offences.38 The arrested man has certain rights, viz., he has a right that a relative/friend of his be informed about his arrest and the place of his detention; he has a right to consult a lawyer privately. (c) FAIR TRIAL Conducting a fair trial for those who are accused of criminal offences is the cornerstone of democracy. Conducting a fair trial is beneficial both to the accused as well as to the society. A conviction resulting from an unfair trial is contrary to our concept of justice.39 Fair trial obviously would mean a trial before an impartial judge, a fair prosecutor and an atmosphere of judicial calm. Fair trial means a trial in which bias or prejudice for or against the accused, the witnesses, or the cause which is being tried is eliminated. If the witnesses get threatened or are forced to give false evidence that also would not result in a fair trial. The failure to hear material witnesses is certainly denial of fair trial.40 Right to fair trial in a criminal prosecution is enshrined in Art. 21. For example, S. 142 of the Evidence Act does not give power to the prosecution to put leading questions on the material part of the evidence which a witness intends to give against the accused. To do so infringes the right of the accused to have a fair trial which is enshrined in Art. 21. This is not a curable irregularity.41 Page 1253 Right to have a fair trial strictly in terms of the Juvenile Justice Act which would include procedural safeguard is a Fundamental Right of the juvenile.42 (d) SPEEDY TRIAL Speedy trial as such is not mentioned as a specific Fundamental Right in the Constitution. The Criminal Procedure Code does not guarantee specifically any right to speedy trial. Nor is there any provision prescribing the maximum period for which a magistrate can keep an undertrial in jail without trial. Nevertheless, the Supreme Courthas recognised the same to be implicit in the spectrum of Art.",

    "content": "Criminal Procedure Code does not guarantee specifically any right to speedy trial. Nor is there any provision prescribing the maximum period for which a magistrate can keep an undertrial in jail without trial. Nevertheless, the Supreme Courthas recognised the same to be implicit in the spectrum of Art. 21 and has derived the right of an accused to a speedy trial from Art. 21. It is well settled that the right to speedy trial in all criminal prosecutions is an inalienable right under Article 21 of the Constitution. This right is applicable not only to the actual proceedings in court but also includes within its sweep the preceding police investigations as well. The right to speedy trial extends equally to all criminal prosecutions and is not confined to any particular category of cases. In every case, where the right to speedy trial is alleged to have been infringed, the court has to perform the balancing act upon taking into consideration all the attendant circumstances and determine in each case whether the right to speedy trial has been denied in a given case. The Court noted that the prosecution had failed to show any exceptional circumstance which could possibly be taken into consideration for condoning callous and inordinate delay of more than two decades in investigations and the trial and in particular noted that even till date of the judgment the State is not sure whether a sanction for prosecuting the appellant is required and if so, whether it had been granted or not.43 Quick justice is now regarded as sine qua non of Art. 21. Inordinately long delay may be taken as presumptive proof of prejudice. In this context, the fact of incarceration of the accused will also be a relevant fact. The prosecution should not be allowed to become a persecution. But when does the prosecution become persecution, again depends upon the facts of a given case.44 Speedy trial is a Fundamental Right implicit in the broad sweep and content of Article 21. The article confers a Fundamental Right on every person not to be deprived of his life or liberty except in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law. The procedure so prescribed must ensure a speedy trial for determination of the guilt of such person. It is conceded that some amount of deprivation of personal liberty cannot be avoided, but if the period of deprivation pending trial becomes unduly long, fairness assured by Art. 21 would receive a jolt.45 The Supreme Court has laid great emphasis on speedy trial of criminal offences, and has emphasized: \"It is implicit in the broad sweep and content of Article 21.\"46 A fair trial implies a speedy trial. No procedure can be 'reasonable, fair or just' unless \"that procedure ensures a speedy trial for determination of the guilt of such person.\" The Supreme Court has observed: \"No procedure which does not ensure a reasonably quick trial can be regarded as \"reasonable, fair or just' and it would fall foul of Article 21. There can, therefore, be no doubt that speedy trial and by speedy trial we mean reasonably expeditious trial, is an integral and essential part of the Fundamental Right to life and liberty enshrined in Art. 21.\" The Supreme Court has emphasized and re-emphasized this proposition again and again. In Kartar Singh v. State of Punjab,47 the Court has observed: \"The concept of speedy trial is read into Article 21 as an essential part of the Fundamental Right to life and liberty guaranteed and preserved under our Constitution. The right to speedy trial begins with the actual restraint imposed by arrest and consequent incarceration and continues at all stages, namely, the stage of investigation, inquiry, trial, appeal and revision so that any possible prejudice that may result from impermissible and avoidable delay from the time of the commission of the offence till it consummates into a finality, can be averred\". In Hussainara (II),48 the Supreme Court has emphasized that financial constraints and priorities in expenditure would not enable the Government to avoid its duty to ensure speedy trial to the accused. Thus, seriousness of the offence is not sufficient to oust Art. 21. Where currency notes were recovered from Page 1254 the appellant in the year 1981 who was caught red-handed but charge-sheet was filed in 2007 during the pendency of petition filed in 1998 under S. 482CrPC alleging undue harassment for eighteen years, the Court held that it was a clear case of violation of fundamental rights of the accused conferred by Art. 21 and the criminal case was liable to be quashed.49 Speedy trial is thus \"an integral and essential part of the Fundamental Right to life and liberty enshrined in Article 21.\"50 In Kadra Pahadiya v. State of Bihar,51 several under-trials were languishing in jail for 8 years without their trial having made any progress. The Supreme Court commented: \"It is a crying shame upon our adjudicatory system which keeps men in jail for years on end without a trial.\" Emphasizing that 'speedy trial is a Fundamental Right of an accused implicit in Art. 21 of the Constitution,' the Court directed the concerned session judge to complete the trial expeditiously. The Court also said that any accused who is denied this right can approach the Supreme Court for the purpose of enforcing this right, and the Court in discharge of its constitutional obligation has the power to give necessary directions to the government for securing this right to the accused. But, at the same time, the Court has ruled that a delayed trial is not necessarily an unfair trial and a trial cannot be quashed merely on the ground of delay.52 Where the Court comes to the conclusion that the right to speedy trial of an accused has been infringed, the charge or the conviction may be quashed.",

    "content": "circumstances may be such that quashing of proceedings will not subserve the interest of justice and in such a situation, it will be open to the court to make an appropriate order as it may deem just and equitable, including fixation of time-frame for conclusion of the trial.53 The Supreme Court has reiterated in Abdul Rehman Antulay v. R.S. Naik,54 that there is a right to speedy trial of the case pending against him. But there can be no time limit within which a trial must be completed. \"It is, thus, the obligation of the state or the complainant, as the case may be, to proceed with the case with reasonable promptitude.\"55 Whenever a complaint of infringement of right to speedy trial is made, the Court has to consider all the circumstances of the case and arrive at a decision whether in fact the proceedings have been pending for an unjustifiably long period. Regarding the right to speedy trial, the Court has laid down the following propositions as guidelines, without seeking to be exhaustive, as \"it is difficult to foresee all situations:56 1. Fair, just and reasonable procedure implicit in Article 21 of the Constitution creates a right in the accused to be tried speedily. Right to speedy trial is the right of the accused. The fact that a speedy trial is also in public interest or that it serves the societal interest also does not make it any-the-less the right of the accused. It is in the interest of all concerned that the guilt or innocence of the accused is determined as quickly as possible in the circumstances. 2. Right to speedy trial flowing from Art. 21 encompasses all the stages, namely, the stage of investigation, inquiry, trial, appeal, revision and re-trial. 3. The concerns underlying the right to speedy trial from the point of view of the accused are: (a) the period of remand and pre-conviction detention should be as short as possible. In other words, the accused should not be subjected to unnecessary or unduly long incarceration prior to his conviction; (b) the worry, anxiety, expense and disturbance to his vocation and peace, resulting from an unduly prolonged investigation, enquiry or trial should be minimal; and (c) undue delay may well result in impairment of the ability of the accused to defend himself, whether on account of death, disappearance or non-availability of witnesses or otherwise. 4. At the same time, one cannot ignore the fact that it is usually the accused who is interested in delaying the proceedings. As is often pointed out, \"delay is a known defence tactic\". Since the burden of proving the guilt of the accused lies upon the prosecution, delay ordinarily prejudices the prosecution. Non-availability of Page 1255 witnesses, disappearance of evidence by lapse of time really work against the interest of the prosecution. Of course, there may be cases where the prosecution, for whatever reason, also delays the proceedings. Therefore, in every case, where the right to speedy trial is alleged to have been infringed, the first question to be put and answered is--who is responsible for the delay? Proceedings taken by either party in good faith, to vindicate their rights and interest, as perceived by them, cannot be treated as delaying tactics nor can the time taken in pursuing such proceedings be counted towards delay. It goes without saying that frivolous proceedings or proceedings taken merely for delaying the day of reckoning cannot be treated as proceedings taken in good faith. The mere fact that an application/petition is admitted and an order of stay granted by a superior Court is by itself no proof that the proceeding is not frivolous. Very often these stays are obtained on ex parte representation. 5. While determining whether undue delay has occurred (resulting in violation of right to speedy trial) one must have regard to all the attendant circumstances, including nature of offence, number of accused and witnesses, the work-load of the Court concerned, prevailing local conditions and so on--what is called, the systematic delays. It is true that it is the obligation of the State to ensure a speedy trial and State includes judiciary as well, but a realistic and practical approach should be adopted in such matters instead of a pedantic one. 6. Each and every delay does not necessarily prejudice the accused. Some delays may indeed work to his advantage. However, inordinately long delay may be taken as presumptive proof of prejudice. In this context, the fact of incarceration of accused will also be a relevant fact. The prosecution should not be allowed to become a persecution. But when does the prosecution become persecution, again depends upon the facts of a given case. 7. The Court has refused to accept the 'demand' rule. An accused cannot try himself; he is tried by the Court at the behest of the prosecution. Hence, an accused's plea of denial of speedy trial cannot be defeated by saying that the accused did at no time demand a speedy trial. If in a given case, he did make such a demand and yet he was not tried speedily, it would be a plus point in his favour, but the mere non-asking for a speedy trial cannot be put against the accused. 8. Ultimately, the Court has to balance and weigh the several relevant factors-- 'balancing test' or 'balancing process'--and determine in each case whether the right to speedy trial has been denied in a given case. 9. Ordinarily speaking, where the Court comes to the conclusion that the right to speedy trial of an accused has been infringed, the charges or the conviction, as the case may be, shall be quashed.57 But this is not the only course open. The nature of the offence and other circumstances in a given case may be such that quashing of proceedings may not be in the interest of justice.",

    "content": "nature of the offence and other circumstances in a given case may be such that quashing of proceedings may not be in the interest of justice. In such a case, it is open to the Court to make such other appropriate order--including an order to conclude the trial within a fixed time where the trial is not concluded or reducing the sentence where the trial has concluded--as may be deemed just and equitable in the circumstances of the case. 10. It is neither advisable nor practicable to fix any time-limit for trial of offences. Any such rule is bound to be qualified one. Such rule cannot also be evolved merely to shift the burden of providing justification on to the shoulders of the prosecution. In every case of complaint of denial of right to speedy trial it is primarily for the prosecution to justify and explain the delay. At the same time, it is the duty of the Court to weigh all the circumstances of a given case before pronouncing upon the complaint. 11. An objection based on denial of right to speedy trial and for relief on that account should first be addressed to the High Court. Even if the High Court entertains such a plea ordinarily it should not stay the proceeding except in a case of grave and exceptional nature. Such proceedings in the High Court must, however, be disposed of on a priority basis. Antulay was the Chief Minister of Maharashtra from 1980 to 1982. A private prosecution was initiated against Page 1256 him by the respondent under the Prevention of Corruption Act for various offences alleged to have been committed by him during his tenure as the Chief Minister. As a consequence of this prosecution, Antulay had to resign his office. The prosecution initiated in 1981 had not been complete till December, 1991, when he filed the present writ petition in theSupreme Court under Art. 32. He sought quashing of the prosecution on account of long delay which violated his Fundamental Right to a speedy trial. After stating the propositions, mentioned above, regarding the right of an accused to a speedy trial of his case, the Supreme Court refused to quash the proceedings against Antulay in the instant case. Although the proceedings had started in 1981, and were still continuing in 1991, most of the delay was caused because the accused himself had been raising objections from time to time before the Courts challenging the proceedings against him on one ground or another. Instead, the Court directed an expeditious trial on a day to day basis. The legal position adumbrated by the Supreme Court in Antulay is that the right to speedy trial flows from Art. 21 and encompasses all the stages right from registration of FIR onwards. In Raj Deo Sharma v. State of Bihar (I),58 the Supreme Court has again laid down some additional propositions to serve as guidelines with a view to promote speedy trials for effective enforcement of the right to speedy trial flowing from Art. 21 and recognised by the Supreme Court in Antulay. In Santosh De v. Archana Guha, 59 the Supreme Courtquashed the prosecution on the ground of inordinate delay as the trial for corruption of a government servant was kept pending for 14 years. The case was filed in 1978 against the Director of Mines, Government of Bihar, under the Prevention of Corruption Act. As the Bihar Government refused to give permission to prosecute him, no charge sheet could be filed for several years but the prosecution was kept pending. TheSupreme Court quashed the prosecution saying that the long delay was caused entirely and exclusively because of the default of the prosecution and it has not been able to explain the reasons for delay. The unexplained long delay in commencing trial by itself infringed the right of the accused to speedy trial. In Union of India v. Ashok K. Mitra,60 there was delay in trial but it was not attributable only to the prosecution and the respondent himself had contributed to the delay. Refusing to quash the prosecution in the instant case, the Court observed that the respondent could not be allowed to take advantage of his own wrong and take shelter under 'speedy trial' to escape from prosecution. The Supreme Court has stated in Common Cause,61 that even persons accused of minor offences have to await their trials for long periods. If they are poor and helpless, they languish in jails as there is no one to bail them out. The very pendency of criminal proceedings for long periods by itself operates as an engine of oppression. Accordingly, to protect and effectuate the right to life and liberty of the citizens guaranteed by Art. 21, the Court issued certain general directions for releasing the undertrials on bail or personal bonds where trials had been pending for one year or more. A government employee was prosecuted and convicted on certain charges of corruption. The prosecution started in 1985 on the basis of events which occurred in 1983. In an appeal, the Supreme Court found in 1997 in Mansukhlal,62 that the sanction given by the government for his prosecution was invalid. The Court barred initiation of fresh prosecution against the appellant. The Court observed:63 \"Normally when the sanction order is held to be bad, the case is remitted back to the authority for reconsideration of the matter and to pass a fresh order of sanction in accordance with law.",

    "content": "in the instant case, the incident is of 1983 and, therefore, after a lapse of fourteen years, it will not, in our opinion, be fair and just to direct that the proceedings may again be initiated from the stage of sanction so as to expose the appellant to another innings of litigation and keep him on trial for an indefinitely long period contrary to the mandate of Article 21 of the Constitution which, as part of right to life, philosophizes early end of criminal proceedings through a speedy trial.\" In 1982-83, an FIR was filed against a government employee alleging that he acquired disproportionate assets by misusing his official position. An investigation was undertaken but no prosecution was launched till the year 2000 as the permission for the same was not granted by the government till then. The Supreme Page 1257 Court quashed the proceedings saying that further prosecution would be travesty of justice.64 The Court asserted that under Art. 21, as interpreted in Antulay,65 every citizen has a right of speedy trial of the case pending against him. While the Supreme Court insists on speedy trials, it has refused to set any maximum time-limit within which a trial must be completed as it is not possible to lay down any time schedules for conclusion of criminal trials.66 The Supreme Court has observed recently in Ramachandra:67 \"It is neither advisable, nor feasible, nor judicially permissible to draw or prescribe an outer limit for conclusion of all criminal proceedings\". The right to speedy trial flowing from Art. 21 encompasses all the stages, namely, \"the stage of investigation, inquiry, trial, appeal revision and retrial\".68 (e) LONG PRE-TRIAL CONFINEMENT A very grievous aspect of the present-day administration of criminal justice is the long pre-trial incarceration of the accused persons. The poor persons have to languish in prisons awaiting trial because there is no one to post bail for them. This perpetrates great injustice on the accused person and jeopardizes his personal liberty. Thousands of accused persons languish in jails awaiting trial for their offences.69 Sometimes an undertrial may remain in prison for much longer than even the maximum prison sentence which can be awarded to him on conviction for the offence of which he is accused. This adversely affects the rights of the undertrials who are presumed to be innocent till proven guilty. This also leads to overcrowding in prisons. One reason for this state of affairs is the irrational law regarding bail which insists on financial security from the accused and their sureties and, thus, the poor and indigent persons cannot be released on bail as they are unable to provide financial security. Consequently, they have to remain in prison awaiting their trial. Thus, even persons accused of bailable offences are unable to secure bail. The Supreme Court has criticised long incarceration of undertrials, and has sought to rectify the deplorable situation. Commenting on the deplorable situation, the Court has observed: \"It is a crying shame on the judicial system which permits incarceration of men and women for such long periods of time without trial....\" The Court has declared that after the 'dynamic' interpretation of Art. 21 in Maneka Gandhi, there is little doubt that any procedure which keeps such large numbers of people behind bars without trial so long cannot possibly be regarded as \"reasonable, just and fair\" so as to be in conformity with Art. 21. It is necessary that the law enacted by the legislature and as administrered by the Courts must radically change its approach to pre-trial detention and ensure 'reasonable, just and fair' procedure which has creative connotations after Maneka Gandhi's cases.70 The Court has ordered release of many such undertrials as have remained in prison longer than even the maximum punishment which could have been imposed on them for their offences under the law. (f) BAIL The Supreme Court has diagnosed the root cause for long pre-trial incarceration to be the present-day unsatisfactory and irrational rules for bail which insist merely on financial security from the accused and their sureties.71 Many of the undertrials being poor and indigent are unable to provide any financial security. Consequently, they have to languish in prison awaiting their trial. But incarceration of persons charged with non-bailable offences during pendency of trial cannot be questioned as violative of Art. 21 since the same is authorized by law.72 The Court has characterised the system of bail in India as 'antiquated'. It is oppressive and weighted against the poor. Improvement of the system is very necessary as the Court insists in Babu Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh,73 \"...... the issue is one of liberty, justice, public safety and burden on the public treasury, all of Page 1258 which insist that a developed jurisprudence of bail is integral to a socially sensitive judicial process.\" The Court has made the constructive suggestion to change legal provisions for bail so that these provisions need no longer be based merely on financial sureties but that other factors should also be taken into account so that the poor can get their release from the prison pending their trial. The Court has laid down that even under the law as it exists, if the trial Court feels satisfied that an accused has his roots in the community and he is not likely to abscond, it can safely release him on his personal bond without sureties. The Supreme Court has laid down guidelines to enable the lower Courts to determine whether the accused has his roots in the community which would deter him from fleeing from justice. The Court has emphasized: \"......the issue is one of liberty, justice, public safety and burden on the public treasury, all of which insist that a developed jurisprudence of bail is integral to a socially sensitive judicial process....\"74 Imposing unjust or harsh conditions, while granting bail, is violative of Art. 21.75 Ordinarily, in cases under TADA,76 release of undertrials on bail is extremely restricted.",

    "content": "Ordinarily, in cases under TADA,76 release of undertrials on bail is extremely restricted. But the Supreme Court has ruled that even in TADA cases, where there is no prospect of a trial being concluded within a reasonal time, release on bail may be necessary as this can be taken to be embedded in the right to speedy trial under Art. 21. In A. Geetha v. State of Tamil Nadu,77 the Supreme Court has held that the conclusion of the Detaining Authority that the detenu may be released on bail was based on relevant consideration, namely, that in similar cases orders granting bail were passed by various Courts.78 Anticipatory bail is a statutory right and it does not arise out of Art. 21. Anticipatory bail cannot be granted as a matter of right as it cannot be considered as an essential ingredient of Art. 21.79 The Supreme Court has suggested that liberal use of parole be made.80 Parole is conditional release of a prisoner after he has served a part of the sentence imposed on him. (g) MORE CRIMINAL COURTS To ensure speedy trial of undertrials, the Supreme Court has exhorted the State Governments to establish more criminal Courts.81 In this connection, it may be noted that the Law Commission has also suggested that the subordinate judiciary be strengthened in number.82 There should be as many additional Courts as may be needed to make it possible that all arrears be cleared within a period of 3 years. The Supreme Court has again reminded the Central/State Governments recently \"of their constitutional obligation to strengthen the judiciary--quantitatively and qualitatively--by providing requisite funds, manpower and infrastructure.\"83 (h) MAXIMUM IMPRISONMENT The Supreme Court has directed release of all undertrials who have been in jail for periods longer than the maximum term of imprisonment for which they could be sentenced if convicted of the offence charged.84 The Court has also directed that the undertrial prisoners, who are accused of multiple offences and who have already been in jail for the maximum term for which they could be sentenced on conviction, even if the sentences awarded to them were consecutive and not concurrent, should be released forthwith, since their continued detention clearly violates not only human dignity but also their Fundamental Right under Art. 21 of the Constitution.85 (i) RIGHT OF APPEAL As a part of the concept of 'fair procedure' in Article 21, the Supreme Court has emphasized that one right of appeal from the Sessions Court to the High Court is essential where criminal conviction is brought about with long loss of liberty.86 Page 1259 (j) LEGAL AID The Supreme Court has taken a big innovative step forward in humanising the administration of criminal justice by suggesting that free legal aid be provided by the State to poor prisoners facing a prison sentence. When an accused has been sentenced by a Court, but he is entitled to appeal against the verdict, he can claim legal aid; if he is indigent and is not able to afford the counsel, the State must provide a counsel to him. The Court has emphasized that the lawyer's services constitute an ingredient of fair procedure to a prisoner who is seeking his liberation through the Court's procedure.87 Bhagwati, J., has observed in Hussainara.88 \"Now, a procedure which does not make available legal services to an accused person who is too poor to afford a lawyer and who would, therefore, have to go through the trial without legal assistance, cannot possibly be regarded as 'reasonable, fair and just\". Thus, the state should provide free legal aid to a prisoner who is indigent or otherwise disabled from securing legal assistance where the ends of justice call for such service.89 The Supreme Court has reiterated this theme of providing legal aid to poor prisoners facing prison sentences again and again. For example, in Hussainara,90 the Court has observed: \"It is an essential ingredient of reasonable, fair and just procedure to a prisoner who is to seek his liberation through the Court's process that he should have legal services available to him.\" Providing free legal service to the poor and the needy is an essential element of any \"reasonable, fair and just procedure.\"91 The Court has exhorted the Central and State Governments to introduce a comprehensive legal service programme in the country. In support of this suggestion, the Court has also invoked Art. 39A which provides for free legal aid,92 and has interpreted Art. 21 in the light of Art. 39A. Art. 39A lays stress upon legal justice. Put simply, the directive requires the State to provide free legal aid to deserving people so that justice is not denied to any one merely because of economic disability. The Court has emphasized that legal assistance to a poor or indigent accused who is arrested and put in jeopardy of his life or personal liberty is a constitutional imperative mandated not only by Art. 39A but also by Arts. 14 and 21. In the absence of legal assistance, injustice may result. Every act of injustice corrodes the foundations of democracy. The Court has upheld the right to free legal aid to be provided to the poor accused persons \"not in the permissive sense of Art. 22(1)93 and its wider amplitude but in the peremptory sense of Art. 21 confined to prison situations.\" In Khatri v. State of Bihar,94 (II), the Supreme Court again emphasized that the State Governments cannot avoid their constitutional obligation to provide free legal service to the poor accused by pleading financial or administrative inability. The obligation to provide free legal service to a poor accused arises not only when the trial begins but also when he is for the first time produced before the magistrate. It is at that stage that the accused gets his first opportunity to apply for bail and obtain his release as also to resist remand to police or jail custody and so the accused needs competent legal advice and representation at that stage.",

    "content": "obligation to provide free legal service to a poor accused arises not only when the trial begins but also when he is for the first time produced before the magistrate. It is at that stage that the accused gets his first opportunity to apply for bail and obtain his release as also to resist remand to police or jail custody and so the accused needs competent legal advice and representation at that stage. The accused can also claim free legal aid after he has been sentenced by a Court, but is entitled to appeal against the verdict. The Court has further emphasized that it is the legal obligation of the magistrate or judge before whom the accused is produced to inform him that if he is unable to engage a lawyer on account of poverty or indigence, he is entitled to obtain free legal services at the cost of the State. The Court has taken the view that the right to free legal services would be illusory for an indigent accused unless the trial judge informs him of such right. Since more than 70% of the people in the rural area are illiterate, and even more than that percentage of people are unaware of the rights conferred on them by law, it is essential to promote legal literacy as part of the programme of legal aid. It would be a mockery of legal aid if it were to be left to the poor ignorant and illiterate accused to ask for free legal services. \"Legal aid would become a paper promise and it would fail in Page 1260 its purpose\". The trial judge is therefore obligated to inform the accused that if he is unable to engage a lawyer on account of poverty or indigence, he is entitled to obtain free legal services at the cost of the State.1 The Court has further explained the question of providing free legal aid to the accused persons in Suk Das.2 It is an essential ingredient of reasonable, fair and just procedure to a prisoner who is to seek his liberation through the Court's process that he should have legal service available to him.3 Therefore, free legal assistance at State cost is a Fundamental Right of a person accused of an offence which may involve jeopardy to his life or personal liberty and his Fundamental Right is implicit in the requirement of \"reasonable, fair and just procedure prescribed by Art. 21\". There may, of course, be some cases involving offences, such as, economic offences or offences against the law prohibiting prostitution or child abuse and the like, where social justice may require that free legal service may not be provided by the state. In Suk Das,4 the appellants and four other persons were charged with an offence under S. 506 read with S. 34 of IPC. The appellants being poor could not engage a lawyer to represent them at the trial. They were convicted by the sessions Court. On appeal to the High Court, they pleaded that they had not been given the assistance of a lawyer but the High Court dismissed the appeal on the ground that they had made no request for legal aid and that in the facts and circumstances of the case it could not be said that the failure to provide them legal assistance vitiated the trial. The matter then came before the Supreme Court by way of appeal. The main question for the Court to consider in Suk Das was whether this Fundamental Right could be denied lawfully to an accused person if he does not apply for free legal aid. The Court has now pointed out that the bulk of the Indian people living in rural areas are illiterate and are not aware of their rights. Even literate people do not know what their rights are under the law. In the circumstances, it would make a mockery of legal aid if it were to be left to a poor, ignorant and illiterate accused to ask for free legal service. \"Legal aid would be an idle formality if it was to depend upon a specific application by such poor or ignorant person for such legal assistance.\" The Court has reiterated the Khatri5 ruling in which it was held that in a case where on conviction a sentence of imprisonment would be imposed and social justice requires that the accused be given legal aid, the magistrate is under a legal obligation to inform the accused that if he is unable to engage the services of a lawyer due to poverty or indigence, he is entitled to obtain free legal service at the cost of the State. In Suk Das, the conviction of the appellant was quashed by the Supreme Court because the accused remained unrepresented by a lawyer and so the trial became vitiated on account of a fatal constitutional infirmity. The Supreme Court has thus ruled that the trial judge is under an obligation to inform the accused that if he is unable to engage the services of a lawyer on account of poverty or indigence, he is entitled to obtain free legal services at the cost of the state. Failure on the part of the trial judge to inform the accused that he is entitled to free legal aid and inquire from whom whether he wants a lawyer to be provided at the state cost amounts to violation of the Fundamental Right of the accused and, thus, the trial is vitiated on account of a fatal constitutional infirmity which means that his conviction must be set aside. The Supreme Court has now clarified that free legal assistance at the cost of the State is a Fundamental Right of a person accused of an offence involving jeopardy to his life or personal liberty. This requirement is implicit in the requirement of a reasonable, fair and just procedure prescribed by Art. 21.",

    "content": "Supreme Court has now clarified that free legal assistance at the cost of the State is a Fundamental Right of a person accused of an offence involving jeopardy to his life or personal liberty. This requirement is implicit in the requirement of a reasonable, fair and just procedure prescribed by Art. 21. The Court has sought to exclude from this requirement cases involving economic offences against law prohibiting prostitution or child abuse or the like. In this connection, the interesting case of Ranjan Dwivedi6 may be noted here. In this case, the real bone of contention was that under the rules of the Delhi High Court, only a daily fee of Rs. 24/- per day was payable to a lawyer appearing as amicus curiae. Ranjan argued that for such a paltry sum, no lawyer of standing would find it possible to appear for him. The prosecution was being conducted by senior lawyers and, therefore, Ranjan argued that as a matter of processual fair play, the state should provide him with a lawyer on the basis of equal opportunity. The Supreme Court agreed with his contention and enhanced the fee payable to Rs. 500/- per day for the senior counsel and Rs. 350/- per day for a junior counsel for Page 1261 representing Ranjan. The Court has directed all State Governments to make provisions for grant of free legal service to the poor accused persons. \"The only qualification would be that the offence charged against that accused is such that, on conviction, it would result in a sentence of imprisonment and is of such a nature that the circumstances of the case and the needs of social justice require that he should be given free legal representation. There may be cases involving offences such as economic offences or offences against law prohibiting prostitution or child abuse and the like, where social justice may require that free legal services need not be provided by the State.\"7 The Supreme Court has however ruled that the remedy for an accused being tried for murder to get proper legal aid was not to come before the Supreme Courtby way of writ petition under Art. 32, but to apply to the sessions Court under S. 304(1) , Cr.P.C.8 In Poolpandi,9 the Supreme Court has rejected the argument that on the basis of Art. 21, a person can claim the presence of his lawyer when he is being questioned by the customs authorities. It was argued that this would be \"just fair and reasonable\" procedure. The person being questioned is not an accused and he could not thus claim the right available to an accused of being heard through his own counsel. (k) HANDCUFFING OF UNDER-TRIALS The Supreme Court has also bestowed its benign attention on questions of maltreatment of undertrials and convicted prisoners. Here the guiding motto of the Court has been: imprisonment does not ipso facto mean that Fundamental Rights desert the prisoner. The Supreme Court has declared in Prem Shankar,10 that hand-cuffing is prima facie \"inhuman, and, therefore, unreasonable is over-harsh and at the first flush, arbitrary\". Accordingly, the Court has held that a rule requiring every undertrial person accused of a non-bailable offence punishable with more than 3 years' prison term to be routinely handcuffed during transit from prison to Court for trial violates Arts. 14, 19 and 21. The nature of the accusation is not the criterion; the clear and present danger of escape, breaking out of the police control is the determinant. The only circumstance validating handcuffing is that there is no other reasonable way of preventing his escape in the given circumstances. And for this, there must be clear material, not glib assumption, record of reasons and judicial oversight, and summary hearing and direction by the trial Court where the victim is produced. Even in cases where, in extreme circumstances, handcuffs have to be put on the prisoner, the escorting authority must record contemporaneously the reasons for doing so. These reasons must get the approval of the presiding judge. Otherwise, there is no control over possible arbitrariness in applying handcuffs and fetters. The Supreme Court has emphasized: \"This is implicit in Art. 21 which insists upon fairness, reasonableness and justice in the very procedure which authorises stringent deprivation of life and liberty.\" According to Krishna Iyer, J., Art. 21 now \"the sanctuary of human values prescribes fair procedure and forbids barbarities, punitive or processual\". While conceding that prevention of escape of a prisoner was in public interest and reasonable, fair and just, Iyer, J., asserted that \"insurance against escape does not compulsorily require handcuffing.\"11 The Court has declared it to be a constitutional mandate that no prisoner is to be handcuffed or fettered routinely or merely for the convenience of the custodian or the Courts. The distinction between classes of prisoners becomes constitutionally obsolete for this purpose as it cannot be assumed that a rich criminal or undertrial is any different from a poor undertrial in the matter of security risk. To be consistent with Arts. 14 and 19, handcuffs must be the last refuge, not the routine regimen. Binding of the accused by the police while in police custody violates Art. 21.12 The Court declared in Prem Shankar:13 \"We hereby declare......that the rule, regarding a prisoner in transit between the prison house and Court house, is Page 1262 freedom from handcuffs and the exception, under conditions of judicial supervision we have indicated earlier will be restraints with irons to be justified before or after. We mandate the judicial officer before whom the prisoner is produced to interrogate the prisoner, as a rule, whether he has been subjected to handcuffs or other 'irons' treatment and, if he has been, the official concerned shall be asked to explain the action forthwith in the light of this judgment\".",

    "content": "the above ruling in Citizens for Democracy Through its President v. State of Assam,14 the Court has directed that \"handcuffs or other fetters shall not be forced on a prisoner-convicted or under-trial while lodged in a jail anywhere in the country or while transporting or in transit from one jail to another or from jail to Court and back\". The police and jail authorities, on their own, shall have no authority to direct handcuffing of any one without the order of a magistrate for the purpose. (l) POLICE TORTURE Life or personal liberty includes a right to live with human dignity. There is an inbuilt guarantee against torture or assault by the State or its functionaries. Torture, assault and death in custody raise serious questions about the credibility of the rule of law and administration of the criminal justice system. There has been increase in instances of custodial violence/torture attributed to misuse of police machinery by those at the helm of affairs to settle personal scores.15 The Supreme Court has in several cases condemned police brutality and torture on prisoners, accused persons and undertrials. In this connection, the Supreme Court has observed in Raghubir Singh v. State of Haryana\" .16 \"We are deeply disturbed by the diabolical recurrence of police torture resulting in a terrible scare in the minds of common citizens that their lives and liberty are under a new peril when the guardians of the law gore human rights to death.\" The Supreme Court has stressed that police torture is \"disastrous to our human rights awareness and humanist constitutional order.\" The Court has squarely placed the responsibility to remedy the situation on the State. In the words of the Court: \"The States, at the highest administrative and political levels, we hope, will organize special strategies to prevent and punish brutality by police methodology. Otherwise, the credibility of the rule of law in our Republic vis-a-vis the people of the country will deteriorate.\" In Francis Coralie Mullin v. Union Territory of Delhi,17 the Supreme Court has condemned cruelty or torture as being violative of Art. 21 in the following words: \"...any form of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment would be offensive to human dignity and constitute an inroad into this right to live and it would, on this view, be prohibited by Article 21 unless it is in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law, but no law which authorises and no procedure prescribed by law, which leads to such torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading element can never stand the test of reasonableness and non-arbitrariness it would be plainly unconstitutional and void as being violative of Articles 14 and 21. It would be seen that there is implicit in Article 21 the right to protection against torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment which is enunciated in Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and guaranteed by Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\" In Sheela Barse,18 the Court has given directions to ensure protection against torture and maltreatment of women in police lock-up. For example, there should be separate lock-ups for female suspects guarded by female constables; interrogation of females should be carried out only in the presence of female constables. The incidents of brutal police behaviour towards persons detained on suspicion of having committed a crime is a common occurrence in India. There has been public outcry from time to time against custodial deaths. The Supreme Court has now ruled that it is a well-recognized right under Art. 21 that a person detained lawfully by the police is entitled to be treated with dignity befitting a human being and that legal detention does not mean that he could be tortured or beaten up. If it is found that the police has ill-treated a detenu, he would be entitled to monetary compensation under Art. 21.19 Page 1263 The Court has given an expansive definition of \"torture\". According to the Court, \"torture is not merely physical but may even consist of mental and psychological torture calculated to create fright to make her submit to the demands of the police\".20 (m) PRISON ADMINISTRATION In the post-Maneka era, in a catena of cases, the Supreme Court has exposed the cruelty of the system of Prison Administration in India, and has sought to humanize it. The Court has taken an active interest in seeking to improve a system which is cruel and insensitive to human pain and suffering. In the process, the scope of the Fundamental Right of personal liberty guaranteed by Art. 21 has been broadened. Time and again, the Supreme Court has emphasized that Arts. 14, 19 and 21 \"are available to prisoners as well as freemen. Prison walls do not keep out Fundamental Rights\".21 The Court has observed in this connection:22 \"A prisoner, be he a convict or under-trial or a detenu, does not cease to be a human being. Even when lodged in the jail, he continues to enjoy all his Fundamental Rights including the right to life guaranteed to him under the Constitution. On being convicted of crime and deprived of their liberty in accordance with the procedure established by law, prisoners still retain the residue of constitutional rights.\" The Court has thus adversely commented several times upon certain aspects of prison administration, particularly, the practice of causing physical injury to the prisoners in the name of maintaining discipline.23 The Court has sought to humanise prison administration to some extent through its various pronouncements. The Apex Court has adversely commented upon the practice of causing physical injury to prisoners in the name of prison discipline. The Court has laid great emphasis on the right of a prisoner to the integrity of his physical person and mental personality. The Court starts with the premise that Fundamental Rights do not stop at the prison gates.",

    "content": "Apex Court has adversely commented upon the practice of causing physical injury to prisoners in the name of prison discipline. The Court has laid great emphasis on the right of a prisoner to the integrity of his physical person and mental personality. The Court starts with the premise that Fundamental Rights do not stop at the prison gates. Thus, no personal harm, whether by way of punishment or otherwise, is to be suffered by a prisoner without affording a preventive, or in special cases, post facto remedy before an impartial, competent, available agency. The Court has also stressed the point that the \"goal of imprisonment is not only punitive but restorative, to make an offender a no-offender\". The Court has given several directives to improve many aspects of prison administration and condition of prisoners.24 The Court has also gone into some aspects of the prison administration affecting the prisoners, viz., imposition of solitary confinement and putting on bar-fetters on the prisoners and has severely curtailed the discretion of prison authorities to impose such punishments on prisoners. In Sunil Batra,25 the petitioner, sentenced to death on charges of murder and robbery, was being kept in solitary confinement pending his appeal before the High Court. He filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court under Art. 32. The Court emphasised in Sunil that Article 21 means that \"the law must be right, just and fair, and not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive. Otherwise, it would be no procedure at all and the requirements of Article 21 would not be satisfied. If it is arbitrary it would be violative of Article 14\".26 The Court has stated that resort to oppressive measures to curb political beliefs (the prisoner concerned was a naxalite and, therefore, he was being put in a 'quarantine' and was being put to inhuman treatment) could not be permitted.27 The Court has maintained that the conviction of a person for a crime does not reduce him to a non-person vulnerable to a major punishment imposed by jail authorities without observance of due procedural safeguards. The under-trials are in custody, but not undergoing punitive imprisonment. The Court has frowned upon the practice of keeping prisoners condemned to death sentence in solitary confinement. Apart from Art. 21, the Court has also held it invalid under Art. 20(2).28 A person under death sentence is held in jail custody so that he is available for execution of the death sentence when the time comes. No punitive detention can be imposed on him by jail authorities except for prison offences. He is not to be detained in solitary confinement as it will amount to imposing punishment for the same offence more than once which would be violative of Art. 20(2).29 Page 1264 It is only when a person is under an executable sentence of death, i.e., when the sentence of death has become final and conclusive and which cannot be avoided by any judicial or constitutional procedure, that he may be kept in solitary confinement. Similarly, the Court has ruled that \"bar fetters make a serious in-road on the limited personal liberty which a prisoner is left with\". Such a punishment can be imposed only to secure the \"safe custody of the prisoner\" taking into consideration \"the character, antecedents and propensities of the prisoner\".30 These are the only relevant considerations to determine whether there need be put such fetters on a prisoner. \"The determination of the necessity to put a prisoner in bar fetters has to be made after application of mind to the peculiar and special characteristics of each individual prisoner.\" \"The nature and length of sentence or the magnitude of the crime committed by the prisoner are not relevant for the purpose of determining that question\". The Court has observed: \"[W]e cannot be oblivious to the fact that the treatment of a human being which offends human dignity, imposes avoidable torture and reduces the man to the level of a beast would certainly be arbitrary and can be questioned under Art. 14.\"31 Krishna Iyer, J., was trenchantly critical of the punishments mentioned here. He stated:32 \"I hold that bar fetters are a barbarity generally and, like whipping, must vanish...... We hold that solitary confinement, cellular segregation and marginally modified editions of the same process are inhuman and irrational\". The Supreme Court has strongly deprecated the tendency of continuing to detain persons as criminal lunatics for long periods even after they have become sane. The Court has emphasized that there should be an adequate number of institutions for looking after the mentally sick persons and that the practice of sending lunatics or persons of unsound mind to jail for safe custody is not desirable, because jail is hardly a place for treating such persons.33 The Court has also frowned upon the practice of keeping women in prison without being accused of any crime. These women are kept in prison merely because they happen to be victims of an offence, or they are required for the purpose of giving evidence, or they are in protective custody. In Hussainara III,34 the Court has characterised \"protective custody\" as \"really and in truth nothing but imprisonment\" which violates Art. 21. The Court has directed the government to set up welfare and rescue homes to take care of destitute women and children. In Inder Singh v. State,35 the Supreme Court issued certain directions as to how the jail authorities should treat two youngmen convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, with a view to reforming them. \" Art. 21 of the Constitution is the jurisdictional root for this legal liberalism.\" In Kishor Singh v. State of Rajasthan,36 the Supreme Court again exposed the injustice being perpetrated on the prisoners and how the guidelines laid down by the Court in the Sunil Batra case were being ignored and flouted by the prison administration.",

    "content": "Art. 21 of the Constitution is the jurisdictional root for this legal liberalism.\" In Kishor Singh v. State of Rajasthan,36 the Supreme Court again exposed the injustice being perpetrated on the prisoners and how the guidelines laid down by the Court in the Sunil Batra case were being ignored and flouted by the prison administration. The Court accordingly directed the State Government to convert the Court rulings on prison administration into rules and instructions forthwith so that violation of the prisoners' freedoms could be avoided. The Court emphasized that no solitary confinement and imposition of bar fetters should take place, \"save in the rarest of rare cases and with strict adherence to procedural safeguards. Arts. 14, 19 and 21 operate within the prisons\". Human dignity is not to be ignored even in prisons. The condition of jails is pitiable. To improve the conditions in prisons, the Supreme Court has made several suggestions in Rama Murthy v. State of Karnataka,37 e.g. the Court has emphasized upon reducing overcrowding in prisons and upon giving proper medical care to the prisoners. (n) PRISONER'S GRIEVANCES The Supreme Court has emphasized that a prisoner, whether a convict, under-trial or detenu, does not cease to be a human being and, while lodged in jail, he enjoys all his Fundamental Rights including the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution. Even when a person is convicted and deprived of his liberty in Page 1265 accordance with the procedure established by law, a prisoner still retains the residue of constitutional rights.38 Arts. 14, 19 and 21 \"are available to prisoners as well as freemen. Prison walls do not keep out Fundamental Rights.\"39 The Fundamental Right of an under trial prisoner under Article 21 of the Constitution is not absolute. Such a Fundamental Right is circumscribed by the prison manual and other relevant statutes imposing reasonable restrictions on such right. The respondent as an under trial prisoner was bound to maintain the internal discipline of the jail. A convict has no right to dictate whether guards ought to be posted to prevent escape of prisoners as the same causes no interference with the personal liberty of prisoners or their lawful preoccupations. Therefore, a convict or an under trial who disobeys the law of the land, cannot contend that it is not permissible to transfer him from one jail to another because the Jail Manual does not provide for such transfer.40 The Supreme Court has assumed, under Art. 32,41 jurisdiction to consider prisoners' grievances of ill-treatment. In Charles Sobraj,42 the Court has ruled that it can intervene with prison administration when constitutional rights or statutory prescriptions are transgressed to the injury of the prisoner. In Sunil Batra II, the Court has pointed out that its powers under Art. 32 are free from the rigid restraints of the traditional English writs. Prisoners are persons and have some rights and do not lose their basic constitutional rights. \"Where the rights of a prisoner either under the constitution or under other law are violated the writ power of the Court can and should run to his rescue.\" Thus, prison torture is not beyond the reach of the Supreme Court under Art. 32. For this purpose, the Court treats letters from prisoners as writ-petitions. In Sunil Batra II, the judicial process was set in motion by a letter written by a prisoner to a Judge of the Supreme Court complaining of the brutal attack by the prison staff on a fellow prisoner. Forsaking all procedural formalities, \"since freedom was at stake,\" the letter was treated by the Court as a petition for the writ of habeas corpus.43 The highlight of Sunil Batra II44 is the acceptance by the Supreme Court of the thesis of functional expansion of the writ of habeas corpus in the current millieu. The writ is capable of multiple uses as developed in the American Jurisprudence. The Courts in America have, through the decisional process, brought the rule of law into the prison system.45 The Supreme Court issued a number of guidelines on the administration of prisons and treatment of prisoners by prison authorities. (o) OTHER ASPECTS OF CRIMINAL LAW AND PROCEDURE S. 110 , Cr.P.C., is couched in very flexible and general language and gives a very wide power to the police which can be used to harass poor and innocent persons. TheSupreme Courthas, therefore, directed the magistrates to discharge their duties when trying cases under S. 110 , Cr.P.C., with great responsibility. If the concerned person is already in prison, he should be given the facility of being defended by the counsel at the State expense.46 S. 468 , Cr.P.C., lays down the periods of limitation within which any prosecution must start. TheSupreme Court has emphasized that any prosecution must abide by the period of limitation as prescribed in this section. The object is to bar parties from filing cases after a long time when material evidence may have disappeared. Limitation is also necessary to prevent abuse of Court process by filing vexatious and belated prosecutions long after the date of offence. The object subserves the concept of fairness of trial as enshrined in Art. 21.47 As a result of plea bargaining, the accused pleaded guilty and the trial Court awarded a light sentence. But, on appeal, the sentence was enhanced. The Supreme Court in Thippaswamy v. State of Karnataka48 objected to the enhancement of the sentence by the appellate Court. The Court emphasized that it would be violative of Art. 21 to induce or lead an accused to plead guilty under an assurance that he would be let off lightly and then in appeal or revision, to enhance the sentence. If the appellate Court feels that the sentence is disproportionately low, it should set aside the conviction and remand the case for trial so that the accused Page 1266 can defend himself if he so wishes.",

    "content": "would not be reasonable, fair, just to act on the plea of guilty for the purpose of enhancing the sentence.\" It has been observed that a right of an accused to watch the prosecution witnesses deposing before a court of law has not yet been accepted as a Fundamental Right within the meaning of Article 21 of the Constitution of India by the Indian Courts. In the absence of such an express provision in the Constitution, and, as such, one has to proceed on the premise that such a right is only of a statutory character.49 G. DEATH SENTENCE (a) CONSTITUTIONALITY The question of constitutional validity of death sentence has been raised before the Supreme Court several times vis-a-vis Arts. 14, 19 and 21. Art. 19 deals with several freedoms but not directly with the freedom to live. It was argued in Jagmohan50 that the right to live is basic to the enjoyment of all these freedoms and, therefore, freedom to live could not be denied by a law unless it is reasonable and in public interest. The Court's response to this argument was that assuming the argument to be correct, S. 302,I.P.C., which prescribes death sentence for murder passes this test. The Law Commission in its 35th report has also favoured retaining the death sentence in India and, therefore, it is difficult to say that capital sentence as such is unreasonable or not in public interest. Adequate procedural safeguards have been provided to the accused under the Criminal Procedure Code. It was further argued against the constitutional validity of awarding a death sentence that the procedure laid down in the Criminal Procedure Code is limited only to the finding of guilt. After the accused is found guilty of the offence of murder, no procedure is laid down for trial of the factors and circumstances crucial for making the choice by the Judge between awarding capital sentence or life imprisonment. The Court rejected this argument as well holding that it is not unreasonable to leave discretion with the judge to sentence an accused convicted for murder either to death or to life imprisonment. It is also not invalid under Art. 14. All relevant facts and circumstances are brought on record during the trial of the accused. The judge balances a number of aggravating or mitigating circumstances of the case and records his reasons in writing for awarding the sentence. It is not possible to lay down the standards through legislation in this regard. Judicial discretion can be corrected by superior Courts. The Supreme Court again upheld the constitutional validity of the death penalty in Rajendra Prasad v. State of Uttar Pradesh .51 The Court did agree with the proposition that, as death penalty finally deprives the accused of his right to life and other Fundamental Rights, the validity of such a punishment can be tested with reference to Arts. 14, 19 and 21. Art. 21 guarantees fair procedure; Art. 19 is based on reasonableness of deprivation of freedom to live and exercise the seven liberties guaranteed therein; Art. 14 is an assurance of non-arbitrary and civilized punitive treatment. Art. 14 ensures that principled sentences of death, not arbitrary or indignant capital penalty, shall be imposed. Art. 14 bars unusual cruelty which spells arbitrariness. Ordinarily, for murder, a life-term would be appropriate save where special reasons exist for imposing death penalty. Death sentence should be imposed only if otherwise public interest, social defence and public order would be smashed irretrievably. \"Special reasons\" necessary for imposing death penalty must relate, not to the crime, as such, but to the criminal. The crime may be shocking and yet the criminal may not deserve death penalty. The extreme penalty can be invoked only in extreme situations.\" Because of some difference in the views expressed by the Supreme Court Judges in Jagmohan and Rajendra, the question of the reasonableness of the death penalty was again raised before the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab .52Again the Court opined by a majority that the provision of death penalty, as an alternative punishment for murder in S. 302 , Penal Code, is not unreasonable and is in public interest. Therefore,S. 302 does not violate the letter or the ethos of Art. 19. The Court even went on to assert that penal laws which define offences and prescribe punishments for the commission of offences do not attract Art. 19(1) as these are not laws having a direct impact on the rights conferred by Art. 19(1). A law is hit by Art. 19 if the \"direct and inevitable consequence\" of such law is to take Page 1267 away or abridge any of the freedoms guaranteed by Art. 19(1). \"If the impact of the law on any of the rights under Art. 19(1) is merely incidental, indirect, remote or collateral and is dependent upon factors which may or may not come into play, the anvil of Art. 19 will not be available for judging its validity.\" No right conferred under Art. 19(1) confers the freedom to commit murder. Deprivation of freedom consequent upon an order of conviction and sentence is \"not a direct and inevitable consequence of the penal law\" but \"is merely incidental to the order of conviction and sentence which may or may not come into play\". i.e. which may or may not be passed. In pith and substance, penal laws do not attract Art. 19(1) as these laws do not deal with the subject-matter of Art. 19(1). Therefore, S. 302,I.P.C., does not have to stand the test of Art. 19(1). The Court further went on to assert that even ifS. 302,I.P.C. were to satisfy the requirements of reasonableness and public interest under Art. 19, the State had discharged that burden. In this connection, the Court referred to the 35th report of the Law Commission in which the Commission had supported the continuance of the death sentence.",

In this connection, the Court referred to the 35th report of the Law Commission in which the Commission had supported the continuance of the death sentence. The provision of death penalty as an alternative punishment for murder is also not violative of Art. 21. This Article clearly brings out the implication that the founding fathers recognised the right of the State to deprive a person of his life or personal liberty in accordance with fair, just and reasonable procedure established by valid law. The procedure provided in the Criminal Procedure Code for imposing capital punishment for murder cannot be said to be unfair, unreasonable and unjust. The Court, however, emphasized that the death penalty is an exception rather than the rule and it ought to be imposed only in the 'gravest of cases of extreme culpability', or in the 'rarest of rare' cases when the alternative option is unquestionably foreclosed. Bhagwati, J., dissenting from the majority ruled that under Art. 19, the onus to prove reasonableness of any restriction on the guaranteed rights is on the State which is also to show that the restriction falls within the permitted category. In his view, the State had failed to discharge this onus. Bhagwati, J., also maintained that the sentence imposed must be proportional to the offence. A sentence which is disproportionate to the offence is arbitrary and irrational under Arts. 14, 19 and 21. On the basis of the arguments against the death sentence, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the death sentence is totally arbitrary and unreasonable. He held S. 302 , I.P.C., andS. 354(3),Cr.P.C., as being violative of Arts. 14 and 21, because these provisions confer an unguided and standardless discretion on the Court whether to liquidate an accused or let him live and the vesting of such discretion in the Court render the death penalty arbitrary or freakish.53 The Supreme Court In Allauddin Mian v. State of Bihar,54 rejected the plea that Bachan Singh needs reconsideration by the Court. In Machhi Singh v. State of Punjab,55 the Supreme Court has emphasized that death penalty need not be inflicted except in the \"gravest of cases of extreme culpability\" and that \"life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is an exception\". The Court has emphasized that death sentence is to be imposed only when \"life imprisonment appears to be an altogether inadequate punishment having regard to relevant circumstances of crime, and provided, and only provided, the option to impose sentence of imprisonment for life cannot be conscientiously exercised having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and all the relevant circumstances.\" Further, the Supreme Court has formulated broad guidelines for determining the \"rarest of rare cases\" in which murderers should be awarded the death penalty instead of life imprisonment. The judges must ask themselves two questions for deciding whether a murder case falls in the category of \"rarest of rare cases\": (1) Whether there is something uncommon about the crime which renders a life imprisonment sentence inadequate and calls for a death sentence? (2) Whether \"the circumstances of the crime are such that there is no alternative but to impose the death sentence even after according maximum weightage to the mitigating circumstances which speak in favour of the offender? \"The judges must draw up a balance-sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances.\"56 In Attorney General of India v. Lachma Devi, 57 the Supreme Court has ruled that execution of a death sentence by public hanging would be barbaric practice and it clearly contravenes Art. 21. It is a revolting practice harking Page 1268 back to earlier centuries. The Court has made it crystal clear that a barbaric crime attracting death sentence does not have to be visited with a barbaric penalty such as public hanging. If any Jail Manual of any State prescribes public hanging then the Supreme Court would declare such provision as void, unconstitutional and violative of Art. 21 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has in Allauddin Mian,58 reiterated the proposition that \"only in those exceptional cases in which the crime is so brutal diabolical and revolting as to shock the collective conscience of the community, would it be permissible to award the death sentence.\"59 In Surja Ram v. State of Rajasthan,60 the appellant killed his real brother, his two minor sons, aunt and nearly killed his brother's wife and daughter while asleep. There was no provocation for the ghastly act. The Supreme Court refused to interfere with the death sentence passed on him by the sessions judge and the High Court. The Supreme Court observed \"... it appears to us that for deciding just and appropriate sentence to be awarded for an offence, the aggravating and mitigating factors and circumstances in which a crime has been committed are to be delicately balanced in a dispassionate manner\"61, and that \"Punishment must also respond to the society's cry for justice against the criminal.62 (b) DELAYED EXECUTION OF DEATH SENTENCE Another principle evolved by the Supreme Court in relation to death sentences is that if there is prolonged delay in execution of a death sentence then it would be an \"unjust, unfair and unreasonable\" procedure to execute the sentence. Prolonged delay in the execution of death sentence is dehumanizing and deprives a person of his life is an unjust, unfair and unreasonable way so as to offend Art. 21.63 In Vatheeswaran v. State of Tamil Nadu,64 the Court thought that the delay of two years would make it unreasonable to execute death sentence. The cause of delay was immaterial. The accused himself may be responsible for the delay.",

    "content": "delay in the execution of death sentence is dehumanizing and deprives a person of his life is an unjust, unfair and unreasonable way so as to offend Art. 21.63 In Vatheeswaran v. State of Tamil Nadu,64 the Court thought that the delay of two years would make it unreasonable to execute death sentence. The cause of delay was immaterial. The accused himself may be responsible for the delay. In such a case, the appropriate relief would be to vacate the death sentence and substitute life imprisonment instead. But, in Sher Singh v. State of Punjab,65 the Supreme Court reconsidered the matter and changed its view somewhat. Sher Singh was sentenced to death in 1978. In 1983, he moved a writ petition in the Supreme Court (following Vatheeswaran) arguing that since there was a delay exceeding two years in executing death sentence on him, it should be set aside. Much of the delay in executing the death sentence occurred because Sher Singh moved a number of infructuous writ petitions. The Court accepted the view that \"the jurisprudence of the civilized world has recognised and acknowledged that prolonged delay in executing a sentence of death can make the punishment when it comes inhuman and degrading\", and that \"prolonged delay in the execution of a death sentence is unquestionably an important consideration for determining whether the sentence should be allowed to be executed.\" The implication of Art. 21 is that a prisoner who has experienced living death for years on end is entitled to come to the Court requesting it to examine the question whether, after all the agony and torment he has been subjected to, it is just and fair to allow the sentence of death to be executed. In Vatheeswaran, the delay exceeding two years was held to be sufficient to quash the death sentence. The Court differed from the Vatheeswaran view and now ruled that \"no hard and fast rule\" can be laid down as regards how much delay should be there in executing the death sentence before it can be commuted. Ordinarily four to five years elapse between imposition of death sentence by the sessions Court and the disposal of the special leave petition by the Supreme Court. Then time is taken for disposal of mercy petitions (under Art. 72 or 161 or under Ss. 432 and 433, Cr. P.C.) by the President or the Governor.66 There can thus be \"no absolute or unqualified rule\", that in every case where there is a long delay in executing the death sentence, that sentence ought to be substituted by the sentence of life imprisonment. The Court has to consider several factors before deciding whether a death sentence should be vacated. The Court must also find out why the delay was caused and who was responsible for it. Every case has to be decided upon its own facts. In Munawar Harum v. State of Maharashtra,67 the Supreme Court refused to commute the death sentence even though it had not been executed for over five years as the petitioners were themselves responsible for Page 1269 this lapse of time. The Court said: \"Such lapse of time is not decisive of the matter but would be a factor to be borne in mind\". On the other hand, in Javed Ahmed v. State of Maharashtra,68 the Court commuted the death sentence to life imprisonment in the following circumstances: he was a youngman of 22; he was repentant for his crime and there was nothing adverse regarding his conduct and behaviour in jail; the death sentence had been hanging on his head for 2 years and 9 months. The bench expressed dissatisfaction that a bench of the Court in Sher Singh should have purported to have overruled the Vatheeswaran case, a decision of another bench. In Triveniben v. State of Gujarat,69 the Supreme Court again reaffirmed the constitutional validity of the death sentence and sought to resolve the conflict of judicial views expressed in Vatheeswaran and Sher Singh. In Vetheeswaran, the Court had said that a delay exceeding two years in executing a death sentence should be sufficient to entitle the condemned person to invoke Art. 21 and demand quashing of the death sentence. On the other hand, in Sher Singh, the Court said that delay alone is not good enough for commutation of a death sentence and that a two-year rule could not be laid down in cases of delay. In Javed Ahmad, the sentence of death was commuted by the Court as the condemned man had suffered more than two years and nine months with the sentence of death heavily weighing on his mind. It was because of this controversy that the matter was referred to a five-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court. The Court considered in detail the following questions in Triveniben: (a) Delay in execution of death sentence; (b) What should be the starting point for computing the delay? (c) What are the rights of a condemned prisoner who has been sentenced to death but not executed? and (d) What could be the circumstances which could be considered along with the time that has been taken before the sentence is executed? The Court has now said that the delay which could be considered in considering the question of commutation of death sentence into one of life imprisonment could only be from the date the judgment by the apex Court is pronounced, i.e. when the judicial process comes to an end. While considering the question of delay after the final verdict is pronounced, the time spent on petitions for review and repeated mercy petitions at the instance of the convicted person himself however shall not be considered. The only delay which would be material for consideration will be the delay in disposal of the mercy petitions or delays occurring at the instance of the Executive. It is expected that the mercy petitions received under Art.",

It is expected that the mercy petitions received under Art. 72 or 161 are disposed of expeditiously by the concerned authorities.70 After the final judicial verdict is pronounced inordinate delay in executing the death sentence coupled with subsequent circumstances could be held to be sufficient to come to a conclusion that execution of death sentence will not be just and proper. On the question of delay, the Court has given the following ruling: \"Undue long delay in execution of the sentence of death will entitle the condemned person to approach this Court under Art. 32 but this Court will only examine the nature of delay caused and circumstances ensued after sentence was finally confirmed by the judicial process and will have no jurisdiction to reopen the conclusions reached by the Court while finally maintaining the sentence of death. This Court, however, may consider the question of inordinate delay in the light of all the circumstances of the case to decide whether the execution of sentence should be carried out or should be altered into imprisonment for life. No fixed period of delay could be held to make the sentence of death in executable and to this extent Vatheeswaran's case cannot be said to lay down the correct law and to that extent stands overruled.\" The Court has thus ruled that if undue long delay occurs in execution of the death sentence, the condemned person can approach it under Art. 32. The Court will examine the nature of the delay caused and the circumstances which ensued after the sentence was finally confirmed. The Court may consider the question of inordinate delay in the light of all the circumstances of the case to decide whether the execution of the sentence should be carried out, or should be altered into imprisonment for life. No fixed period of delay could be held to make the sentence of death non-executable and, to this extent, Vatheeswaran has now been overruled.71 Page 1270 In Madhu Mehta v. Union of India,72 the death sentence of the prisoner was commuted to life imprisonment because of delay in executing it due to inordinate delay in the disposal of mercy petition by President of India. The accused was sentenced to death by the sessions judge on October 19, 1978. The High Court confirmed the death sentence on 28 February, 1979. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal on March 17, 1981. Mercy petition was filed on behalf of the convict by his wife to the President of India on December 18, 1981, but no decision was reached on the petition till August 9, 1989. Thus, the mercy petition had remained pending for eight years. In Shivaji,73 the death sentence was changed into one of life imprisonment because of undue delay in disposal of the mercy petition. A question has been raised whether execution of death sentence by hanging is cruel and inhuman and so unconstitutional.74 The argument has been advanced that Art. 21 bars cruelty and Art. 14 bars unusual cruelty which spells arbitrariness. The Court has ruled that a cruel punishment ought not to be imposed. The Court has unanimously pronounced hanging by rope as a constitutional method to execute the judicially awarded death sentence, and that S. 354(5)of the Criminal Procedure Code which prescribes hanging as the mode of execution lays down \"fair, just and reasonable procedure,\" and does not violate Art. 21. The Central Government has discharged the burden of proof that hanging is the best and the least painful method of carrying out the death sentence and involves no unusual torture or degrading punishment. It is not a cruel method of executing the death sentence. Neither electrocution, nor lethal gas, nor shooting, nor even the lethal injection has \"any distinct or demonstrable advantage\" over the system of hanging. The petitioners challenging the constitutionality of S. 354(5), could furnish no reasons whatsoever as to why the method of hanging is unfair, unjust or unreasonable under Art. 21.75 S. 303,I.P.C., prescribes that if a person under sentence of life imprisonment commits murder, he must be punished with death. TheSupreme Court has ruled in Mithu v. State of Punjab76 that S. 303 is wholly unreasonable and arbitrary and that it violates Art. 21 because the procedure by which S. 303 authorises the deprivation of life is unfair and unjust. The Court has emphasized that the last word on the question of justice and fairness does not rest with the legislature; it is for the Courts to decide whether the procedure prescribed by a law for depriving a person of his life or liberty is fair, just and reasonable. Since there is a fundamental distinction between Ss. 302 and 303 of the I.P.C., the ratio of Bachan Singh does not govern the question as regards the validity of S. 303. WhileS. 302 provides for the death sentence as an alternative, S. 303 prescribes a mandatory death sentence. There is no rational basis for classifying person who commits murder while under life imprisonment as distinguished from others who commit murders while not under life imprisonment, for the purpose of making death sentence mandatory in the former case and optional in the latter case. The classification is based on irrelevant considerations and bears no nexus with the object of the statute, namely, imposition of a mandatory death sentence. S. 433A , Cr.P.C., obligates the actual detention in prison for full 14 years as a mandatory minimum in two classes of cases: (i) where the Court could have punished the offender with death but did not; or (ii) where the Court did punish the culprit with death but his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment underS. 433(a),Cr.",

    "content": "P.C. The section was added to theCriminal Procedure Code in 1978 when Parliament found that persons charged with grave offences inviting death penalty, or persons actually sentenced to death but whose sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, routinely earned remissions under the existing rules and were released from the prison after 4 or 5 years only. Parliament felt outraged by such punitive laxity and thus prescribed imprisonment for 14 years as a mandatory minimum for the two categories of prisoners mentioned above. The Supreme Court has ruled in Maru Ram v. Union of India77 that this is not an arbitrary provision and so is not invalid under Art. 14. Deterrence is a valid punitive component. Even for reformation, a long hospitalization in prison may be necessary. The classification made by the provision in question is not capricious. The Court has also pointed out that Arts. 72 and 161 do not yield to S. 433A,Cr. P.C. Thus, S. 433A , Cr.P.C., does not affect the powers of the President or the Governor under Art. 72 or 161.78 Page 1271 The Court has also rejected the contention that as S. 433A retroactively enlarged punishment, it violated Art. 20(3).79S. 302,I.P.C., speaks of life imprisonment which means life long imprisonment. Therefore, the penalty before and after the enactment ofS. 433A remains the same. Remission vests no right to release when the sentence is life imprisonment. No right to remission has been cancelled as the sentence for life is a sentence for a whole life. Therefore, the mandatory minimum in S. 433A does not amount to an ex post facto enhancement of the period of imprisonment. H. DAMAGES A new judicial trend has manifested itself in the area of personal liberty for sometime now. This is the manifestation of the \"dynamic constitutional jurisprudence\" which the Supreme Court is evolving in this area. The Court can quash an order of detention or arrest if not according to law. The question, however, is whether the Court can award compensation to one who may have unduly suffered detention or bodily harm at the hands of the employees of the State, and whether the victim can move a writ petition for this purpose rather than take recourse to an ordinary civil suit. In Khatri v. State of Bihar,80 (the Bhagalpur Blinding case), it was alleged that the police had blinded certain prisoners and that the State was liable to pay compensation to them. Thus was raised the extremely significant constitutional question, viz: while the Court can certainly injunct the State from depriving a person of his life or personal liberty except in accordance with procedure established by law, but if the State has deprived a person of his life or personal liberty in violation of Art. 21, can the Court grant him relief, or is the Court helpless to grant any such relief to him? Thus, the question was: what relief can the Court give for violation of the constitutional right guaranteed by Art. 21? Bhagwati, J., argued: \"Why should the Court not be prepared to forge new tools and devise new remedies for the purpose of vindicating the most precious of the precious Fundamental Right to life and personal liberty?\"81 The question involved the \"exploration of a new dimension\" of the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed by Art. 21. The important question raised in Khatri was: would the state be liable to pay compensation for acts of its servants outside the scope of their power and authority affecting the life or personal liberty of a person and thus infringing Art. 21? Bhagwati, J., took an affirmative view on this question. He thought that, otherwise, Art. 21 would be reduced to a nullity, 'a mere roap of sand' for 'on this view, if the officer is acting according to law there would be no breach of Art. 21 and if he is acting without the authority of law, the state could argue that it is not responsible for the officer's action and so there is no violation of Art. 21. While not giving a definitive answer to the basic question raised by Bhagwati, J., as an interim measure, in the instant case, the Court ordered the State to meet the expenses of housing these men in a blind home in Delhi. In a precedent-setting judgment in Rudul Shah v. State of Bihar,82 the Supreme Court in a writ petition under Art. 32 awarded Rs. 35,000 as compensation against the State of Bihar to the petitioner because he was kept in jail for 14 years after he had been acquitted by a criminal Court. The facts in Rudul Shah revealed \"a sordid and disturbing state of affairs\" for which the responsibility was squarely on the Administration. He was acquitted by the Court of session, Muzaffarpur, Bihar, in June 1968, but was released from jail only on October 16, 1982. This was done only when a habeas corpus petition was moved on his behalf in the Supreme Court. The State authorities failed to place before the Court any satisfactory material for his continued detention for such a long period. The question before the Supreme Court was whether it could grant some compensation under Art. 32 to the petitioner for his wrongful detention. Under the traditional approach, the only remedy was to file a suit to recover damages from the government, but the difficulties of a suitor filing such a suit are innumerable. The Court felt that if it refused to pass an order of compensation in favour of the petitioner, \"it will be doing merely lip service to the Fundamental Right to liberty which the State Government has so grossly violated\". It will denude the right to life and liberty under Art. 21 of its significant content if the power of the Court were limited merely to passing orders of release Page 1272 from illegal detention.",

    "content": "will denude the right to life and liberty under Art. 21 of its significant content if the power of the Court were limited merely to passing orders of release Page 1272 from illegal detention. The Court went on to observe: \"One of the telling ways in which the violation of that right can reasonably be prevented and due compliance with the mandate of Art. 21 secured, is to mulct the violators in the payment of monetary compensation. Administrative sclerosis leading to flagrant infringements of Fundamental Rights cannot be corrected by any other method open to the judiciary to adopt. The right to compensation is some palliative for the unlawful acts of instrumentalities which act in the name of public interest and which present for their protection the powers of the State as a shield.\"83 The sum ordered by the Court was only an interim measure. It did not preclude the petitioner from suing the State and its officers for appropriate damages. This was a bold departure from the existing legal position, but alarming situations call for new strategies and methods to solve them. As the protector of Fundamental Rights, it is incumbent on the Supreme Court to provide an effective remedy in case such rights are violated. In view of the gross violation of the petitioner's personal liberty for as long as 14 years, had legal technicalities been allowed to stand in the way, it would have amounted to a surrender to State lawlessness, showing cold indifference to the personal liberty of the individual, and his immense sufferings certainly not contemplated by the constitution-makers in the Independent India. Since Rudul Shah, there have been several cases of compensation being awarded to the petitioners for infringement of Art. 21. In Sebastian M. Hongray v. Union of India,84 the Supreme Court issued a writ of habeas corpus requiring the Government of India to physically produce two persons before it. These persons were taken to the military camp by the jawans of the army. The Government failed to produce them expressing its inability to do so. The Court found the explanation given by the Government to be untenable and incorrect. The truth was that these persons had met an unnatural death. In the circumstances, the Supreme Court keeping in view the torture, agony and mental oppression through which the wives of the persons in question had to pass, instead of imposing a fine on the Government for civil contempt of the Court, required that \"as a measure of exemplary costs as is permissible in such cases,\" the Government must pay Rs. one lac to each of the aforesaid two women. The Court declared in the case of Boma Charan Oraon that anyone deprived illegally of his life or personal liberty can come before it and ask for compensation for violation of his Fundamental Right under Art. 21. Oraon as an undertrial prisoner was detained in a lunatic asylum for six years after he had been certified as fit for discharge. The Court awarded him Rs. 15,000 as compensation. The Court observed that no amount could possibly compensate Oraon for living in a lunatic asylum for six years.85 In a number of cases, the Supreme Court has awarded damages to the persons who have been detained illegally by the government, or for death in police custody. In Bhim Singh,86 the Supreme Court awarded compensation to the petitioner for his illegal detention in police custody which was held to constitute violation of his rights under Art. 21 [ Art. 22(2) as well].87 In Saheli,88 the State was held liable to pay compensation to the mother of the deceased who had died because of police beating and assault. In Ravikant,89 damages were awarded by the High Court under Art. 226 for violation of the Fundamental Right under Art. 21 of an undertrial prisoner, who was handcuffed and taken through the streets in a procession by the police during investigation. The Supreme Court upheld the High Court decision. In Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa,90 awarding damages in a case of police custodial death, the Supreme Court has said of Art. 32 that this provision imposes an obligation on the Court \"to forge such new tools which may be necessary for doing complete justice and enforcing the Fundamental Rights guaranteed in the Constitution\". What happened in Nilabati was that the petitioner's son was taken into police custody in connection with the investigation of an offence of theft. Next day his dead body was found on the railway track. The Court treated this as a case of custodial death as the body bore many injury marks. The Court awarded compensation of Rs. 1,50,000/- to the petitioner. A family of seven persons was abducted by the Punjab Police. A habeas corpus petition was filed in the Supreme Court by a family relation for the release of these persons from the police custody. The Government admitted in the Court that these persons were abducted by the police but it was not yet known Page 1273 whether these persons were dead or alive. After a review of the facts, the Court directed the Director of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to investigate the matter personally and make a report to the Court as the Court was \"unwilling to entrust the investigation of the abduction and presumable liquidation of the said seven persons to the Punjab Police\". The Court maintained that \"an independent investigation at a very high level\" was called for.91 Subsequently, the Director, CBI, made the enquiry report as directed by the Court. The Director reported that these seven persons had been liquidated by the police. Consequently, the Court awarded damages amounting to Rs. 1.50 lacs to the legal representative of each of the persons killed. The Court expressed its strong \"disapprobation\" of the conduct of the Punjab Police.1 The Court has explained in Nilabati Behera2 the nature of the remedy thus: award of compensation in a proceeding under Art.",

    "content": "Director reported that these seven persons had been liquidated by the police. Consequently, the Court awarded damages amounting to Rs. 1.50 lacs to the legal representative of each of the persons killed. The Court expressed its strong \"disapprobation\" of the conduct of the Punjab Police.1 The Court has explained in Nilabati Behera2 the nature of the remedy thus: award of compensation in a proceeding under Art. 32 by the Supreme Court, or by the High Court under Art. 226, \"is a remedy available in public law, based on strict liability for contravention of Fundamental Rights to which the principle of sovereign immunity does not apply, even though it may be available as a defence in private law in an action based on tort.\"3 Thus, compensation is available to a victim of State aggression under two heads: (1) As a public law remedy under Arts. 32 and 226 for contravention of Fundamental Rights; (2) As a matter of tortious liability of the State--a topic discussed later.4 Some persons were illegally detained by the Haryana Police. A petition for habeas corpus was moved in the Supreme Court under Art. 32. The Court has emphasized in Dhaman Joy Sharma v. State of Haryana,5 that \"the right of personal liberty of a citizen is all too precious and no one can be permitted to interfere with it except in accordance with the procedure established by law\".6 The State must be held responsible for the unlawful acts of its officers and it must repair the damage to the citizens by its officers.7 The Supreme Court has thus observed in CERC v. Union of India :8 \"It is, therefore, settled law that in public law claim for compensation is a remedy available under Article 32 or 226 for the enforcement and protection of fundamental and human rights. The defence of sovereign immunity is inapplicable and alien to the concept of guarantee of Fundamental Rights. There is no question of defence being available for constitutional remedy. It is a practical and inexpensive mode of redress available for the contravention made by the State, its servants, its instrumentalities, a company or a person in the purported exercise of their powers and enforcement of the rights claimed either under the statutes or licence issued under the statute or for the enforcement of any right or duty under the Constitution or the law.\" The Supreme Court awarded compensation when certain persons picked up by the army disappeared. The case arose under Art. 226 in the Gauhati High Court and came before the Supreme Court by way of appeal. The Manipur Police killed two persons, alleged to be terrorists, in a fake encounter. The Supreme Court held that this could not be done even in a disturbed area. It violates Art. 21 as it is taking away life without any reasonable, fair and just procedure. The State cannot raise the defence of sovereign immunity in such a situation. Accordingly, the Court awarded Rs. 100,000/- to the family of each as compensation.9 A Bangladeshi woman was gang raped by some railway employees. Damages were awarded to her against the Railway Administration in Chairman, Railway Board v. Chandrima Das,10 under Art. 226. The Supreme Court ruled that relief could be granted under Art. 226 as there was violation of Fundamental Right under Art. 21 and not of an ordinary right. A foreigner can claim protection under Art. 21 along with the Indian citizens.11 When there is a communal riot, and someone is injured in person or property, it has now become a practice to award compensation to the person concerned. The theory underlying this practice is that maintenance of law and order is the duty and the responsibility of the government; it cannot abdicate this responsibility and allow life and liberty of the citizens to be put in jeopardy.12 The State is under an obligation to protect the life, liberty and property of its citizens. The State cannot be negligent and careless in protecting the property of the citizens in the aftermath of the riots. Page 1274 I. CUSTODIAL VIOLENCE The incidents of brutal police behaviour towards persons detained on suspicion of having committed crimes is a routine matter. There has been public outcry from time to time against custodial deaths. The Supreme Court has taken a very positive stand against police atrocities, intimidation, harassment and use of third degree methods to extort confession. The Court has characterised all this as being against human dignity.13 The expression 'life' in Art. 21 means right to live with human dignity and this includes a guarantee against torture and assault by the State. The Supreme Court has ruled that it is a well recognised right under Art. 21 that a person detained lawfully by the police is entitled to be treated with dignity befitting a human being and that illegal detention does not mean that he could be tortured or beaten up. Describing police torture as 'disastrous to our human rights awareness and humanist constitutional order', the Supreme Court has held the State responsible for remedying the situation. If police brutality is not checked, \"the credibility of the rule of law in our Republic vis-à-vis the people of the country will deteriorate\". If it is found that the police has ill-treated a detenu, he would be entitled to monetary compensation under Art. 21.14 The Court has often awarded compensation, exemplary damages to the victims of police brutality against the State. Many a time, the Supreme Court has passed strictures against police torture and brutality on prisoners, under-trials and accused persons.",

    "content": "Court has observed in Raghubir Singh v. State of Haryana :15 \"We are deeply disturbed by the diabolical recurrence of police torture resulting in a terrible scare in the minds of common citizens that their lives and liberty are under a new peril when the guardians of the law gore human rights to death.\" The question of custodial deaths, i.e., deaths in police lock-up, and the question of modalities for awarding compensation to the members of the family of the deceased as well as to the victims subjected to police torture, has been considered in depth by the Supreme Court in D.K. Basu v. State of West Bengal .16 Many a time, the police arrests a person without warrant in connection with the investigation of an offence, without recording his arrest. He is then subjected to torture to extract information from him for the purpose of carrying on further investigation. The torture and violence caused to the arrestee sometimes results in his death. After making reference to several reports published on the matter, national and international,17 the Supreme Court has observed that custodial violence strikes a blow at the rule of law. Therefore, it becomes the sacred duty of the Court, \"as the custodian and protector of the fundamental and the basic human rights of citizens\" to deter violations of human rights through police violence in lock ups. In spite of the constitutional and statutory provisions aimed at safeguarding personal liberty and life of a person (viz., Arts. 21 and 22 of the Constitution), \"growing incidence of torture and deaths in police custody has been a disturbing factor.\" The Court has asserted, \"The precious right guaranteed by Art. 21 of the Constitution of India cannot be denied to convicts, undertrials, detenus and other prisoners in custody, except according to the procedure established by law by placing such reasonable restrictions as are permitted by law.\"18 While police is entitled to arrest a criminal and interrogate him during the investigation of an offence, the law does not permit the use of third-degree methods or torture of an accused in custody during interrogation and investigation to solve a crime. The Apex Court has stated in Basu: \"Custodial violence, including torture and death in the lock-ups, strikes a blow at the rule of law, which demands that the powers of the executive should not only be derived from law but also that the same should be limited by law\". The Court has further observed: \"However, in spite of the constitutional and statutory provisions aimed at safeguarding the personal liberty and life of a citizen, growing incidence of torture and deaths in police custody has been a disturbing factor. Experience shows that worst violations of human rights take place during the course of investigation... custodial death is perhaps one of the Page 1275 worst crimes in a civilised society governed by the rule of law...\"19 The Court has pointed out that besides the police there are several other governmental authorities having power to detain persons and interrogate them in connection with the investigation of certain types of offences. Some of these agencies are: Directorate of Enforcement (FERA), Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Central Reserve Police, Intelligence Bureau, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), etc. There are instances of torture and death in custody of these authorities as well.20 The Supreme Court has accordingly issued \"requirements to be followed in all cases of arrest or detention till legal provisions are made in that behalf as preventive measures.\" The Court also opined that failure to comply with these requirements will not only render the concerned official liable for departmental action but also to punishment for contempt of Court. The Court reiterated these 'requirements' in DK Basu v. State of West Bengal,21 II, and required that these requirements be given wide publicity. \"Creating awareness about the rights of the arrestee would in our opinion be a step in the right direction to combat the evil of custodial crime and bring in transparency and accountability.\"22 Of more immediate interest is the question of award of compensation for custodial violence or death in a writ petition under Art. 32 or 226. On this question, the Court has said after referring to Nilabati Behera:23 \"The claim in public law for compensation for unconstitutional deprivation of Fundamental Right to life and liberty, the protection of which is guaranteed under the Constitution, is a claim based on strict liability and is in addition to the claim in private law for damages for tortious acts of the public servants.\" The Court has emphasized that public law proceedings serve a different purpose than the private law proceedings. The purpose of the former \"is not only to civilise public power but also to assure the citizens that they live under a legal system wherein their rights and interests shall be protected and preserved\". On the other hand, civil action for damages is a long drawn and a cumbersome judicial process. The award of compensation in the public law jurisdiction is without prejudice to any other action which is lawfully available to the victims or the heirs of the deceased victim. \"The relief to redress the wrong for the established invasion of the Fundamental Rights of the citizen, under the public law jurisdiction is, thus, in addition to the traditional remedies and not in derogation of them.\"24 J. EXTENDED VIEW OF ART. 21 A very fascinating development in the Indian Constitutional jurisprudence is the extended dimension given to Art. 21 by the Supreme Court in the post-Maneka era. The Supreme Court has asserted that in order to treat a right as a Fundamental Right, it is not necessary that it should be expressly stated in the Constitution as a Fundamental Right. Political, social and economic changes in the country entail the recognition of new rights. The law in its eternal youth grows to meet the demands of the society. Since Maneka Gandhi, Art. 21 has proved to be multi-dimensional. This aspect of Art.",

    "content": "by the Supreme Court in the post-Maneka era. The Supreme Court has asserted that in order to treat a right as a Fundamental Right, it is not necessary that it should be expressly stated in the Constitution as a Fundamental Right. Political, social and economic changes in the country entail the recognition of new rights. The law in its eternal youth grows to meet the demands of the society. Since Maneka Gandhi, Art. 21 has proved to be multi-dimensional. This aspect of Art. 21 is brought out by the following judicial pronouncements. This extension in the dimensions of Art. 21 has been made possible by giving an extended meaning to the word 'life' and 'liberty' in Art. 21. These two words in Art. 21 are not to be read narrowly. These are organic terms which are to be construed meaningfully. The right to life enshrined in Art. 21 has been liberally interpreted so as to mean something more than mere survival and mere existence or animal existence. It therefore includes all those aspects of life which go to make a man's life meaningful, complete and worth living. The Supreme Court has asserted that Art. 21 is the heart of the Fundamental Rights.25 It has enough positive content and is not merely negative in its reach even though Art. 21 is worded in negative terms.26 The Supreme Court has taken the view that in order to treat a right as a Fundamental Right, it is not necessary that it should be expressly stated as a FundamentalRight. Accordingly, the Supreme Court has Page 1276 implied a whole bundle of human rights out of Art. 21 by reading the same along with some Directive Principles.27 Art. 21 is to be read not only with directive principles but also fundamental duties and hence it does not include any right to procreate as many children as one pleases.28 The Court has made orders directing petitioner to be counseled by marriage counselor and affording her police protection and debarred the parents, relatives or husband of petitioner from attempting to communicate or contact the petitioner without prior permission of the Court.29 Another strategy adopted by the Supreme Court with a view to expand the ambit of Art. 21, and to imply certain rights therefrom, has been to interpret Art. 21 along with international charters on Human Rights. For example, in PUCL,30 the Court has implied the right of privacy from Art. 21 by interpreting it in conformity with Art. 12 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and Art. 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966. Both of these international documents provide for the right of privacy; India is a signatory to both and they do not go contrary to any part of Indian municipal law. This kind of judicial approach can be seen in a number of cases cited below.31 From non-deprivation of life to its preservation, from negative to positive content, Art. 21 has been fundamentally transformed as a result of judicial creativity. During the last fifty years, Art. 21 has had quite an eventful journey. A most remarkable feature of expansion of Art. 21 has been that many of the non-justiciable Directive Principles have been converted into enforceable Fundamental Rights by the magical wand of judicial creativity. In the process of expanding the ambit of Art. 21, the Supreme Court has integrated many Directive Principles with Art. 21. The result of this judicial activism has been that not only many Directive Principles have been activated but also many new Fundamental Rights have been implied by the Supreme Court from Art. 21. This becomes clear from the discussion which follows. Article 21 is couched in negative phraseology. But by its creative interpretation of Art. 21 in various cases, the Supreme Court has come to impose positive obligation upon the state to take steps for ensuring to the individual a better enjoyment of his life and dignity, e.g., (1) maintenance and improvement of public health; (2) providing humane conditions in prisons and protective homes; (3) improvement of the environment etc. However, the Court has been careful to point out that individuals rights cannot be absolute in a welfare state. It has to be subservient to the rights of the public at large. Hence financial constraints of the state have also to be considered and recognized when demands for medical and health facilities arise in a welfare state.32 The complaint of violation of the Fundamental Right under Art. 19(1)(a) of the Constitution was considered by the Supreme Court when Doordarshan decided not to telecast a documentary film titled Father, Son and Holy War against communal violence. A selection committee was constituted by Doordarshan to preview the film and according to the Committee the violence depicted in the film would have adverse effect on the minds of the viewers. This decision came up for consideration before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court came to the conclusion that the film maker had a right to convey his perception on the oppression of women, flawed understanding of manhood and evils of communal violence throughout the film. The film, according to the Court, in its entirety had a serious message to convey which was in the present context and Doordarshan, being a state controlled agency funded by public funds, could not have denied access to screen the documentary. (a) QUALITY OF LIFE Apart from improving the administration of criminal justice, the Supreme Court has used Art. 21 in a very creative manner to improve the quality of life and to imply therefrom a bundle of rights for the people. A grand step was taken by the Court in expanding the scope of Art. 21 when it argued that 'life' in Art. 21 does not mean merely 'animal existence' but living with 'human dignity'. The Court has thus given very extensive parameters to Art. 21.",

    "content": "grand step was taken by the Court in expanding the scope of Art. 21 when it argued that 'life' in Art. 21 does not mean merely 'animal existence' but living with 'human dignity'. The Court has thus given very extensive parameters to Art. 21. As the Supreme Court has observed in Francis Coralie:33 Page 1277 \"But the question which arises is whether the right to life is limited only to protection of limb or faculty or does it go further and embrace something more. We think that the right to life includes right to live with human dignity and all that goes along with it, viz., the bare necessities of life such as adequate nutrition, clothing and shelter over the head and facilities for reading, writing and expressing oneself in diverse forms, freely moving about and mixing and mingling with fellow human beings. Of course, the magnitude and content of the components of this right would depend upon the extent of the economic development of the country, but it must, in any view of the matter, include the right to the basic necessities of life and also the right to carry on such functions and activities as constitute the bare minimum expression of the human self.\" Another broad formulation of the theme of life with dignity is to be found in Bandhua Mukti Morcha.34 Characterising Art. 21 as the heart of Fundamental Rights, the Court gave it an expanded interpretation--\"to live with human dignity, free from exploitation. It includes protection of health and strength of workers, men and women, and of the tender age of the children against abuse, opportunities and facilities for children to develop in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity, educational facilities, just and human conditions of work and maternity relief. These are the minimum conditions which must exist in order to enable a person to live with human dignity. No government can take any action to deprive a person of the enjoyment of these basic rights.\" In Chameli Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh,35 the Supreme Court while dealing with Art. 21 has held that the need for a decent and civilized life includes the right to food, water and decent environment. The Court has observed in this connection:36 \"In any organised society, right to live as a human being is not ensured by meeting only the animal needs of man. It is secured only when he is assured of all facilities to develop himself and is freed from restrictions which inhibit his growth. All human rights are designed to achieve this object. Right to live guaranteed in any civilized society implies the right to food, water, decent environment, education, medical care and shelter. These are basic human rights known to any civilized society...\" In CERC v. Union of India,37 the Supreme Court has observed: \"The right to life with human dignity encompasses within its fold, some of the finer facets of human civilization which makes life worth living. The expanded connotation of life would mean the tradition and cultural heritage of the persons concerned.\" Thus, the Supreme Court has introduced a qualitative concept into Art. 21. Whatever promotes quality of life falls within the parameters of Art. 21. The right to life connotes not merely animal existence but includes finer graces of human dignity, culture and civilization. The right to life with human dignity encompasses within its purview some of the finer facets of human civilization which make life worth living. This gives a very expansive dimension to Art. 21. To reach such a result, the Supreme Court in a display of judicial activism has integrated Art. 21 with a number of Directive Principles. This judicial approach has led to two very spectacular results within the last two decades, viz.: (1) Many Directive Principles which, as such, are not enforceable have been activated and have become enforceable.38 (2) The Supreme Court has implied a number of Fundamental Rights from Art. 21. The Supreme Court does not follow the principle that unless a right is expressly stated as a Fundamental Right, it cannot be treated as one. The Supreme Court has asserted that in order to treat a right as a Fundamental Right, it is not necessary that it should be expressly stated as a Fundamental Right in the Constitution. Political, social and economic changes occurring in the country entail the recognition of new rights and the law in its eternal youth grows to meet the demands of the society. In course of time, Art. 21 has come to be regarded as the heart of Fundamental Rights.39 Art. 21 has enough of positive content in it and it is not merely negative in its reach.40 Over time, since Maneka Gandhi, the Supreme Court has been able to imply, by its creative interpretation, several Fundamental Rights out of Art. 21. This has been possible by reading Art. 21 alongwith some Directive Principles. Art. 21 has thus emerged Page 1278 into a multi-dimensional Fundamental Right. (b) RIGHT TO LIVELIHOOD To begin with, the Supreme Court took the view that the right to life in Art. 21 would not include livelihood. In re Sant Ram,41 a case which arose before Maneka Gandhi, the Supreme Court ruled that the right to livelihood would not fall within the expression 'life' in Art. 21. The Court said curtly: \"The argument that the word \"life\" in Art. 21 of the Constitution includes 'livelihood' has only to be stated to be rejected. The question of livelihood has not in terms been dealt with by Art. 21.\" The right to livelihood would be included in the freedoms enumerated in Art. 19, or even in Art. 16, in a limited sense. But the language of Art. 21 \"cannot be pressed into aid of the argument that the word 'life' in Art. 21 includes 'livelihood' also\". The Supreme Court reiterated this proposition in several cases even in the post--Maneka era. Thus, in Nachane,42 the Court reiterated the same proposition without much argument.",

    "content": "The right to livelihood would be included in the freedoms enumerated in Art. 19, or even in Art. 16, in a limited sense. But the language of Art. 21 \"cannot be pressed into aid of the argument that the word 'life' in Art. 21 includes 'livelihood' also\". The Supreme Court reiterated this proposition in several cases even in the post--Maneka era. Thus, in Nachane,42 the Court reiterated the same proposition without much argument. Again, the Court adopted the Sant Ram view in Bapi Raju43 without any elaboration. But then, the view of the Court underwent a change. With the defining of the word 'life' in Art. 21 in a broad and expansive manner, the Court came to hold that 'the right to life' guaranteed by Art. 21 includes the 'right to livelihood.'44 The Supreme Court has now implied the 'right to livelihood' out of the 'right to life' in Art. 21. The Court has argued in Olga Tellis,45 a case which was brought by pavement dwellers to resist eviction from their habitat by the Bombay Municipal Corporation, that the right to livelihood is born out of the right to life, as no person can live without the means of living, that is, the means of livelihood. The Court has observed in this connection:46 \"...... the question which we have to consider is whether the right to life includes the right to livelihood. We see only one answer to that question, namely, that it does. The sweep of the right to life conferred by Art. 21 is wide and far-reaching. It does not mean, merely that life cannot be extinguished or taken away as, for example, by the imposition and execution of the death sentence, except according to procedure established by law. That is but one aspect of the right to life an equally important facet of that right is the right to livelihood because, no person can live without the means of living, that is, the means of livelihood.\" If the right to livelihood is not treated as a part and parcel of the constitutional right to life, the easiest way of depriving a person of his right to life would be to deprive him of his means of livelihood to the point of abrogation.47 The Court has observed on this point: \"The State may not by affirmative action, be compellable to provide adequate means of livelihood or work to the citizens. But, any person who is deprived of his right to livelihood except according to just and fair procedure established by law, can challenge the deprivation as offending the right to life conferred by article 21.\" Deprivation of livelihood would not only denude the life of its effective content and meaningfulness but it would make life impossible to live. And yet such deprivation of life would not be in accordance with the procedure established by law, if the right to livelihood is not regarded as a part of the right to life. Emphasizing upon the close relationship between 'life' and 'livelihood', the Court stated: \"That, which alone makes it possible to live, leave aside what makes life liveable, must be deemed to be an integral component of the right to life. Deprive a person of his right to livelihood and you shall have deprived him of his life.\"48 Referring to the Directive Principles of State Policy, e.g., Arts. 39(a), 37, 41,49 the Court has pointed out that if these Directive Principles obligate the State to secure to the citizens an adequate means of livelihood and the right to work, \"it would be sheer pedantry to exclude the right to livelihood from the content of the right to life. In Olga Tellis, the Supreme Court has ruled that the eviction of a person from pavement or slum inevitably leads to deprivation of his means of livelihood and, therefore, reasonable, fair and just procedure must be followed for the purpose. It will thus be seen that from the traditional concept of right to life, the Court has developed a very significant economic right for the people. In the case noted below,50 the Supreme Court has stated: \"There is no doubt that broadly interpreted and as a necessary logical corollary, right to life would include the right to livelihood and, therefore, right to work. But this is in the context of Art. 21 which seeks to protect persons against deprivation of their life except Page 1279 according to procedure established by law. This does not obligate the State to provide work or livelihood to the people. There is no such positive obligation on the State. This matter falls under the Directive Principle in Art. 41. The Supreme Court has explained the position thus:51 \"This country has so far not found it feasible to incorporate the right to livelihood as a Fundamental Right in the Constitution. This is because the country has so far not attained the capacity to guarantee it, and not because it considers it any the less fundamental to life. Advisedly, therefore, it has been placed in the Chapter on Directive Principles Article 41 of which enjoins upon the State to make effective provision for securing the same 'within the limits of its economic capacity and development.' Thus, even while giving the directions to the State to ensure the right to work, the constitution-makers thought it prudent not to do so without qualifying it.\"52 But the Court has acknowledged that what should be the salary structure to lead a life with human dignity is a difficult exercise and cannot be measured in absolute terms.",

    "content": "the absence of any material on record to show that the salary currently paid is so low that they are not able to maintain their living having regard to the post which they are holding a complaint of violation of Article 21 was not sustained.53 When the land of a landowner is acquired by the State in accordance with the procedure laid down in the relevant law of acquisition, it does adversely affect the right to livelihood of the concerned landowner is not affected. The State acquires land in exercise of its power of eminent domain for a public purpose. The landowner is paid compensation as well as solatium in lieu of land. The right of a landowner must give way to the public purpose and, therefore, \"the plea of deprivation of right to livelihood under Art. 21 is unsustainable\".54 Imams perform religious duties in the mosques. They were not being paid any remuneration for their work. They filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court under Art. 32 claiming that they be paid remuneration. The Court ruled that the right to life enshrined in Art. 21 means the right to live with human dignity. Therefore, the Imams are entitled to get remuneration. The Court rejected the argument of the wakf boards that their financial position is not such that they could cope with the obligation of paying salary to the Imams with the remark that \"financial difficulties of the institution cannot be above Fundamental Rights of a citizen.\" The Court accordingly directed the wakf boards to pay remuneration to the whole time Imams.55 The Supreme Court has ruled in Sivani56 that regulation of video games does not violate Art. 21. It is true that Art. 21 protects livelihood but \"its deprivation cannot be extended too far or projected or stretched to the avocation, business or trade injurious to public interest or has invidious effect on public morale or public order\". Therefore, regulation of video games or prohibition of some video games or pure chance or mixed chance and skill are not violative of Art. 21 nor is the procedure of regulation unreasonable, unfair or unjust. It is true that the owner of the video games earns his livelihood assured under Art. 21 but no one has the right to play with the credulity of the general public or the career of young and impressive age school or college going children by operating unregulated video games. A regulation conferring power on the authority to terminate the services of a permanent and confirmed employee by issuing a notice without assigning any reasons and without giving him a hearing has been held to be wholly arbitrary and violative of Arts. 21 in D.T.C. v. D.T.C . Mazdoor Congress.57 Sawant, J., has explained the position thus:58 \"The right to life includes right to livelihood. The right to livelihood therefore cannot hang on to the fancies of individuals in authority. The employment is not a bounty from them nor can its survival beat their mercy. Income is the foundation of many Fundamental Rights and when work is the sole source of income, the right to work becomes as much fundamental. Fundamental Rights can ill-afford to be consigned to the limbo of undefined premises and uncertain applications. That will be a mockery of them.\" In Anthony,59 the Supreme Courthas insisted that when a government servant or one in a public undertaking is suspended pending the holding of a departmental disciplinary inquiry against him, subsistence allowance must be paid to him. The Court has emphasized that a government servant does not surrender his right to life under Art. 21 or the basic human rights. \"Non-payment of subsistence allowance is an inhuman act which has an unpropitious effect on the life of an employee.\"60 Page 1280 Right to work has not yet been recognised as a Fundamental Right. In Umadevi(3)61 the argument of infringement of Article 21 relying on an expansive interpretation of Art. 21 i.e. the right of employment was not accepted by the Supreme Court and the reason for that was amongst others, that the employees accepted the employment on their own volition and with eyes open as to the nature their employment. The Court also rejected the argument that the right to life under Art. 21 would include the right of employment at the present point of time. (c) SLUM DWELLERS In Olga Tellis,62 the Supreme Court has made a significant pronouncement on the impact of Art. 21 on urbanization. Pavement dwellers were sought to be evicted by the municipality. The problem of pavement dwellers arises because thousands of people migrate from villages to the metropolitan towns and they squat everywhere, even on pavements, and live in a very pitiable condition. The Municipality's case was that no person has any legal right to encroach on a foot-path over which the public has a right of way. The pavement dwellers took recourse to Art. 21 to stall their eviction from the pavements. They argued that their eviction would adversely affect their means of livelihood which is included within Art. 21 and it can only be taken away or abridged by following a fair and reasonable procedure. As has already been noted, the Court accepted the plea that the right to life guaranteed by Art. 21 includes the right to livelihood. The Supreme Court ruled that the eviction of persons from pavement or a slum not only results in deprivation of shelter but would also inevitably lead to deprivation of their means of livelihood which means deprivation of life in as much as the pavement dwellers were employed in the vicinity of their dwellings. \"The conclusion, therefore, in terms of the constitutional phraseology is that the eviction of the petitioners will lead to deprivation of their livelihood and consequently to the deprivation of life.\" However, even if removal of pavement dwellers would lead to deprivation of their 'livelihood', and hence 'life' for purposes of Art. 21, Art.",

    "content": "conclusion, therefore, in terms of the constitutional phraseology is that the eviction of the petitioners will lead to deprivation of their livelihood and consequently to the deprivation of life.\" However, even if removal of pavement dwellers would lead to deprivation of their 'livelihood', and hence 'life' for purposes of Art. 21, Art. 21 does not place an absolute embargo on the deprivation of life or personal liberty. What Art. 21 insists is that such deprivation ought to be according to procedure established by law which should be \"fair, just and reasonable\". Therefore, anyone who is deprived of his right to livelihood without just and fair procedure established by law can challenge deprivation as being against Art. 21. This means that any one who is sought to be evicted by the municipality must be given notice and hearing. The Court accepted the right of the municipality to remove the pavement dwellers from the footpaths over which the public has right of passage. The Court rejected the contention of the squatters that their claim to construct hutments on pavements and that of the pedestrians to use pavements are \"competing claims\" and so the former ought to be preferred to the latter. But, before eviction, the municipality must follow a 'reasonable procedure and give notice and hearing to the squatters except in urgent cases where eviction brooks no delay.63 The question of removal of huts constructed by pavement dwellers over municipal land again arose in Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation v. Nawab Khan Gulab Khan .64 The Supreme Court has ruled that the municipality can remove the huts by following a reasonable procedure. Under Art. 21, a person can be deprived of his life or personal liberty by following reasonable procedure. \"It is for the Court to decide in exercise of its constitutional power of judicial review whether the deprivation of life or personal liberty in a given case is by procedure which is reasonable, fair and just or it is otherwise.\" The Court has emphasized that the Constitution does not put an absolute embargo on the deprivation of life or personal liberty but such a deprivation must be according to the procedure, in the given circumstances, fair and reasonable. \"To become fair, just and reasonable, it would not be enough that the procedure prescribed in law is a formality.\"65 (d) HAWKERS While hawkers have a Fundamental Right under Art. 19(1)(g) to carry on trade or business of their choice, they have no right to do so at a particular place. They cannot be permitted to carry on their trade on every road in the city. If the road is not wide enough to conveniently accommodate the traffic on it, no hawking may Page 1281 be permitted at all, or may be permitted once a week, say on Sunday, when the rush considerably thins out. Footpaths, streets or roads are public property and are intended to several general public and are not meant for private use.66 (e) RIGHT TO MEDICAL CARE In Parmanand Katara v. Union of India,67 the Supreme Court has considered a very serious problem existing at present: in a medico-legal case (such as an accident) the doctors usually refuse to give immediate medical aid to the victim till legal formalities are completed. In some cases, the injured die for want of medical aid pending the completion of legal formalities. The Supreme Court has now very specifically clarified that preservation of life is of paramount importance. Once life is lost, status quo ante cannot be restored. It is the duty of the doctors to preserve life whether the concerned person be a criminal or an innocent person. Art. 21 casts on the State an obligation to preserve life. The Court has made the following pithy observation in this connection: \"A doctor at the Government hospital positioned to meet this State obligation is, therefore, duty bound to extend medical assistance for preserving life. Every doctor whether at a Government hospital or otherwise has the professional obligation to extend his services with due expertise for protecting life. No law or State action can intervene to avoid/delay the discharge of the paramount obligation cast upon members of the medical profession. The obligation being total, absolute and paramount, laws of procedure whether in statutes or otherwise which would interfere with the discharge of this obligation cannot be sustained and must, therefore give way ...\"68 The Court has also observed: \" Art. 21 of the Constitution casts an obligation on the State to preserve life. The patient whether he be an innocent or be a criminal liable to punishment under the laws of the society, it is the responsibility of those who are incharge of the health of the community to preserve life so that the innocent may be protected and the guilty may be punished. Social laws do not contemplate death by negligence to be tantamount to be legal punishment. Every doctor whether at a government hospital or otherwise has the professional obligation to extend his services with due expertise for protecting life.\" The matter has been taken one step forward in Paschim Banga Khet Mazdoor Samity v. State of West Bengal .69 A mazdoor fell from a running train and was seriously injured. He was sent from one government hospital to another and finally he had to be admitted in a private hospital where he had to incur an expenditure of Rs. 17,000/- on his treatment. Feeling aggrieved at the callous attitude shown by the various government hospitals, he filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court under Art. 32. The Court has ruled that the Constitution envisages establishment of a welfare state, and in a welfare state, the primary duty of the government is to provide adequate medical facilities for the people. The Government discharges this obligation by running hospitals and health centres to provide medical care to those who need them. \" Art. 21 imposes an obligation on the State to safeguard the right to life of every person.",

    "content": "Government discharges this obligation by running hospitals and health centres to provide medical care to those who need them. \" Art. 21 imposes an obligation on the State to safeguard the right to life of every person. Preservation of human life is thus of paramount importance.\"70 The Court has insisted that government hospitals and the medical officers employed therein are duty bound to extend medical assistance for preserving human life. Failure by a government hospital to provide timely medical treatment to a needy person violates his right to life guaranteed by Art. 21. In the instant case, petitioner's right under Art. 21 has been violated when he was denied treatment when he was in a critical state and needed immediate medical attention. Since his right under Art. 21 was denied by government servants, the State is liable to pay him compensation for breach of his right guaranteed under Art. 21. The Court awarded him a sum of Rs. 25000/- as compensation. Moreover, the Court issued several directions for avoidance of any such incident in future and to ensure immediate medical attention and treatment to persons in real need. The Court has laid stress on one very crucial point, viz., the State cannot plead lack of financial resources to carry out these directions meant to provide adequate medical services to the people. The State cannot avoid its constitutional obligation to provide adequate medical aid to the people on account of financial constraints.71 Page 1282 The Court has also said that other States, though not parties to the present case, should also take necessary steps to implement the directions given here. The Court also expected that the Government of India would render necessary assistance in the improvement of medical services in the country. But, in State of Punjab v. Ram Lubhaya Bagga,72 the Supreme Court has recognised that provision of health facilities cannot be unlimited. \"It has to be to the extent finance permit\". No country has unlimited resources to spend on any of its projects.73 And, right to get free and full medical aid or facilities has been held to be not a Fundamental Right of an ex-servicemen. The policy decision in formulating contributory scheme for ex-servicemen and asking them to pay 'one-time contribution', does not violate Article 21 nor as it inconsistent with Part IV of the Constitution.74 In Common Cause v. Union of India,75 the Apex Court highlighted the serious deficiencies and shortcomings in the matter of collection, storage and supply of blood through the various blood centres operating in the country, especially in the context of incidence of HIV infected cases.76The Court directed the government to establish a National Council of Blood Transfusion as a registered society. The Court also directed the States to establish similar bodies. The Court suggested that the blood banks ought to be licensed under the Drugs Control Act. (f) HEALTH OF LABOUR Occupational accidents and diseases remain the most appalling human tragedy of modern industry. Health hazards faced by the workers in the Asbestos factories were brought to the attention of the Supreme Court in CERC v. Union of India .77 After taking note of the cases78 in which it has been held that the right to life in Art. 21 includes \"right to human dignity\", the Court now held that \"right to health, medical aid to protect the health and vigour of a worker while in service or post-retirement is a Fundamental Right under Article 21, read with the Directive Principles in Articles 39(1), 41, 43, 48A and all related Articles and fundamental human rights to make the life of the workmen meaningful and purposeful with dignity of person.79 The Court has ruled further that in an appropriate case, the Court would give appropriate directions to the employer, be it the State or its undertaking or private employer to make the right to life meaningful, to prevent pollution of work place, protection of the environment, protection of the health of the workman or to preserve free and unpolluted water for the safety and health of the people. The authorities or even private persons or industry are bound by the directions issued by the Supreme Court under Art. 32 and Art. 142 of the Constitution.80 (g) CARE HOMES In Vikram Deo,81 the Supreme Court has taken note of the pitiable conditions prevailing in care homes maintained by the State of Bihar for women and children and has directed the State to improve matters in these homes and provide at least the minimum living conditions ensuring human dignity. The Court has emphasized that India is a welfare state and the Indian Constitution lays special emphasis on the protection and well being of the weaker sections of the society including women and children. Art. 21 envisages a quality of life consistent with his human personality. \"The right to live with human dignity is the Fundamental Right of every Indian citizen.\"82 Again, in Upendra Baxi v. State of Uttar Pradesh,1 the Supreme Court gave directions to the State Government seeking improvement of the living conditions in the government protective home at Agra. (h) RIGHT TO SHELTER In Shantisar Builders v. Narayan Khimlal Totame,2 the Supreme Court has ruled that the right to life is guaranteed in any civilized society. That would take within its sweep the right to food, the right to clothing, the right to decent environment and a reasonable accommodation to live in. The difference between the need of an animal and a human being for shelter has to be kept in view. For an animal it is the bare protection of the body; for a human being it has to be a suitable accommodation which would allow him to grow in every aspect--physical, mental and intellectual. Page 1283 The Urban Land Ceiling Act in Ss. 20 and 21 exempts urban land subject to the condition of constructing houses for weaker sections by builders. The Supreme Court has recognised the right to shelter as an inbuilt right to life under S.",

    "content": "an animal it is the bare protection of the body; for a human being it has to be a suitable accommodation which would allow him to grow in every aspect--physical, mental and intellectual. Page 1283 The Urban Land Ceiling Act in Ss. 20 and 21 exempts urban land subject to the condition of constructing houses for weaker sections by builders. The Supreme Court has recognised the right to shelter as an inbuilt right to life under S. 21 and has upheld the validity of exemption and gave directions to effectively implement the scheme. In several other cases3, the Court has read the right to shelter in Art. 19(1)(d) and Art. 21 to guarantee right to residence and settlement. Protection of life guaranteed by Art. 21 encompasses within its ambit the right to shelter to enjoy the meaningful right to life. The right to residence and settlement is regarded as a Fundamental Right under Art. 19(1)(e) and it is a facet of inseparable meaningful right to life under Art. 21. Food, shelter and clothing are minimal human rights. Again, in Chameli Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh,4 the Supreme Court has emphasized upon the right to shelter and has expounded its own concept of a shelter. The Court has observed: \"Shelter for a human being, therefore, is not a mere protection of his life and limb. It is home where he has opportunities to grow physically, mentally, intellectually and spiritually. Right to shelter, therefore, includes adequate living space, safe and decent structure, clean and decent surroundings, sufficient light, pure air and water, electricity, sanitation and other civic amenities like roads, etc. so as to have easy access to his daily avocation. The right to shelter, therefore, does not mean a mere right to a roof over one's head but right to all the infrastructure necessary to enable them to live and develop as a human being. Right to shelter when used as an essential requisite to the right to live, should be deemed to have been guaranteed as a Fundamental Right...\"5 The Court has again stated in the following case.6 \"Right to shelter is a Fundamental Right, which springs from the right to residence assured in Art. 19(1)(e) and right to life under Art. 21 of the Constitution\". (i) HILL ROADS Some poor Harijan residents of a few villages in the Simla district complained to the High Court that a hill road connecting their villages had been left incomplete by the State for a long time. This administrative inaction had totally deprived them of the road facility adversely affecting not only their livelihood but also their development. The High Court directed the State to complete the road. The State appealed to the Supreme Court against the High Court decision. In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Umed Ram,7 the Supreme Court emphasized upon the importance of roads in the hilly areas for the enjoyment of life. The entire Himachal Pradesh is in hills, and without workable roads, no communication is possible. The access of people in such an area to life outside is obstructed by the absence of roads. Reading Art. 21 with Art. 19(1)(d) in the background of the directive principle contained in Art. 38(2) every person has right under Art. 19(1)(d) to move freely throughout the territory of India. He has under Art. 21 right to life which right \"embraces not only physical existence of life but the quality of life and for residents of hilly areas access to road is access to life itself\". The Court has observed:8 \"We accept the proposition that there should be road for communication in reasonable conditions in view of our constitutional imperatives and denial of that right would be denial of the life as understood in its richness and fullness by the ambit of the Constitution. To the residents of the hilly areas as far as feasible and possible society has constitutional obligation to provide roads for communication\". (j-k) SEXUAL HARASSMENT The Supreme Court has made a novel use of Art. 21 viz., to ensure that the female workers are not sexually harassed by their male co-workers at their places of work. In Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan,9 the Supreme Court has declared sexual harassment of a working woman at her place of work as amounting to violation of rights of gender equality and right to life and liberty which is a clear violation of Arts. 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution. Page 1284 Article 21 guarantees right to life with dignity. Accordingly, the Court has observed in this connection:10 \"The meaning and content of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed in the Constitution of India are of sufficient amplitude to encompass all the facets of gender equality including prevention of sexual harassment or abuse.\" Sexual harassment also violates the victim's Fundamental Right under Art. 19(1)(g) \"to practice any profession or to carry out any occupation, trade or business\".11 Thus, Art. 32 is attracted.12 Further, the Court has accepted the proposition that the international conventions and norms are to be read into the Fundamental Rights when there is no inconsistency between them, and there is a void in the domestic law. According to the Court: \"It is now an accepted rule of judicial construction that regard must be had to international conventions and norms for construing domestic law when there is no inconsistency between them and there is a void in the domestic law.\"13 In the absence of any domestic law relating to sexual harassment in India, the Supreme Court has itself laid down under Art.",

    "content": "some directions for prevention of such harassment.14 These directions are binding and enforceable and are required to be strictly observed in all work places until suitable legislation is enacted to occupy the field.15 The Visakha ruling has been reiterated by the Supreme Court in Chopra16 where the Court has observed:17 \"There is no gainsaying that each incident of sexual harassment, at the place of work, results in violation of the Fundamental Right to gender equality and the Right to life and liberty--the two most precious Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India.... In our opinion, the contents of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed in our constitution are of sufficient amplitude to encompass all facets of gender equality, including prevention of sexual harassment and abuse and the Courts are under a constitutional obligation to protect and preserve those Fundamental Rights. That sexual harassment of a female at the place of work is incompatible with the dignity and honour of a female and needs to be eliminated....\" The directions issued by the Court place certain obligations on the employers or other responsible persons in work places and other institutions \"whether in the public or private sector.\" These persons are required to take appropriate steps to prevent\", sexual harassment. This means that in the area of sexual harassment, the Court has used Arts. 14, 15, 19(1)(g), 21 and 32 of the Constitution not only against the government and its instrumentalities but even against private parties and private employers. This portends that, in course of time, the coverage of certain Fundamental Rights may be expanded by the Supreme Court so as to bring within their scope even private parties and non-government organisations. (l) RAPE Rape has been held to be a violation of a person's Fundamental Right guaranteed under Art. 21. \"Right to Life\" means \"the Right to live with human dignity\". \"Right to 'life' would, therefore, include all those aspects of life which go to make a life meaningful, complete and worth living.\" Rape is a crime against basic human rights and is also violative of the victim's most cherished of the Fundamental Rights, namely, the Right to life contained in Art. 21. The Supreme Court has ruled that it has power to award interim compensation to the victim of rape before the final conviction of the offender. The Court has observed in this connection:18 \"Rape is a crime not only against the person of a woman, it is a crime against the entire society. It destroys the entire psychology of a woman and pushes her into deep emotional crisis. Rape is therefore the most hated crime. It is a crime against human rights and is violative of the victim's most cherished right, namely, right to life which includes right to live with human dignity contained in Art. 21.\" Again, it will be seen that the Court has used Art. 21 against private parties. (m) RIGHT TO PRIVACY Page 1285 The Constitution does not grant in specific and express terms any right to privacy as such. Right to privacy is not enumerated as a Fundamental Right in the Constitution. However, such a right has been culled by the Supreme Court from Art. 21 and several other provisions of the Constitution read with the Directive Principles of State Policy.19 For the first time, as early as 1963, in Kharak Singh,20 a question was raised whether the right to privacy could be implied from the existing Fundamental Rights, such as, Arts. 19(1)(d), 19(1)(e) and 21. The majority of the Judges participating in the decision said of the right to privacy that \"Our Constitution does not in terms confer any like constitutional guarantee.\"21 On the other hand, the minority opinion (Subba Rao, J.) was in favour of inferring the right to privacy from the expression 'personal liberty' in Art. 21. In the words of Subba Rao, J.:22 \"Further, the right to personal liberty takes in not only a right to be free from restrictions placed on his movements, but also free from encroachments on his private life. It is true our constitution does not expressly declare a right to privacy as a Fundamental Right, but the said right is an essential ingredient of personal liberty. Every democratic country sanctifies domestic life.......\" However, as already stated, police surveillance of a person by domiciliary visits was held void.23 In Govind v. State of Madhya Pradesh,24 the Supreme Court undertook a more elaborate appraisal of the right to privacy. In Govind, the Court considered the constitutional validity of a regulation which provided for surveillance by way of several measures indicated in the said regulation. The Court upheld the regulation by ruling that Art. 21 was not violated as the regulation in question was \"procedure established by law\", in terms of Art. 21. The Court also accepted a limited Fundamental Right to privacy \"as an emanation\" from Arts. 19(a), (d) and 21. The right to privacy is not, however, absolute; reasonable restrictions can be placed thereon in public interest under Art. 19(5). Thus, Mathew, J., observed in Govind:25 \"The right to privacy in any event will necessarily have to go through a process of case-by-case development. Therefore, even assuming that the right to personal liberty, the right to move freely throughout the territory of India and the freedom of speech create an independent right of privacy as an emanation from them which one can characterise as a Fundamental Right, we do not think that the right is absolute.\" Further, Mathew, J., observed on the same point:26 \"Assuming that the Fundamental Rights explicitly guaranteed to a citizen have penumbral zones and that the right of privacy is itself a Fundamental Right, that Fundamental Right must be subject to restriction on the basis of compelling public interest.\" Again, in R. Rajagopal v. State of Tamil Nadu,27 the Supreme Court has asserted that in recent times the right to privacy has acquired constitutional status; it is \"implicit in the right to life and liberty guaranteed to the citizens\" by Art. 21.",

    "content": "v. State of Tamil Nadu,27 the Supreme Court has asserted that in recent times the right to privacy has acquired constitutional status; it is \"implicit in the right to life and liberty guaranteed to the citizens\" by Art. 21. It is a \"right to be let alone.\" A citizen has a right \"to safeguard the privacy of his own, his family, marriage, procreation, motherhood, child bearing and education among other matters.\"28 The right to privacy has several aspects. One such aspect is the right to procreate. This is also known as \"the right of reproductive autonomy\". The right to use condoms, the right of a woman to abort, all these fall within the ambit of the right to privacy.29 The A.P. High Court has observed in B.K. Parthasarathi v. State of Andhra Pradesh :30 \"The right to make a decision about reproduction is essentially a very personal decision either on the part of the man or woman. Necessarily, such a right includes the right not to reproduce. The intrusion of the state into such a decision making process of the individual is scrutinised by the constitutional Courts both in this country and in America with great care\". After taking note of the above-mentioned cases, the Supreme Court has observed in People's Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of India :31 Page 1286 \"We have, therefore, no hesitation in holding that right to privacy is a part of the right to \"life\" and \"personal liberty\" enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution. Once the facts in a given case constitute a right to privacy, Article 21 is attracted. The said right cannot be curtailed 'except according to procedure established by law.' \" In State of Maharashtra v. Madhukar Narayan Mardikar,32 the Supreme Court protected the right to privacy of a prostitute. The Court held that even a woman of easy virtue is entitled to her privacy and no one can invade her privacy as and when he likes. The right to privacy has now become established in India, but as a part of Art. 21, and not as an independent right in itself, as such a right, by itself, has not been identified under the Constitution. The Court has however refused to define privacy saying, \"As a concept it may be too broad and moralistic to define it judicially. Whether right to privacy can be claimed or has been infringed in a given case would depend on the facts of the said case\". This means that whether the right to privacy can be claimed or has been infringed in a given situation would depend on the facts of the said case, and the view the Court takes of the matter. In R. Rajagopal v. State of Tamil Nadu,33 the Supreme Court has laid down certain propositions defining the right to privacy. The Court has sought to reconcile two Fundamental Rights, viz., right to privacy and the freedom of speech which may at times come in conflict.34 These propositions are: \"(1) the right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty guaranteed to the citizens of this country by Article 21. It is a \"right to be let alone\". A citizen has a right to safeguard the privacy of his own, his family, marriage, procreation, motherhood, child bearing and education among other matters. None can publish anything concerning the above matters without his consent--whether truthful or otherwise and whether laudatory or critical. If he does so, he would be violating the right to privacy of the person concerned and would be liable in an action for damages. Position may, however, be different, if a person voluntarily thrusts himself into controversy or voluntarily invites or raises a controversy. (2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception, that any publication concerning the aforesaid aspects becomes unobjectionable if such publication is based upon public records including Court records. This is for the reason that once a matter becomes a matter of public record, the right to privacy no longer subsists and it becomes a legitimate subject for comment by press and media among others. We are, however, of the opinion that in the interests of decency (Article 19(2))35 an exception must be carved out to this rule, viz., a female who is the victim of a sexual assault, kidnap, abduction or a like offence should not further be subjected to the indignity of her name and the incident being published in press/media. (3) There is yet another exception to the Rule in (1) above--indeed, this is not an exception but an independent rule. In the case of public officials, it is obvious, right to privacy, or for that matter, the remedy of action for damages is simply not available with respect to their acts and conduct relevant to the discharge of their official duties. This is so even where the publication is based upon facts and statements which are not true, unless the official establishes that the publication was made (by the defendant) with reckless disregard for truth. In such a case, it would be enough for the defendant (member of the press or media) to prove that he acted after a reasonable verification of the facts; it is not necessary for him to prove that what he has written is true. Of course, where the publication is proved to be false and actuated by malice or personal animosity, the defendant would have no defence and would be liable for damages. It is equally obvious that in matters not relevant to the discharge of his duties, the public official enjoys the same protection as any other citizen, as explained in (1) and (2) above.",

    "content": "need no reiteration that judiciary, which is protected by the power to punish for contempt of Court and the Parliament and Legislatures protected as their privileges are by Articles 105 and 194 respectively of the Constitution of India, represent exceptions to this rule.36 (4) So far as the Government, local authority and other organs and institutions exercising Governmental power are concerned, they cannot maintain a suit for damages for defaming them. (5) Rules 3 and 4 do not, however, mean that Official Secrets Act, 1923, or any similar enactment or provision having the force of law does not bind the press or media. (6) There is no law empowering the State or its officials to prohibit, or to impose a prior restraint upon the press/media.\" The Court has made it clear that the principles above mentioned are only the broad principles. They are neither exhaustive nor all-comprehending; indeed no such enunciation is possible or advisable. As rightly pointed out by Mathew, J., this right has to go through a case-by-case development. The concepts dealt with here are still in the process of evolution. Applying the above propositions, the Supreme Court permitted the newspaper to publish the biography of a Page 1287 confirmed criminal \"so far as it appears from the public records, even without his consent or authorisation\". If the press goes beyond this, it would be invading his privacy. The state or its officials cannot restrain the said publication. Their remedy, if any, would arise only after the publication.37 Surveillance per se may not violate individual or private rights including the right to privacy. Right to privacy is not enumerated as a Fundamental Right either in terms of Article 21 of the Constitution of India or otherwise. It, however, by reason of an elaborate interpretation by this Court in Kharak Singh v. State of U.P.,38 was held to be an essential ingredient of \"personal liberty\".39 (n) TAPPING OF TELEPHONE Emanating from the right to privacy of an individual is the question of tapping of telephone. Telephone tapping constitutes a serious invasion of an individual's right of privacy. Is it constitutionally permissible in India? If so, within what limits and subject to what safeguards? The Supreme Court has been called upon to consider these important constitutional questions. In R.M. Malkani v. State of Maharashtra,40 the Supreme Court stated that the telephonic conversation of an innocent person would be protected by the Courts against wrongful or high-handed interference by tapping of the conversation by the police. But the protection is not for the guilty against the efforts of the police to vindicate the law. This case falls in the pre-Maneka era. The questions posed above have been more fully considered by the Supreme Court in People's Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of India :41 The Court has ruled in the instant case that the right to privacy \"is a part of the right to 'life' and 'personal liberty' enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution\". Once the facts in a given case constitute a right to privacy, Art. 21 is attracted and the said right could not be curtailed \"except according to procedure established by law.\" Whether the right to privacy can be claimed or has been infringed in a given case would depend on the facts of the said case. The Court has ruled further that \"telephone conversation is an important facet of a man's private life.\" The right to hold a telephone conversation in the privacy of one's home or office without interference can certainly be claimed as \"right to privacy\". Conversations on the telephone are often of an intimate and confidential character. Telephone conversation is a part of modern man's life. Tapping of telephones is a serious invasion of privacy. \"Right to privacy would certainly include telephone-conversation in the privacy of one's home or office.\" This means that telephone tapping would infract Article 21 unless it is permitted under the procedure established by law. The procedure has to be \"just, fair and reasonable\". Further, talking on a telephone amounts to exercise by the individual of his right to freedom of speech and expression protected by Article 19(1)(a). This freedom means the right to express one's views, convictions and opinions freely by word of mouth, writing, printing, picture, or in any other manner. When a person is talking on telephone, he is exercising his right to freedom of speech and expression. This means that telephone tapping unless it comes within the compass of permissible restrictions under Art. 19(2) would infract Art. 19(1)(a).42 Telephone tapping is permissible in India under S. 5(2) of the Telegraph Act, 1885. The Court has held that this section is constitutionally valid. This section lays down the circumstances and the grounds when an order for tapping of a telephone may be passed. The constitutional validity of this provision has not been questioned, but no procedure for making the order is laid down therein.43 On an analysis of s. 5(2), the Court has concluded that the first step is the occurrence of any public emergency or the existence of any public safety interest. Thereafter, the competent authority under S. 5(2) is empowered to pass an order of interception after recording its satisfaction that it is necessary or expedient to do so in the interest of-- (i) sovereignty and integrity of India; (ii) the security of the State; Page 1288 (iii) friendly relations with foreign States; (iv) public order, or (v) for preventing incitement to the commission of an offence. These are the grounds inter alia mentioned in Art. 19(2). When any of the five situations mentioned above to the satisfaction of the competent authority requires, then the said authority may pass the order for interception of messages by recording reasons in writing for doing so. Thus, so far as the power to intercept messages/conversations is concerned, S. 5(2) clearly lays down the situations/conditions under which it can be exercised. But the substantive law as laid down in S.",

    "content": "are the grounds inter alia mentioned in Art. 19(2). When any of the five situations mentioned above to the satisfaction of the competent authority requires, then the said authority may pass the order for interception of messages by recording reasons in writing for doing so. Thus, so far as the power to intercept messages/conversations is concerned, S. 5(2) clearly lays down the situations/conditions under which it can be exercised. But the substantive law as laid down in S. 5(2) must have procedural backing so that the exercise of power is fair and reasonable. The said procedure itself must be fair, just and reasonable. \"A valuable constitutional right can be canalized only by civilized processes\". In the absence of just and fair procedure for regulating the exercise of power under section 5(2) of the Act, it is not possible to safeguard the rights of the citizens guaranteed under Arts. 19(1)(a) and 21 of the Constitution of India. Accordingly, the Court has itself filled in the gap by issuing procedural directions for exercise of the power under S. 5(2) of the Telegraph Act, 1885. The Court has laid down inter alia that an order of telephone-tapping under S. 5(2) shall not be made except by the Home Secretary, Government of India and the Home Secretaries of the State Governments. In an urgent case, the power may be delegated to an officer of the Home Department, Govt. of India and the State Govt. not below the rank of Joint Secretary. A review committee consisting of the Cabinet Secretary, Law Secretary and the Secretary, Telecommunications at the Central level to ensure that there is no contravention of S. 5(2). A similar committee is to be set up at the State level. The Court has also advised the Central Government to frame rules under S. 7 of the Act. The rule-making power has been in existence for over a century but has never been exercised by the Central government. Thus, the power of telephone tapping has now become a regulated power both procedurally and substantively. The directions issued by the Court are designed to exclude arbitrariness and to safeguard the right to privacy of an individual. The directions issued by the Court would remain in force till the Central Government itself lays down \"just, fair and reasonable\" procedure by making rules under S. 7(2)(b) of the Act for this purpose. In the course of its judgment, the Supreme Court referred to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966, to which India is a signatory. Art. 17 of the Covenant provides for right of privacy and this provision does not go counter to Art. 21 of the Indian Constitution. Art. 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948, is almost in similar terms. The Court has accordingly interpreted Art. 21 in conformity with the International Law.44 (o) RIGHT TO REPUTATION Right to reputation is a facet of the right to life of a citizen under Art. 21.45 It takes within its sweep right to reputation,46 right to breathe unpolluted air,47 personal liberty;48 right to livelihood49; right to privacy.50 It has been reiterated that since right to reputation is a person's valuable asset and is a facet of his right under Article 21 that the court has inherent power to grant interim bail pending the disposal of the regular bail.51 (p) ECOLOGY/ENVIRONMENT Apart from several personal rights which the Supreme Court has spelt out of Art. 21, as stated above, the Supreme Court has made a signal contribution to the welfare of the people by using Art. 21 for the improvement of the environment. The Supreme Courthas pointed out that two salutary principles governing environment are (i) principle of sustainable development, and (ii) precautionary principle. It was held that Convention on Biological Diversity having been acceded to by India, the Government should, in the absence of compelling reasons, keep in Page 1289 view the international obligations while exercising its discretionary powers under Forest (Conservation) Act.52 The expansive interpretation of 'life' in Art. 21 has led to the salutary development of an environmental jurisprudence in India. Although a number of statutes have been enacted with a view to protect environment against pollution, and an administrative machinery has been put in place for the purpose of enforcement of these statutes, the unfortunate fact remains that the Administration has done nothing concrete towards reducing environmental pollution. Government is not powerless to ensure compliance with environmental law but because environment authorities were not executing their authority, the Supreme Court directed them to issue requisite order for closure of defaulting units continuing to operate in violation of environmental laws.53 In this context, the Supreme Court has performed a yeoman service by taking cognizance, in a number of cases, of various environmental problems and giving necessary directions to the Administration. The Court has thus compelled an inactive and inert Administration to make some movement towards reducing environmental pollution. In this way, the Court has promoted a broad social interest. For this purpose, the Court has depended upon such Directive Principles as those contained in Arts. 47 and 48A as well as on the Fundamental Duty contained in Art. 51A(g) of the Constitution.54 The right to healthy environment is an internationally recognized essential. For example, the Basel Convention effectuates the Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Art. 21, the right to information and community participation for protection of environment and human health.55 The callous attitude of the State and other authorities in relation to education and environment and the ambience of an unique institution, i.e. Visva Bharati University, Santiniketan established by Rabindra Nath Tagore was threatened by promoters interested in construction of residential and commercial complexes in the territorial area comprising Santiniketan.",

    "content": "Supreme Court intervened and directed that the constructional activities must be in consonance with the provisions of the West Bengal Town and Country (Planning and Development) Act and Rules and Regulations framed thereunder as also other relevant Acts, report and directions of W.B. Pollution Control Board and object, purpose, ideals and tradition for which Visva Bharati was established under the Visva Bharati Act. The Court emphasized that Visva Bharati is an institution of national importance, having its unique features and it is the duty of the State and the Development Authority not to allow activities within the territorial limits which may damage environmental ambience of the area contrary to the ideals of Visva Bharati.56 On the question of relationship between ecology and Art. 21, the thinking of the Court is that since the right to life is a Fundamental Right under Art. 21, and since the right to life connotes \"quality of life\", a person has a right to the enjoyment of pollution free water and air to enjoy life fully. Any disturbance of the basic environment elements, namely, air, water and soil, which are necessary for 'life' would be hazardous to 'life' within the meaning of Art. 21 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has accepted the doctrine of public trust which rests on the premise that certain natural resources like air, sea, waters are means for general use and cannot be restricted to private ownership. These resources are a gift of nature and the State, as a trustee thereof, is duty bound to protect them. The State is the trustee, and general public the beneficiary, of such natural resources as sea, running waters, air, forests, ecologically fragile lands'.57 In one such case the Supreme Court directed that heavy, medium or light-goods vehicles not conforming to Euro II norms or not using low sulphur or low benzene fuel and plying on inter State routes were not to be allowed to pass through Delhi.58 Hygienic environment is an integral facet of healthy life. Right to live with human dignity becomes illusory in the absence of humane and healthy environment.59 Therefore, if anything endangers or impairs that quality of life in derogation of laws, a person can take recourse to Art. 32 or Art. 226 for removal of pollution of water or air which may be detrimental to the quality of life. A petition for prevention of pollution is maintainable at the instance of the affected person or persons, Page 1290 or even by a group of social workers or journalists.60 Numerous cases complaining of environmental pollution have come before the Courts by way of public interest litigation which is filed under Arts. 32 or 226.61 The environmental issues in relation to an upcoming project and its interrelation with acquisition of land for the purpose of such project has been considered by the Supreme Court in Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board.62 In this case the Agriculturists who were affected by the acquisition of land in different villages approached the High Court of Karnataka for a direction on the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board to refrain from converting the lands of the respondents for any industrial or other purposes which was being used by them for grazing their cattle and that it would also have an adverse impact on the environment of the villages. One of the arguments advanced was that the deprivation of their land was violative of their Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. The Court referred to several international conventions and conferences to bring out the true scope of the concept of sustainable development. The Court also referred to many of its earlier judgments and in particular to M. C. Mehta,63 and the public trust doctrine based on the principle that certain resources like air, sea, water and forests are of such importance to the people as a whole that it would be wholly unjustified to make them a subject of private ownership.64 The Court expressed, the view that a delicate balance between industrialisation and ecology has to be maintained, and while development of industry is essential for the growth of the economy, at the same time the environment and ecosystem were also required to be protected. Ultimately the Court gave two significant directions namely : (1) We direct that, in future, before acquisition of lands for development, the consequence and adverse impact of development on environment must be properly comprehended and the lands be acquired for development that they do not gravely impair the ecology and environment; (2) We also direct the appellant to incorporate in the condition of allotment to obtain clearance from the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board before the land is allotted for development. The said directory condition of allotment of lands be converted into a mandatory condition for all the projects to be sanctioned in future. For the purpose of maintaining ecological balance the Court has laid down that the principle of sustainable development comes within the concept of \"balancing\" whereas mining beyond the principle of sustainable development comes within the concept of 'banning'.65 The word 'environment' has a broad spectrum and within its ambit fall \"hygienic atmosphere and ecological balance.\" The State is thus obligated to maintain hygienic environment and ecological balance. Art. 21 protects right to life as a Fundamental Right, and it encompasses within its ambit enjoyment of life and right to life with human dignity, protection and preservation of environment, ecological balance free from pollution of air and water, without which life cannot be enjoyed. Environmental, ecological, air, water pollution etc. amount to violation of Art. 21. Hygienic environment is thus an integral fact of the right to healthy life as it is not possible to live with human dignity without a humane and healthy environment. There is, therefore, a constitutional imperative on the government not only to ensure and safeguard proper environment but also to take adequate measures to promote, protect and improve both the man-made and the natural environment.",

There is, therefore, a constitutional imperative on the government not only to ensure and safeguard proper environment but also to take adequate measures to promote, protect and improve both the man-made and the natural environment. The Supreme Court has reiterated the public trust doctrine in relation to conservation of forests, i.e. the Government held them in trusteeship for the free and unimpeded use of the general public. The Supreme Court has emphasized that environment is not the property of any state but is a national asset and that it is the obligation of all to conserve the same and its proper utilisation must have regard to the principles of sustainable development and intergenerational equity.66 In Subhash Kumar v. Bihar,67 the Apex Court has held that enjoyment of pollution free environment is included in the right to life under Art. 21. The Court has observed: \"Right to live is a Fundamental Right under Art. 21 of the Constitution and it includes the right of enjoyment of pollution free water and air for full enjoyment of life. If anything endangers or impairs that quality of life in derogation of laws, a citizen has right to have recourse to Art. 32 of the Constitution for removing the pollution of water or air which may be detrimental to the quality of life\". Page 1291 In A.P. Pollution Control Board v. M.V. Nayudu,68 the Supreme Court has made very valuable suggestions for improvement of the adjudicatory machinery under the various environmental laws. The main burden of these suggestions is that in all environmental Courts, tribunals and appellate authorities, there should be a judge of the rank of a High Court or a Supreme Court Judge, sitting or retired, and a scientist or a group of scientists of high ranking and experience so as to help a proper and fair adjudication of disputes relating to environment and pollution. Further, a provision ought to be made for an appeal to the Supreme Court. The present day system of adjudication is not satisfactory. The scientific and technological issues arising in environmental matters are extremely complex and, therefore, there is need for technical persons well versed in environmental laws to handle these issues. The following are some of the well-known cases on environment under Art. 21. In M.C. Mehta v. Union of India,69 the Supreme Court ordered closure of tanneries which were polluting water. In M.C. Mehta v. Union of India,70 the Supreme Court issued several guidelines and directions for the protection of the Taj Mahal, an ancient monument, form environmental degradation. In Vellore Citizens Welfare Forum v. Union of India,71 the Court took cognizance of environmental problems being caused by tanneries which were polluting all water resources, rivers, canals, underground water and agricultural land. The Court issued several directions to deal with the problem. To protect the rapidly deteriorating quality of air so as to protect the health of the people in Delhi, which is a facet of Art. 21 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court has directed that the entire fleet of public transport buses be run on CNG and not diesel. The Court has put a ban on running of diesel buses in Delhi.72 The Supreme Court has laid down that the \"Precautionary Principle\" and the \"Polluter Pays Principle\" are essential features of \"sustainable development.\" These concepts are part of Environmental Law of the country. The concept of sustainable development is based on the principle of inter-generational equity. Development needs of the person without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs is the basis of this concept.73 The \"Precautionary Principle\" means that the State Government and the concerned statutory authorities must anticipate, prevent and attack causes of environmental degradation. The principle of \"polluter pays\" means that one who carries on a hazardous activity is liable to make good the loss caused to another person by such activity. The Court has ruled:74 \"Once the activity carried on is hazardous or inherently dangerous, the person carrying on such activity is liable to make good the loss caused to any other person by his activity irrespective of the fact whether he took reasonable care while carrying on his activity. The rule is premised upon the very nature of the activity carried on.\" In M.C. Mehta v. Union of India,75 the Court has observed: \"The 'polluter pays' principle as interpreted by this Court means that the absolute liability for harm to the environment extends not only to compensate the victims of pollution but also the cost of restoring the environmental degradation.\"76 This means that the polluting industries are \"absolutely liable to compensate for the harm caused by them to villagers in the affected area.\" \"Remediation of the damaged environment is part of the process of \"sustainable development\" and, as such, polluter is liable to pay the cost to the individual sufferers as well as the cost of reversing the damaged ecology.77 The Supreme Court has recently explained the implication of the \"Polluter-Pays\" Principle. Under Art. 32, the Supreme Court awards damages against those who disturb ecological balance by causing pollution in the Page 1292 environment. The \"Polluter Pays\" Principle is a means of paying for the cost of pollution. The polluter is under an obligation to make good the damage caused to the environment. Under the principle, the polluter may be directed to pay damages not only for restoration of ecological balance but also to pay damages to the victims who have suffered because of ecological disturbance. The Court may also award exemplary damages against the polluter so as to deter others from causing pollution. The Court has characterized pollution as a tort-a civil wrong against the society.78 The Court has also evolved the special burden of proof in environmental cases.",

    "content": "Court has characterized pollution as a tort-a civil wrong against the society.78 The Court has also evolved the special burden of proof in environmental cases. The Court has stated in Vellore:79 \"The 'onus of proof' is on the actor or the developer/industrialist to show that his action is environmentally benign.\" The Supreme Court has explained the inter-relation between ecological issues and Fundamental Rights as follows:80 \"Environmental concerns arising in this Court under Article 32 or under Article 136 or under Article 226 in the High Courts are, in our view, of equal importance as human Rights concerns. In fact both are to be traced to Article 21 which deals with Fundamental Rights to life and liberty. While environmental aspects concern 'life', human rights aspects concern 'liberty'. Right to live being a Fundamental Right under Art. 21, it includes the right of enjoyment of pollution free water and air for full enjoyment of life. If anything endangers or impairs that quality of life in derogation of laws, a citizen has a right to take recourse to Art. 32 or 226 of the Constitution81 for removal of pollution of water or air which may be detrimental to the quality of life.82 In certain situations exemption may be required by nature of peculiar circumstances of a case and the same to be decided as and when necessary on case to case basis.83 The Supreme Court has recognized that conservation and regeneration requires a policy and huge funds would be required to implement such policies. Such funds generated to protect ecology and provide for regeneration could not in the Constitutional scheme be considered and treated as a fund relatable to any specific provision of the Constitution.84 (q) NOISE POLLUTION The Supreme Court has recognized that noise constitutes a real and present danger to people's health and laid down certain tests for permissible limits. The Court observed that concept of noise pollution standards was relative and must relate and be dependent upon the person concerned and the place of occurrence. The law will not take care of a super sensitive person but the standard is of an average and rational human being in society. The Court issued detailed directions to the State to: (1) need for framing a single specific and detailed legislation to deal with issue of noise pollution; (2) creation of civic awareness of the hazardous effects of sound;(3) creation of effective mechanism and infrastructure for implementing laws relating to control of noise pollution; and (4) the taking of effective preventive measures to control noise pollution. The Court pointed out that noise had auditory and non-auditory effects depending upon the intensity and the duration of the noise level. It affects sleep, hearing, mental and physical health. It can disturb work, rest, sleep and communication. It can damage hearing and evoke other psychological, and possibly pathological reactions. The Court noted that noise is a type of atmospheric pollution. The Court took into account the fact that cases regarding noise have not come before the law Courts in large numbers and the reason behind this is that many people (in India) do not consider noise as a pollutant and they are not very conscious of the evil consequences of noise pollution. The Court defined noise as unwanted sound. Sound which pleases the listeners is music and that which causes pain and annoyance is noise. At times, what is music for some can be noise for others. The disturbance produced in our environment by undesirable sound of various kinds is called noise pollution. The Court pointed out that although there is no specific provision in the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to deal with noise pollution, theAct confers powers on Government of India to take measures to deal with various types of pollution Page 1293 including noise pollution, as noise was included in the definition of air pollutant in Section 2(a) of Air (Prevention and control of Pollution) Actin 1987. Other statutory provisions dealing with noise pollution include the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, Sections 268 , 290 and 291IPC Section 133Cr. P.C. 1973,Sections 89, 90r/w Sch. III Factories Act, 1948 and Rules 119 and 120 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989. The Court considered quietness and freedom from noise as indispensable to the full and free enjoyment of a dwelling house. No proprietor has an absolute right to create noises upon his own land, because any right which the law gives is qualified by the condition that it must not be exercised to the nuisance of his neighbours or of the public. Any noise which has the effect of materially interfering with the ordinary comforts of life, judged by the standard of a reasonable man is nuisance. How and when a nuisance created by noise becomes actionable has to be answered by reference to its degree and the surrounding circumstances, the place and the time. Noise will create an actionable nuisance only if it materially interferes with the ordinary comfort of life, judged by ordinary, plain and simple notions, and having regard to the locality; the question being one of degree and relatively. A much needed restraint had to be considered by theSupreme Court because of the inaction of the states. The Court recognized the danger of noise pollution and gave indispensable directions to the State Government. It ruled that no one shall beat a drum or tom-tom or blow a trumpet, bugle or the like or beat or sound any instrument or use any sound amplifier at night (between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.) except in public emergencies. The peripheral noise level of privately owned sound systems shall not exceed by more than 5 dB(A) the ambient air quality standard specified for the area in which they are used, at the boundary of the private place. No horn should be allowed to be used at night (between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.) in residential areas except in exceptional circumstances.",

    "content": "peripheral noise level of privately owned sound systems shall not exceed by more than 5 dB(A) the ambient air quality standard specified for the area in which they are used, at the boundary of the private place. No horn should be allowed to be used at night (between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.) in residential areas except in exceptional circumstances. The States shall make provision for seizure and confiscation of loudspeakers, amplifiers and such other equipment as are found to be creating noise beyond the permissible limits. These would remain in force until modified by the Supreme Court itself or superseded by appropriate legislation.85 Submissions to the effect that certain festivals were accompanied customarily by bursting firecrackers at night, or that the fireworks industry would be adversely affected if the restrictive directions were not suspended was on the reasoning that such rejected considerations cannot come in the way of enforcement of Fundamental Right to live in peace and comfort in an atmosphere free from pollution of any kind, such as that caused by noise.86 In Bombay Dyeing87 it has been said that sustainable development is a welcome feature but while emphasizing the need of ecological impact, a delicate balance between it and the necessity for development must be struck. Whereas it is not possible to ignore intergenerational interest, it is also not possible to ignore the dire need which the society urgently requires today. A PIL was filed for curbing noise pollution. The case arose out of a very tragic incident when the cries for help of a 13 year old girl who was being raped went unheard due to blaring noise of music over loud speaker. Later the girl set herself ablaze and died. The Supreme Court observed that noise polluters often take shelter behind Article 19(1)(a) pleading freedom of speech and right to expression. The Court held that nobody can claim Fundamental Right to create noise by amplifying the sound of his speech by using loud speaker. By amplifying ones speech with aid of artificial devices, a person cannot expose an unwilling listener to obnoxious levels of noise there by violating the other persons right to peaceful, pollution free life guaranteed under Art. 21. Art. 19(1)(a) cannot be pressed into service for defeating the Fundamental Right guaranteed under Article 21.88 (r) HIV POSITIVE PERSONS No law has yet been enacted in India defining the rights and duties of HIV infected persons. Therefore, the Courts are seeking to fill in the legal gap by their decisions. Within the last few years, several pronouncements have been made by the Supreme Court and the High Courts concerning such persons. In Mr. X v. Hospital Z,89 the Supreme Court was called upon to decide a very crucial question in the modern social context, viz: can a doctor disclose to the would be wife of a person that he is HIV positive? Does it infringe the right to privacy of the person concerned? The Court has answered both of these questions in the negative. The Court has argued that the lady proposing to marry such a person is also entitled to all the human rights which are available to any human being. Page 1294 The \"right to life\" guaranteed by Art. 21 \"would positively include the right to be told that a person with whom she was proposed to be married, was the victim of a deadly disease, which was sexually communicable\". Moreover, when two Fundamental Rights clash, viz., that of the person concerned (right to privacy) and that of the would be wife (to live a healthy life also guaranteed by Art. 21), \"the Right which would advance the public morality or public interest, would alone be enforced through the process of Court.\"90 The Court has observed defining the rights of such persons:91 \"The patients suffering from the dreadful disease AIDS deserve full sympathy. They are entitled to all respect as human beings. Their society cannot, and should not be avoided, which otherwise, would have bad psychological impact upon them. They have to have their avocation. Government jobs or service cannot be denied to them. But, 'sex' with them or possibility thereof has to be avoided as otherwise they would infect and communicate the dreadful disease to others. The Court cannot assist that person to achieve that object.\" The Bombay High Court has in MX of Bombay v. M/s. ZY,92 considered the important question whether the state can deny job opportunities to a HIV Positive person. In the instant case, a casual labourer was denied work because he tested HIV Positive. The Court has pointed out that because of Art. 21, no person can be deprived of his right to livelihood except according to procedure established by law. Such a procedure established by law has to be just, fair and reasonable. The High Court has ruled in the instant case that it is arbitrary to deny the job of a casual worker to a HIV positive person. According to medical opinion, such a person can discharge his normal duties and he poses no risk to any fellow worker. The Court has characterised denial of the job of a casual labourer as \"unjustified and illegal\". The Court has observed in this connection that the rule denying employment to the HIV infected person merely on the ground of his HIV status irrespective of his ability to perform the job requirements and irrespective of the fact that he does not pose any threat to others at the work place \"is clearly arbitrary and unreasonable and infringes the wholesome requirements of Art. 14 as well as Art. 21 of the Constitution of India.\" The Court has also ruled that the circular directing termination of service of the HIV positive persons is \"unconstitutional, illegal and invalid,\" and so the Court has quashed the circular.",

    "content": "as well as Art. 21 of the Constitution of India.\" The Court has also ruled that the circular directing termination of service of the HIV positive persons is \"unconstitutional, illegal and invalid,\" and so the Court has quashed the circular. In the instant case, the High Court also awarded damages to the applicant for the period for which he had remained out of job.1 A statutory provision authorising the government to isolate and keep persons found positive for AIDS in separate institutions and wards has been held valid. Such a provision does not violate Arts. 14 and 21. In such cases, individual rights have to be balanced in the public interest.2 The Court has observed : \"In fact liberty of an individual and public health are not opposed to each other but are in well accord. Even if there is a conflict between the right of an individual and public interest, the former must yield to the latter...\" (s) RIGHT TO DIE If Art. 21 confers on a person the right to live a dignified life, does it also confer a right not to live if the person chooses to end his life? If so, then what is the fate of the provisions in the Penal Code making attempt to commit suicide penal? In P. Rathinam v. Union of India,3 a two Judge Bench of the Supreme Court took cognisance of the relationship/contradiction between S. 309,I.P.C., and Art. 21. The Court ruled that the right to life embodied in Art. 21 also embodied in it a \"right not to live\" a forced life, to his detriment, disadvantage or disliking. This view constituted an authority for the proposition that an individual has the right to do as he pleases with his life and to end it if he so pleases. \"A person cannot be forced to enjoy right to life to his detriment, disadvantage or disliking.\" The Court argued that the word 'life' in Art. 21 means right to live with human dignity and \"the same does not merely connote continued drudgery. Thus, the Court concluded that the \"right Page 1295 to live of which Art. 21 speaks of can be said to bring in its trail the right not to live a forced life.\"4 The Bench even called for the deletion of S. 309,I.P.C., labelling it as cruel, irrational which results actually in punishing an individual twice.S. 309,I.P.C., according to the Court, violates Art. 21 and is therefore void. This is necessary to humanise the law. In the opinion of the Court, attempted suicides are a medical and social problem and are best dealt with by non-customary measures. The Court emphasized that attempt to commit suicide is in reality a cry for help and not for punishment.5 The above was a radical view and could not last for long. The Rathinam ruling came to be reviewed by a full bench of the Court in Gian Kaur v. State of Punjab6. The question arose that if attempt to commit suicide is not regarded as penal then what happens to someone who abets suicide. Abetment to commit suicide is made punishable in S. 306,I.P.C. But then, if the principal offence of attempting to commit suicide is void as being unconstitutional vis-a-vis Art. 21, then how could abetment thereof be punishable logically speaking. The factual setting in Gian Kaur was as follows: Gian Kaur and her husband were convicted under S. 306,I.P.C., for abetting the commission of suicide by Kulwant, their daughter-in-law. It was argued thatS. 306 was unconstitutional as S. 309,I.P.C., had already been declared unconstitutional in Rathinam. It was argued that the 'right to die' having been included in Art. 21 (Rathinam), andS. 309having been declared unconstitutional, any person abetting the commission of suicide by another is merely assisting in the enforcement of his Fundamental Right under Art. 21. That is sufficient to declare Art. 306, I.P.C., as unconstitutional being violative of Art. 21. This argument led to the reconsideration of the Rathinam ruling and its eventual overruling. The Court has ruled in Gian Kaur that Art. 21 is a provision guaranteeing protection of life and personal liberty and by no stretch of imagination can extinction of life be read to be included in \"protection of life.\" The Court has observed further:7 \"...... 'Right to life' is a natural right embodied in Art. 21 but suicide is an unnatural termination or extinction of life and, therefore, incompatible and inconsistent with the concept of \"right to life\". The Court thus has ruled that S. 309,I.P.C., is not unconstitutional. Accordingly,S. 306,I.P.C., has also been held to be constitutional. The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutional validity of S. 309,I.P.C., inLokendra Singh v. State of Mahdya Pradesh .8 This provision does not offend Art. 14 because there is inbuilt flexibility therein. It gives discretion to the Court to award suitable punishment commensurate with the gravity of offence against compulsion of giving disproportionately harsh punishment in all cases of offence of attempt to commit suicide. This flexibility protects S. 309 , IPC, from the vice of being unconscionably harsh. In an appropriate case, the Court can even impose fine. In Gian Kaur, the Supreme Court has distinguished between euthanasia and attempt to commit suicide. Euthanasia is termination of life of a person who is terminally ill, or in a persistent vegetative state. In such a case, death due to termination of natural life is certain and imminent. The process of natural death has commenced; it is only reducing the period of suffering during the process of natural death. This is not a case of extinguishing life but only of accelerating conclusion of the process of natural death which has already begun. This may fall within the concept of right to live with human dignity upto the end of natural life. This may include the right of a dying man to die with dignity when his life is ebbing out.",

This may fall within the concept of right to live with human dignity upto the end of natural life. This may include the right of a dying man to die with dignity when his life is ebbing out. But this cannot be equated with the right to die an unnatural death curtailing the natural span of life. (t) RIGHT TO HEALTH The Supreme Court has emphasized in Vincent v. Union of India9 that a healthy body is the very foundation of all human activities. Art. 47, a Directive Principle,10 lays stress on improvement of public health and prohibition of drugs injurious to health as one of the primary duties of the State. The Court has observed in Vincent. Page 1296 \"...maintenance and improvement of public health have to rank high as these are indispensable to the very physical existence of the community and on the betterment of these depends the building of the society of which the constitution makers envisaged. Attending to public health, in our opinion, therefore, is of high priority--perhaps the one at the top'.\" In the instant case, the petitioner had sought directions to ban import, manufacture sale of such drugs as were banned by the Drugs Consultative Committee. The Court emphasized that injurious drugs should be totally eliminated from the market and made several suggestions for achieving this object. Keeping in view the technical aspects, such a matter could not be handled effectively by the Court. It was a matter to be handled by the Central Government keeping in view the best interests of the citizens. (u) ECONOMIC RIGHTS By reading Art. 21 alongwith the Preamble to the Constitution11 and several Directive Principles,12 the Supreme Court has ruled that social justice, right to economic justice, right to economic equality, economic empowerment of the weaker sections of the society constitute Fundamental Rights. The aim of social justice is to attain substantial degree of social, economic and political equality. Social justice and equality are complementary to each other.13 The question of economic rights of the weaker sections of the society has been further discussed in the Chapter on Directive Principles. (v) COMMENTS The march of Art. 21 still continues. The frontiers of Art. 21 are still expanding and its new dimensions are still being explored by the Courts. It is quite possible that, in course of time, the Courts may possibly be able to imply some more rights for the people out of Art. 21 because the concept of a 'dignified life' guaranteed by Art. 21 seems to be inexhaustible in range and scope. It is left to the ingenuity of the Courts to explore this concept to the extent they can in the Indian social context. 1. See Chapter XXIV, supra. 2. Louis De Raedt v.

The Court drew support for this thesis from the social contract theories of Locke and Hobbes as well as from the theories prevailing in Ancient India as found in Mahabharta and Dharmasastra: Ibid. at 529. 17. The Indian statutes use three terms for describing break down of law and order. These are, in the ascending order of seriousness: 'law and order', 'public order' and 'security of state'. 'Law and order' comprehends disorders of less gravity than the term 'public order' which comprehends disorders of less gravity than those affecting 'security of state'. As explained by the High Court: \"One has to imagine three concentric circles. Law and order represents the largest circle within which is the next circle representing public order and the smallest circle represents security of state\". Ibid. 530. Also see in this connection, discussion under Preventive Detention where these concepts have been used: infra, Ch. XXVII, Secs. B and D. 18. The Court held Parliament competent to enact the law providing for the use of armed forces in aid of the civil power in a disturbed area. Such a law does not deal with 'public order'--a state subject, but only with the use of central forces: Ibid at 535. 19. Olga Tellis v.

Henry Wade, 410 US 113, the U.S. Supreme Court has observed regarding the right to privacy: \"Although the Constitution of the U.S.A. does not explicitly mention any right of privacy, the U.S. Supreme Court recognizes that a right of personal privacy, or a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy, does exist under the Constitution, and that the roots of that right may be found in the First Amendment, in the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, in the penumbras of the Bill of Rights, in the Ninth Amendment, and in the concept of liberty guaranteed by the first section of the XIV Amendment and that the \"right of privacy is not absolute.\" The Supreme Court in India has taken into consideration the U.S. position as well as Art. 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights which defines the Right to Privacy. 29. These matters have been very widely discussed in the U.S.A. In Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the right to have an abortion is a part of the fundamental constitutional right of privacy of the woman and the state can interfere with such a right only to promote some compelling interest of the State, e.g. the health of the woman seeking an abortion. The U.S. Supreme Court observed : \"The Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy. In a line of decisions, however...",

M P Jain Indian Constitutional Law/Volume 1/PART V POLITICAL AND CIVIL RIGHTS/CHAPTER XXVII Fundamental Rights (8) CHAPTER XXVII Fundamental Rights (8) A. PROTECTION AGAINST ARREST The protection of the individual from oppression and abuse by the police and other enforcement officers is a major interest in a free society. Arrest and detention in police lock-up may be very traumatic for a person. It can cause him incalculable harm by way of loss of his reputation. Denying a person of his liberty is a serious matter. The Supreme Court has clarified in Joginder Kumar v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 1 that no arrest can be made because it is lawful for the police officer to do so. The existence of the power of arrest is one thing, the justification for its exercise is quite another. 'The police officer must be able to justify the arrest apart from his power to do so'. Accordingly, the Court has laid down the following guidelines in this regard for the police to follow: \"No arrest can be made in a routine manner on a mere allegation of commission of an offence made against a person. It would be prudent for a police officer in the interest of protection of the constitutional rights of a citizen and perhaps in his own interest that no arrest should be made without a reasonable satisfaction reached after some investigation as to Page 1313 the genuineness and bona fide of a complaint and a reasonable belief both as to the person's complicity and even so as to the need to effect arrest.\" Art. 22 guarantees the minimum rights which any person who is arrested will enjoy. Clauses (1) and (2) of Art. 22 ensure the following four safeguards for a person who is arrested: (1) He is not to be detained in custody without being informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds of his arrest [ Art. 22(1)].",

    "content": "guarantees the minimum rights which any person who is arrested will enjoy. Clauses (1) and (2) of Art. 22 ensure the following four safeguards for a person who is arrested: (1) He is not to be detained in custody without being informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds of his arrest [ Art. 22(1)]. (2) He shall not be denied the right to consult, and to be defended by, a legal practitioner of his choice [ Art. 22(2)]. (3) A person arrested and detained in custody is to be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of twenty-four hours of his arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the magistrate's court [ Art. 22(2)]. (4) No such person is to be detained in custody beyond this period without the authority of a magistrate [ Art. 22(2)]. Each of the above-mentioned rules is explained below. It may also be noted that when a person is arrested, Art. 21 also is activated. On such matters on which Art. 22 is silent, recourse may be had to Art. 21.2 Art. 22 advances in a way the purpose of Art. 21 insofar as it specifies some guaranteed rights available to persons arrested or detained. (a) RULE 1: INFORMATION ABOUT GROUNDS OF ARREST Information about the grounds of arrest is mandatory under Art. 22(1).3 The Supreme Court has said about this rule in Shobharam:4 \"In other words, a person's personal liberty cannot be curtailed by arrest without informing him, as soon as is possible, why he is arrested\". The reason behind the rule requiring communication of grounds to the person arrested is to enable him to prepare his defence, and to move the court for bail, or for a writ of habeas corpus.5 Failure to inform the person arrested of the reasons for his arrest would entitle him to be released.6 If information is delayed, there must be some reasonable grounds justified by circumstances.7 For purposes of this rule, it is not necessary to furnish him with full details of the offence, but the information should be sufficient to enable him to understand why he has been arrested and to give him an idea of the offence which he is alleged to have committed. The grounds given to the arrested person should be intelligible.8 The court can go into the question of sufficiency of the information supplied to the arrested person and if it finds the information to be insufficient, the arrest becomes unlawful. Merely telling a person that he is being arrested under some section of some enactment does not give him sufficient information. The need to tell a person as to why he has been arrested does not come to an end by releasing him on bail. (b) RULE 2: RIGHT TO CONSULT A LAWYER Rule 2 postulates that there is an accusation against the person arrested against which he should be enabled to defend himself by engaging a legal practitioner of his choice. This is mandatory.9 Some railway porters offered satyagrahaat a railway station. They were arrested, tried and convicted under certain provisions of the Railways Act. No information was given to them about the date of trial, nor were they told that under Art. 22(1), they had a right to consult, and be defended by, a legal practitioner. It was held that in these circumstances, Art. 22(1) had been violated and the trial was vitiated.10 In State of Madhya Pradesh v. Shobharam, 11 the Supreme Court held that a person arrested on accusation of a crime becomes entitled to be defended by a counsel at the trial and this right is not lost even if he is released on bail, or is tried by a court which has no power to impose a sentence of imprisonment. Thus, a provision barring a lawyer from appearing before a Nyaya Panchayat would be void to the extent it denies a Page 1314 person arrested the right to be defended by a lawyer of his choice in a trial for the crime for which he has been arrested. If, however, no request for being represented by a lawyer has been made, and so no such request has been turned down, then there is no breach of the Fundamental Right contained in Art. 22(1).12 The Supreme Court has observed that the arrested person has a right, upon request, to have someone informed and to consult privately with a lawyer. These rights are inherent in Arts. 21 and 22(2) of the Constitution.13 The Court has directed that these rights of the arrestee be \"recognised and scrupulously protected\". The Court has laid down certain guidelines for the effective enforcement of these Fundamental Rights. In order to effectuate the right to consult a lawyer of his choice properly and reasonably, it is necessary that such legal practitioner is allowed the facility to consult the accused without the hearing of the police. A court cannot therefore direct consultation between the accused and his counsel in the presence of the police.14 The police may, however, be present so as to ensure that the accused does not abscond from custody, or do anything which may be objectionable otherwise. The lawyer whom the accused has engaged for his defence cannot be put under a threat of criminal prosecution, so that he cannot discharge his professional duty of defending his client in a fearless manner.15 The right to consult a legal practitioner starts right from the day of arrest.16 The right arises as soon as a person is arrested. According to Iyer, J., in Nandini Satpathy,17 Art. 22(1) does not mean that a person who is not under arrest or custody can be denied the right to consult an advocate of his choice. The spirit and sense of Art. 22(1) is that it is fundamental to the rule of law that the services of a lawyer shall be available for consultation to any accused person under \"circumstances of near custodial interrogation\".",

    "content": "to Iyer, J., in Nandini Satpathy,17 Art. 22(1) does not mean that a person who is not under arrest or custody can be denied the right to consult an advocate of his choice. The spirit and sense of Art. 22(1) is that it is fundamental to the rule of law that the services of a lawyer shall be available for consultation to any accused person under \"circumstances of near custodial interrogation\". Moreover, the right against self-incrimination18 is best promoted by conceding to the accused the right to consult a legal practitioner of his choice. Reading Arts. 20(3) and 22(1) together, it will be prudent for the police to permit the advocate of the accused, if there be one, to be present at the time he is examined. If an accused person expressed the wish to have his lawyer by his side when his examination goes on, this facility should not be denied to him.19 A person who is arrested has a right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice. This provision does not say that this right is lost no sooner than he is released on bail. The word 'defended' clearly includes the exercise of the right so long as the effect of the arrest continues. Therefore, the Supreme Court has ruled (by a majority of 3:2) in Shobharam20 that the Constitution lays down a right to be defended by one's own counsel, and this right cannot be taken away by an ordinary law. It is not sufficient to say that a person who is exposed to fine and is not in danger of losing his personal liberty has no right to be defended by a lawyer. Hidayatullah, J., observed on this point as follows:21 \"Personal liberty is invaded by arrest and continues to be restrained during the period a person is on bail and it matters not whether there is or is not a possibility of imprisonment. A person arrested and put on his defence against a criminal charge which may result in penalty, is entitled to the right to defend himself with the aid of a counsel and any law that takes away this right offends against the Constitution.\" The Court declared unconstitutional a provision in the State Act which barred an arrested person to be defended by a lawyer of his choice. In this case, the person concerned was arrested by the police on the charge of trespass, an offence under S. 447 , IPC. He was then released on bail and was later brought for trial before the Nyaya Panchayat. The Panchayat imposed a fine on him as the Panchayat had no power to impose the punishment of imprisonment on him. Because of the above-mentioned impugned provision, he could not be defended by a lawyer before the Nyaya Panchayat. He challenged the provision. By majority, the provision was declared unconstitutional. A liberal view was taken of Art. 22(1). Once a person is arrested, and even if released on bail, he has a constitutional right to be defended by a lawyer although his personal liberty may not be in jeopardy. In the U.S.A., under the impact of the due process of law clause in the Constitution,22 there prevails a rule that in a criminal case where the defendant is unable to employ a counsel, and is himself incapable of Page 1315 adequately defending himself because of ignorance, feeble mindedness, illiteracy, etc., it is the duty of the court, whether requested or not, to assign a counsel for him.23 Initially, this rule was not followed in India except to the extent that, where in capital cases the accused had no means to defend himself, a counsel was to be provided to defend him. There was no rule of law that in every capital case where the accused was unrepresented, the trial would be vitiated. A court of appeal or revision could interfere if it found that the accused was so much handicapped for want of legal aid that the proceedings against him could be said to be a negation of fair trial. These rules were derived from S. 340 , Cr.P.C., and the rules and circulars of the High Courts.24 In Janardhan Reddy v. State of Hyderabad, 25 the Supreme Court taking the traditional view of Art. 22(1) ruled that \"the right to be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice\" could only mean a right of the accused to have the opportunity to engage a lawyer and does not guarantee an absolute right to be supplied with a lawyer by the State\". Since then, Art. 39A, a Directive Principle,26 has been added to the Constitution by the 42nd Constitutional Amendment.27S. 304(1) , Cr.P.C., 1973, has now been enacted,28 and the Supreme Court has adopted a new stance as to the interpretation of Art. 21.29 This has also led to a new judicial view as to providing legal aid to an accused at his trial.30 (c) RULE 3: PRODUCTION OF THE ARRESTED PERSON BEFORE A MAGISTRATE Rule 3, mentioned above, requires an arrested person to be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of his arrest. It thus ensures that a judicial mind is applied immediately to the legal authority of the person making the arrest and regularity of the procedure adopted by him. This is a mandatory provision.31 Where a person is arrested by a magistrate without a warrant, it is not sufficient for purposes of Art. 22(2) to produce the person arrested before the same magistrate who arrested him. The reason is that such a magistrate could not apply a judicial mind to the facts of the case as he would be like a judge in his own cause. The policy of the law is that the magistrate before whom a prisoner is produced must be in a position to bring an independent judgment to bear on the matter.32 A station officer arrested a person without a warrant on his own authority.",

    "content": "to produce the person arrested before the same magistrate who arrested him. The reason is that such a magistrate could not apply a judicial mind to the facts of the case as he would be like a judge in his own cause. The policy of the law is that the magistrate before whom a prisoner is produced must be in a position to bring an independent judgment to bear on the matter.32 A station officer arrested a person without a warrant on his own authority. Within a few minutes, the city magistrate came there in his executive capacity. The arrested person was produced before him and he remanded him to jail custody. Art. 22(2) was held to have been fulfilled as the arrest had not been made under the orders or supervision of the magistrate before whom the arrested person was produced.33 It is immaterial whether the magistrate sits in a Court or not at the time the arrested person is produced before him.34 The magistrate is not to act mechanically but should apply judicial mind to see whether the arrest of the person produced before him is legal, regular and in accordance with law. Otherwise, the protection afforded by Art. 22(2) would be meaningless.35 The provision for production of an arrested man before a magistrate is not to be treated as a mere formality but as purposeful and designed to enable the person arrested to be released on bail, or other provision made for his proper custody, pending investigation into the offences with which he is charged pending an enquiry or trial.36 In case the magistrate himself is a competent witness against the accused, the magistrate could not justifiably and legally make an order of remand of the accused, for he could not bring to bear an impartial mind upon the case.37 In Bhim Singh v. State of Jammu & Kashmir, 38 The Supreme Court has criticized in very strong terms the conduct of a magistrate who passed an order remanding the accused to police custody without the accused having been produced before him personally. The magistrate was not concerned that the person whom he was remanding to custody had not been produced before him. The magistrate acted in a very casual way. The Supreme Court considered it a great pity that the magistrate acted without any sense of responsibility or genuine concern for the liberty of the subject. The police officer acted deliberately and mala fide and the magistrate aided him either by colluding with him or by his casual attitude. This certainly was a gross violation of the constitutional rights of the accused under Arts. 21 and 22(2) and the Court ordered the State to pay Rs. 50,000/- to the concerned person as monetary compensation.39 Page 1316 The requirement to produce an arrested person before a magistrate may come to an end if he is released on bail.40 When an arrested person has been produced before a High Court and remanded to custody, it is not then necessary to produce him before a magistrate also.41 (d) RULE 4 : NO PERSON IS TO BE DETAINED IN CUSTODY BEYOND 24 HOURS WITHOUT THE AUTHORITY OF A MAGISTRATE The Supreme Court has strongly urged in Khatri v. State of Bihar, 42 that the constitutional requirement to produce an arrested person before a judicial magistrate within 24 hours of his arrest must be strictly and scrupulously observed. A person was arrested in Bombay on a warrant issued by the Speaker of the U.P. Legislative Assembly and was taken to Lucknow in custody to be produced before the Speaker to answer a charge of breach of privilege of the House. He was not produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of his arrest. The Supreme Court held in Gunpati v. Nafisul Hasan, 43 that this was a clear breach of the peremptory provisions of Art. 22(2) and hence the petitioner was released. The authority of this decision, shaken by the Court's pronouncement in Sharma v. Sinha, has again been rehabilitated by the Keshav Singh case.44 (e) NON-APPLICATION OF ARTS. 22(1) & 22(2) Art. 22(3) makes two exceptions. Arts. 22(1) and 22(2) do not apply to: (a) enemy aliens, and (b) to persons arrested or detained under a law providing for preventive detention.45 The key words in Arts. 22(1) and (2) are 'arrest' and 'detention'. These words have been interpreted to mean that the protection applies to such arrests as are effected on an allegation or accusation that the person arrested is suspected to have committed, or is likely to commit, an act of a criminal or quasi-criminal nature, or some activity prejudicial to public interest.46 These provisions would not, therefore, apply in case of arrest without a criminal accusation. These Articles do not, therefore, apply inter alia to the following cases where arrest is not connected with an accusation of an offence:-- (i) arrest of a defendant before judgment, or (ii) arrest of a judgment-debtor in execution of a decree under the Civil Procedure Code where the arrested person is produced not before a magistrate but the civil court which made the order; (iii) arrest under a revenue recovery legislation to recover arrears of revenue.47 (iv) Under the Abducted Persons (Recovery and Restoration) Act, 1949, persons abducted from Pakistan were rescued. Such persons were taken in custody and delivered to the custody of an officer-in-charge of a camp for the purpose of return to Pakistan. The Supreme Court ruled in State of Punjab v. Ajaib Singh, 48 that this was not the kind of arrest contemplated by Art. 22, because there was no allegation or accusation of any actual or apprehended commission by that person of any offence of a criminal or quasi-criminal nature.",

    "content": "Supreme Court ruled in State of Punjab v. Ajaib Singh, 48 that this was not the kind of arrest contemplated by Art. 22, because there was no allegation or accusation of any actual or apprehended commission by that person of any offence of a criminal or quasi-criminal nature. However, when a 13 year old boy was taken into custody against his will and kept imprisoned for several days although there was no case, cognizable or non-cognizable against him, the Delhi High Court held he had been arrested and detained in custody within the meaning of Art. 22. The court said that otherwise any police officer can 'pick up' anybody and detain him without having to fulfil the requirements of Article 22 simply by saying that he was not arrested him in the technical sense.49 When a foreigner enters India illegally and is ordered to leave India but fails to do so, his arrest for purposes of deportation does not fall under Art. 22. The foreigner concerned had no right to enter and remain within India. The constitutional protection against illegal deprivation of personal liberty construed in a practical way cannot entitle non-citizens to remain in India contrary to the law governing the foreigners.50 A judicial view has been expressed that Arts. 22(1) and (2) provide protection against the act of an executive or non-judicial authority. These Articles apply when a person is arrested without, and not under, a court warrant. The reason is that the warrant ex facie sets out the reasons for the arrest, and the arrested person Page 1317 is to be produced before the court issuing the warrant. Thus, a judicial mind has already been applied at the time of issuing the warrant. On the other hand, in case of arrest without a court warrant, there is need for application of a judicial mind as soon as possible after arrest.51 B. PREVENTIVE DETENTION Preventive detention means detention of a person without trial and conviction by a court, but merely on suspicion in the mind of an executive authority. Preventive detention is fundamentally and qualitatively different from imprisonment after trial and conviction in a criminal court. Preventive detention and prosecution for an offence are not synonymous. In conviction, an accused is sought to be punished for a past act. The offence has to be proved in the court beyond reasonable doubt. In preventive detention, on the other hand, a person is detained without trial in the subjective satisfaction of the executive to prevent him for committing an undesirable act in future. The idea is not to punish him for his past acts. \"In preventive detention, the past act is merely the material for inference about the future course of probable conduct on the part of the detenu.\" Preventive detention is thus preventive, not punitive, in theory. Preventive detention is not to punish an individual for any wrong done by him, but at curtailing his liberty, with a view to preventing him from committing certain injurious activities in future.52 As the Supreme Court has observed in Senthil:53 \"Whereas punitive incarceration is after trial on the allegations made against a person, preventive detention is without trial into the allegations made against him.\" Preventive Detention has not been unknown in other democratic countries like Britain, U.S.A. and Canada, but only as a war-time, and not a peace-time, measure.54 In India, the Constitution itself visualizes the possibility of a law of preventive detention. In spite of all the emphasis on individual liberty, it has been found necessary in India to resort to preventive detention during peace-time because of unstable law and order situation in the country.55 Constitutional Provisions A law for preventive detention can be enacted by Parliament exclusively under entry 9, List I, for reasons connected with defence, foreign affairs, or the security of India.56 Further, under entry 3, List III, Parliament as well as the State Legislatures can concurrently make a law for preventive detention for reasons connected with security of a State, maintenance of public order, or maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community.57 Parliament thus has a wide legislative jurisdiction in the matter of preventive detention as it can enact a law providing for preventive detention for reasons connected with all the six heads mentioned in Lists I and III. But the above-mentioned entries do not exhaust the entire legislative area of Parliament with respect to preventive detention on other grounds. Besides, Parliament can enact, in the exercise of its residuary power,58a law providing for preventive detention on any other ground. For example, Parliament has enacted the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 (COFEPOSA) under its residuary power read with Entry 36, List I.59 Clauses (4) to (7) of Art. 22 lay down a few safeguards, and provide for minimum procedure, which must be observed in any case of preventive detention. If a law of preventive detention, or administrative action relating thereto, infringes any of these safeguards, then the law or the action would be invalid as infringing the Fundamental Right of the detainee. It is immaterial whether or not these constitutional safeguards are incorporated in the law authorising Page 1318 preventive detention, because even if they are not, they would be deemed to be part of the law as a superimposition by the Constitution which is the supreme law of the land. Some semblance of natural justice has been woven into the fabric of preventive detention by these constitutional provisions, and some protection has been provided to a person whose personal liberty has been taken away through an administrative order. Besides, as already stated, a law of preventive detention will also be subject to the constraints of Arts. 19 and 21.60 The scope and ambit of safeguards provided by Arts. 22(4) to (7), and as evolved by the courts through interpretative process can be discussed under the following several heads. It may be noted that the Supreme Court has developed certain norms out of Arts.",

It may be noted that the Supreme Court has developed certain norms out of Arts. 22(4) to 22(7) with a view to protect the personal liberty of detenu against bureaucratic lethargy, insensitivity, red tape and routine approach. (a) COMMUNICATION OF GROUNDS TO THE DETENU Art. 22(5) runs as follows: \"When any person is detained in pursuance of an order made under any law providing for preventive detention, the authority making the order shall, as soon as may be, communicate to such person the grounds on which the order has been made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order.\" Art. 22(5) has two limbs. One, the detaining authority is to communicate to the detenu the grounds of his detention 'as soon as may be'. Two, the detenu is to be afforded 'the earliest opportunity' of making a representation against the order of detention. This is natural justice woven into the fabric of preventive detention by the Constitution.61 These are the rights granted to the detenu by Art. 22(5). If any of these rights is violated, the detention order would become bad. According to the Supreme Court in Abdul Karim v. State of West Bengal, 62 \"The right of representation under Art. 22(5) is a valuable constitutional right and is not a mere formality.\" There is an integral relation between these two limbs, viz., grounds for his detention are to be communicated to the detenu so as to enable him to defend himself. From this postulate, the courts have drawn a number of propositions to ensure that the detaining authority communicates grounds to the detenu in such manner that his constitutional right to make a representation against his detention is exercised effectively. Under Art. 22(5), communication of grounds means communication to the detenu of all the basic facts, documents and materials which went into the subjective satisfaction of the authority to detain him.63 The detention order becomes bad if any factual components constituting the real grounds for detention are not fairly and fully put across to the detenu, the reason being that if some facts are held back from him, his right to make an effective representation against his detention is infringed.64 The Supreme Court has emphasized that Art. 22(5) vests a real, and not an imaginary or illusory, right in the detenu. The communication of facts is the cornerstone of his right of representation and an order of detention passed on uncommunicated materials is unfair and illegal. The Courts protect this right of the detenus quite jealously.65 In Khudiram Das v. State of West Bengal, 66 in the grounds of detention communicated to the detenu, three incidents were mentioned. The district magistrate had before him the detenu's history-sheet at the time of making the detention order, but none of the injurious facts contained therein was communicated to him. The detenu argued that the magistrate was influenced in making the order by the material in the history-sheet which was not communicated to him and, thus, his right under Art. 22(5) was infringed. The magistrate asserted in an affidavit that beyond the three grounds communicated, he did not take any material from the history-sheet into account in passing the order. The State asserted that the court should accept the affidavit of the magistrate and should not probe into the nature of the material before the district magistrate or whether or not he was influenced by it in making the detention order. The Supreme Court rejected this argument, saying that, as the custodian of the citizens' Fundamental Rights, it was its duty to satisfy itself whether there were other materials which could have influenced the Page 1319 district magistrate in arriving at his subjective satisfaction but which he did not communicate to the detenu. Whether the other materials on record had or had not any effect on his mind could not be decided solely on the basis of the magistrate's ipse dixit. Art 22(5) insists that all basic facts and particulars which influenced the detaining authority in arriving at its satisfaction must be communicated to the detenu. It is, therefore, the duty of the court to examine what were the basic facts and materials which actually weighed with the district magistrate in reaching his satisfaction and, to this end, the court can require him to produce before it the entire record of the case which was before him. If there was before the district magistrate material against the detenu of a highly damaging character and having nexus and relevancy with the object of detention, then because of the proximity with the time when the subjective satisfaction forming the basis of the detention order was arrived at, it would be legitimate for the court to infer that such material must have influenced him in arriving at his subjective satisfaction and, in such a case, the court would refuse to accept the bald statement of the magistrate that he did not take such material into account. It is elementary that human mind does not function in compartments. All such material should be communicated to the detenu, and failure to do so would vitiate the detention. In Prakash Chandra,67 an order of detention was passed under S. 3(1)Cofeposa.68 The Supreme Court, while examining the concept of \"grounds\" used in Art. 22(5), observed that the word \"grounds\" has to receive an interpretation which would keep it meaningfully in tune with the contemporary notions. The expression \"grounds\" includes not only conclusion of facts but also all the \"basic facts\" on which those conclusions were founded.",

    "content": "expression \"grounds\" includes not only conclusion of facts but also all the \"basic facts\" on which those conclusions were founded. On this point, the Supreme Court has observed in Sophia:69 \"A representation can be made and the order of detention can be assailed only when all the grounds on which the order is based are communicated to the detenu and the material on which those grounds are based are also disclosed and copies thereof are supplied to the person detained in his own language.\" The Court has ruled in this case that the word \"grounds\" used in Art. 22(5) mean not only the narration or conclusions of facts, but also all materials on which those facts are conclusions which constitute the \"grounds\" are based. An effective representation can be made against the detention order only when copies of the material documents which were considered and relied upon by the detaining authority in forming his opinion that the detenu be detained were supplied to him. The detenu can make an effective representation only after reading and understanding the contents of these documents. Where the document supplied was in Tamil, a language which was not known to the detenu, he is deprived of the right to make an effective representation.70 In Sophia, because of non-supply of documents which were taken into consideration and looked into by the detaining authority and on the basis of which he felt satisfied that the detention order be made, the detention order was quashed. In the instant case, the order was made under S. 3(1) of Cofeposa. In a number of cases, the proposition has been reiterated by the Supreme Court that the documents relied upon to make, or referred to in the grounds for, the detention order form an integral part of the grounds and must be supplied to the detenu pari passu the grounds of detention. Documents may not be supplied alongwith the grounds but must be supplied within a reasonable time, or within the time fixed for the purpose in the relevant law of preventive detention for the supply of the grounds.71 The words 'as soon as may be' in Art. 22(5) indicate a positive action on the part of the detaining authority in supplying the grounds of detention. This means that the detaining authority must communicate the grounds to the detenu with reasonable despatch. There should not be any delay on the part of the detaining authority in supplying the grounds on which the order of detention was based. Failure to communicate the grounds within a reasonable time vitiates the detention. It is for the court to consider whether, in the circumstances of the case, the time taken to communicate the grounds was 'reasonable' or more than reasonable.72 There can be no hard and fast rule as to the measure of reasonable time; each case [e1][e2]has to be considered Page 1320 on its own facts as to whether there was culpable delay in dealing with the representation of the detenu.73 There have been many cases in which delay in supplying grounds forming the basis of subjective satisfaction to pass the order of preventive detention has led to the quashing of the detention orders.74 Now, in the preventive detention law itself, a time period is fixed to communicate the grounds, e.g., S. 3(3) of the COFEPOSA requires the grounds of the detention to be communicated to the detenu as soon as may be, but \"ordinarily not later than five days and in exceptional circumstances and for reasons to be recorded in writing, not later than fifteen days, from the date of detention\".75 This provision shows that it is obligatory on the detaining authority to communicate to the detenu, the grounds on which the order of detention has been made promptly. Thus, without exceptional circumstances, delay beyond five days would be fatal to the validity of the order. When the detaining authority takes longer than 5 days, he has to record reasons as to why the grounds of detention could not be communicated within 5 days. The grounds have to be satisfactory. If there is no acceptable or satisfactory explanation for the delay beyond five days, detention becomes vitiated.76 In this connection, the Court has observed:77 \"It is not permissible, in matters relating to personal liberty and freedom of a citizen, to take either a liberal or a generous view of the lapses on the part of the officers. In matters where the liberty of the citizens is involved, it is necessary for the officers to act with utmost expedition and in strict compliance with the mandatory provisions of law.\" Explaining the significance of the provision, the court has insisted that the provision has to be interpreted literally. If the original time of 5 days has to be extended, such extension must be supported by an order recording reasons. If the reasons are not so recorded, the order of detention will automatically fail. \"Even if reasons are recorded they have to inspire confidence in the court and are subject to legal scrutiny. If the reasons are unsatisfactory, courts would still quash the order of detention.\"78 The Supreme Court has also ruled that when there are exceptional circumstances for the delay, the same must be communicated to the detenu.79 Thus, if the detention is on the ground that the detenu is indulging in manufacture or transport or sale of arrack then that by itself would not become an activity prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. But if the arrack sold by the detenu is dangerous to public health then under the Act80, it becomes an activity prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.",

    "content": "if the arrack sold by the detenu is dangerous to public health then under the Act80, it becomes an activity prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. If the detaining authority is satisfied on material available to it that the arrack dealt with by the detenu is arrack which is dangerous to public health, such material, whether in the form of report of the Chemical Examiner or otherwise, must be supplied to the detenu to afford him an opportunity to make an effective representation.81 All the grounds of detention must be communicated in one instalment. Once the grounds have been conveyed to the detenu, fresh, new or additional grounds cannot be added thereto later to strengthen the original detention order.82 The reason is that Art. 22(5) requires that all the grounds which operated to create the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority to issue the detention order must be communicated to the detenu and nothing should be held back. Therefore, if the 'additional' grounds were non-existent at the time the detention order was made, then these were not elements to bring about the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority to make the detention order in question and hence they were irrelevant. On the other hand, if these grounds were in existence at that time, their non-communication earlier would amount to a breach of Art. 22(5) insofar as they were not communicated to the detenu 'as soon as may be'. The prohibition to serve the additional grounds after the initial communication of grounds does not, however, extend to furnishing of additional facts, data or particulars on which the grounds were based. The test, therefore, is whether the subsequent communication contains any additional 'grounds' or only additional 'facts' on which the grounds originally conveyed were based. But even specification of additional 'facts' must be within a reasonable time-limit, otherwise the detenu's right under Art. 22(5) to make a representation is breached.83 The efficacy of the above norms regarding communication of grounds and facts to the detenu is diluted to some extent by Art. 22(6) which permits the detaining authority to withhold those facts which it considers not desirable to disclose in public interest. However, subject to a claim of privilege under Art. 22(6), the communication of particulars should be as full and adequate as circumstances permit. A distinction has been drawn here between 'facts' and 'grounds' of detention. The detaining authority can withhold 'facts' in public interest but not the 'grounds'. All 'grounds' of detention must be disclosed to the detenu. Page 1321 It is the obligation of the detaining authority, and of none else, to consider whether disclosure of any facts is against public interest. It is not necessary for the detaining authority to disclose to the detenu its decision to withhold disclosure of some facts under Art. 22(6), and the ambit of non-disclosure.84 There is nothing wrong in the detaining authority placing before the advisory board the facts not supplied to the detenu in public interest.85 The detenu is not entitled to know the confidential sources of information on which the detention order is based. \"What is necessary for the making of an effective representation is the disclosure of the material and not the source thereof\". Nor is the evidence collected against the detenu is to be disclosed to him. In the grounds given to the detenu all the material details necessary to make an effective order have to be given.86 As a general rule, a detenu cannot seek a writ of mandamus challenging an order of detention passed by a detaining authority under the relevant \"preventive detention\" law, if he does not surrender and is not served with an order of detention and the grounds in support of such order. Interference by a writ court at the pre-execution or pre-arrest stage to set aside an order of detention can take place only if the court is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances.87 (b) RIGHT TO MAKE REPRESENTATION Another norm developed by the courts to effectuate the right guaranteed to the detenu by Art. 22(5) to make representation against his detention is that the grounds conveyed to him must not be vague or inadequate. The detaining authority is under a constitutional duty to furnish reasonably definite grounds to the detenu as well as adequate particulars of the grounds of detention. The Courts have emphasized that the right to make representation given to the detenu by the Constitution is not 'illusory'. The detenu should be placed in a position so that he can make an effective representation against his detention and he cannot do so unless the grounds of detention are communicated to him in clear and unambiguous terms giving as much particulars as possible. Accordingly, the inadequacy or vagueness of the grounds from the point of view of the detenu's right to make an effective representation becomes a justiciable matter. If the grounds supplied to him are inadequate or vague, the detenu is entitled to be released.88 A ground is not vague if it is capable of being intelligently undersood and is sufficiently definite to enable the detenu to make an effective representation.89 Further, if the grounds are vague or inadequate, the detenu has a right to ask for further particulars but that is immaterial. The order may be declared invalid even though the detenu does not ask for further particulars. His failure to do so may be relevant only for considering the question whether the grounds are vague or not.90 A person was detained on the ground that he made speeches which, in the opinion of the detaining authority, were calculated to prejudice the maintenance of public order. Extracts from the speeches were not given but the time and place when and where they were delivered were communicated to the detenu. The detenu contended that, in the absence of indication of the offending passages in the speeches, he could not make an effective representation.",

    "content": "from the speeches were not given but the time and place when and where they were delivered were communicated to the detenu. The detenu contended that, in the absence of indication of the offending passages in the speeches, he could not make an effective representation. The Supreme Court held by a majority that the particulars communicated to the detenu were sufficient to enable him to make a representation. The minority view, however, was that at least the gist of the speeches should have been communicated to the detenu so that he could show that no reasonable person could draw the inference from them which was drawn by the detaining authority.91 In course of time, the Courts' attitude in this respect appears to have stiffened and they have started to adopt a more scrutinising approach.92 Thus, the ground that the detenu was a man of 'desperate habits and dangerous character' has been held to be vague.93 Grounds served on the detenu in a language which could not be interpreted by a layman but needed lawyer's assistance were held vague. As legal aid is denied to a detenu, the detaining authority should make his measures clear beyond doubt and not leave the detenu to his own resources to interpret the grounds.94 Grounds were served on a detenu in the English language which he did not know. He asked for a Hindi Page 1322 version of the grounds which was not supplied to him. Quashing his detention, the Supreme Court emphasized that to enable the detenu to make an effective representation, he should have knowledge of the grounds of detention. Communication envisages bringing home to the detenu effective knowledge of the facts and circumstances on which the order was based. To a person not conversant with the English language, the grounds must be explained in a language which he understands.1 In Icchu Devi v. Union of India, 2 a smuggler detained under COFEPOSA challenged his detention on several grounds, of which one proved to be fatal, viz., the detaining authority had not served on the detenu copies of several documents on which the authority had relied in thegrounds of detention. The high water of this case is the deep concern expressed by the Supreme Court for the upholding of personal liberty. The Court ruled that, in the instant case, continued detention of the petitioner became illegal because of non-compliance with statutory and constitutional requirements. On the question of supply of documents, to enable a detenu to make a representation, the Court has ruled in Kamarunnissa v. Union of India, 3 that it is not sufficient to show that the detenu was not supplied the copies of some of the documents in time on demand but it must further be shown that the non-supply of the documents in question has impaired his right to make an effective and purposeful representation against his detention. If out of the several grounds, even one ground is found to be vague or inadequate, the right of the detenu to make a representation is infringed, and the detention becomes invalid.4 To get over this difficulty, a statutory strategy has been evolved. Thus, S. 5A of NSA provides that a detention order made on two or more grounds is to be deemed to have been made separately on each of such grounds. This means that if one of the grounds is quashed for any reason whatsoever, the order would not fall if the other ground subsists.5 (c) CONSIDERATION OF THE REPRESENTATION Art. 22(5) does not say as to whom the representation is to be made, or, what is to be done with it. However, in order to make Art. 22(5) meaningful and convert it into a safeguard to the detenu, the Supreme Court has interpreted Art. 22(5) to mean that the government must consider the detenu's representation before sending it to the advisory board. The representation must be signed and dated otherwise it cannot be treated as a representation within the meaning of Art. 22(5).6 The Court has reasoned that the detenu's right to make representation would be illusory if the government were not obligated to consider it. Consideration of detenu's representation by the government is a safeguard in addition to the consideration of his case by the advisory board. \"It goes without saying that the constitutional right to make a representation guaranteed by Art. 22(5) must be taken to include by necessary implication the constitutional right to a proper consideration of the representation by the authority to whom it is made. The right of representation under Art. 22(5) is a valuable constitutional right and is not a mere formality.\"7 The Supreme Court has emphasized again and again that the ultimate objective of Art. 22(5) is the most speedy consideration of the detenu's representation by the concerned authorities. Without its expeditious consideration with a sense of urgency, the basic purpose of affording the earliest opportunity of making the representation is likely to be defeated. The representation submitted by a detenu must be considered and disposed of by the concerned authority with a sense of urgency without avoidable delay. This consideration of representation by the detaining authority is independent of the reference to the Advisory Board.8 The Supreme Court has emphasized that if the representation is received before the case is referred to the advisory board, the same must be considered before the matter is referred to the advisory board. However, if there is no reasonable time to consider and dispose of the representation before referring Page 1323 the case to the advisory board, the same may be referred to the advisory board, but the detaining authority has to consider the same after the advisory board has made its report.9 The representation has to be considered by the concerned authority independently of the report of the advisory board[e3].10 It is quite possible that on considering the representation, the government may itself take the view that it is no longer necessary to detain the detenu.",

    "content": "that case, it may release him and nothing will be left then to refer to the advisory board. It violates Art. 22(5) if the government merely forwards the detenu's representation to the advisory board without itself considering it first.11 Appointment of the advisory board does not absolve the detaining authority of the obligation of first considering the representation itself. Thus, there are two distinct obligations, independent of each other, imposed on the government: (1) to give the detenu the earliest opportunity to make a representation and consider it expeditiously, (2) to refer the case to an advisory board and obtain its report. As the Supreme Court has observed in Hardhan Saha v. State of West Bengal :12 \"If the representation of the detenu is received before the matter is referred to the Advisory Board, the detaining authority considers the representation. If the representation is made after the matter has been referred to the Advisory Board, the detaining authority will consider it before it will send representation to the Advisory Board.\" The Supreme Court has held that non-consideration by the government of a representation filed by a counsel on behalf of a detenu vitiates his detention. Representation by the counsel was representation by the detenu himself and it ought to have been considered by the authority concerned.13 The order of preventive detention was made by the Home Minister, but the detenu's representation was rejected by the Secretary. The Supreme Court held that the Secretary had no jurisdiction to do so and that the detenu's further detention became invalid.14 Further, the Supreme Court has imposed another obligation on the government, viz., the government should consider detenu's representation promptly and expeditiously. The fact that under Art. 22(5), the earliest opportunity is to be afforded to the detenu to make a representation necessarily implies that, as and when it is made, it should be dealt with promptly.15 The right of the detenu to make a representation at the earliest opportunity will lose all its purpose and meaning, and will be reduced to a farce and an empty formality, if the government were to unduly delay giving consideration to the representation. The Supreme Court has emphasized that when the liberty of a person is in peril, immediate action by relevant authorities is a desideratum.16 The Supreme Court has underlined the need for expeditious consideration of the detenu's representation in the following words:17 \"The personal liberty of a person is at stake. Any delay would not only be an irresponsible act on the part of the appropriate authority but also unconstitutional because the Constitution enshrines the Fundamental Right of a detenu to have his representation considered and it is imperative that when the liberty of a person is in peril immediate action should be taken by the relevant authorities.\" The Court has refused to prescribe a rigid time-limit for the purpose. It thus depends on the facts and circumstances of each case whether government considered the representation promptly or not. In this matter, no delay should be caused because of negligence, callous inaction, avoidable red tapism and unduly protracted procrastination.18 What is reasonable dispatch depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and no hard and fast rule can be laid down in this regard. Detention may not be declared bad if the government is able to give a satisfactory explanation for the delay Page 1324 on its part to consider the detenu's representation. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Court can certainly consider whether the delay was occasioned due to permissible reasons or unavoidable causes. But detention may be held bad, even if it was valid ab initio, if the Court finds government explanation for delay vague and unsatisfactory.19 Thus, an unexplained delay of 17 days in government considering detenu's representation was held to vitiate detention.20 On the other hand, a delay of 6 weeks was not held to be sufficient ground to vitiate the detention since there was adequate explanation for the delay.21 The Supreme Court has often trenchantly criticized the lethargic attitude of the bureaucracy in dealing with the detenu's representation.22 On this point, the Supreme Court has explained the position in Rajammal,23 thus: \"The position, therefore, now is that if delay was caused on account of any indifference or lapse in considering the representation such delay will adversely affect further detention of the prisoner. In other words, it is for the authority concerned to explain the delay, if any, in disposing the representation. It is not enough to say that the delay was very short. Even longer delay can as well be explained. So the test is not the duration or range of delay, but how it is explained by the authority concerned.\" In the instant case, an order made under the State law was quashed because there was an unexplained delay of 5 days in considering the representation of the detenu. The Court refused to accept the statement that the Minister was on tour as a \"justifiable explanation\", when the liberty of a citizen guaranteed by Art. 21 was involved, \"Absence of the Minister at the Headquarters is not sufficient to justify the delay.\" The Court has clarified that the question of delay in considering a detenu's representation is to be decided not by applying any rigid or inflexible rule or any \"set formula\" or by a mere arithmetical counting of dates\". This matter is decided by scrutiny of facts and circumstances of each case--whether there was \"any remissness, indifference or avoidable delay\" on the part of the detaining authority/government in dealing with the representation.",

    "content": "the Court is satisfied that the delay was occasioned not by any lack of diligence or promptness of attention on the part of the party concerned, but due to unavoidable circumstances or reasons entirely beyond his control, such delay will not be treated as furnishing a ground for the grant of relief to the detenu against his continued detention.\"24 Delay in disposing of subsequent representations or any delay in communicating the decision on such representation however will not vitiate the order of detention.25 Also if the representation is handed over to or served on a person who is not authorised to receive it the authority concerned cannot be held responsible if any delay is occasioned on account of inaction by such unauthorised person.26 Even when the detenu's representation is received after the advisory board has considered his case and held his detention to be justified, the government is still obligated to consider the representation, for it is not bound to accept the board's opinion automatically and may still take the view, after considering his representation, that it was no longer necessary to detain him.27 While the Supreme Court has emphasized that consideration of the detenu's representation should be real, proper, not casual or mechanical, it has refused to lay down that the government or the advisory board should pass a speaking order disclosing reasons for rejecting the representation.28 But there is no hard-and-fast rule that the appropriate Government called upon to take a decision under S. 11 of COFEPOSA should necessarily have copies of all the documents relied upon by the detaining authority with the translated version thereof.29 The detenu made a representation against his detention to the detaining authority and requested him to send its copies to the Central and the State Governments for their consideration. This was not done. Holding that not sending a copy of the detenu's representation to the Central Government has resulted in the violation of his statutory right of his representation being considered by the Central Government. The Supreme Court pointed out that the law of preventive detention is harsh to the person detained and, therefore, it must be strictly construed. The right of the detenu to make a representation against his detention flows from Art. 22(5). The representation is to be made to the authority having power to rescind or revoke the decision. Under S. 11 of the COFEPOSA read with S. 21of the General Clauses Act, three authorities are empowered to revoke a detention order,viz., the officer making the order, the State Government if the detaining officer is a State official and the Central Government. The Court has ruled that the action of the Page 1325 detaining authority in not taking out copies of the detenu's representation, and sending the same to the Central Government was not reasonable. A person in preventive detention suffers from certain handicaps. If he makes a request to forward copies of his representation to the State and Central Governments, \"it would be a denial of his right to represent to the Central Government if the detaining authority as well as the State Government refuse to accede to his request and omit to forward his representation to the Central Government for consideration\". The Court failed to understand \"why such a technical and rigid view\" is taken by the authority in the matter of personal liberty when a person is kept in preventive detention.30 The detenu sent his representation to the advisory board. The board considered the representation and sent its opinion to the Central Government. Thereafter the government confirmed the order, but did not consider the detenu's representation. Thus, there was no independent consideration of the detenu's representation by the government at any time. The Court has ruled in Gracy v. State of Kerala, 31 that there has been breach of the detenu's right under Art. 22(5). The obligation of the government to consider the representation is different, and in addition to the obligation of the board to consider the same. The detenu's right to have the representation considered by the government under Art. 22(5) is independent of the consideration of the detenu's case and his representation by the advisory board. Art. 22(5) casts a dual obligation on the detaining authority viz.: (i) to communicate the grounds of detention to the detenu at the earliest; (ii) to afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the detention order which implies the duty to consider and decide the representation when made, as soon as possible. Although an infraction of the detenu's right to make a representation and its disposal by the authorities does not vitiate an order of detention passed by the detaining authority, it renders the continued detention illegal.32 (d) ADVISORY BOARD Another safeguard is provided by Art. 22(4) to a detenu under preventive detention. Under Art. 22(4)(a), preventive detention for over three months is possible only when an advisory board holds that, in its opinion, there is sufficient cause for such detention. The board must report before the expiry of three months. If the report is not made within three months of the date of detention, the detention would become illegal.33 The board is to consist of persons who are, or have been, or are qualified to act as the High Court Judges. For preventive detention up to three months, no reference to such a board is necessary. Under Art. 22(7)(c), Parliament is authorised to prescribe the procedure to be followed by an advisory board. From the tenor of Art. 22(4)(a), it is clear that a law of preventive detention may provide for detention up to three months without the safeguard of an advisory board. The 44th Constitutional Amendment enacted by Parliament in 1978,34 amended Arts.",

    "content": "to (7) so as to introduce therein a few more safeguards for the detenu as follows: (a) the maximum period for which a person may be detained without obtaining the opinion of the advisory board has been reduced from 3 to 2 months; (b) no person is to be kept in detention beyond two months unless the advisory board reports that in its opinion there is sufficient cause for such detention; (c) an advisory board is to consist of a chairman and not less than two other members; (d) the chairman of the board has to be a serving judge of the appropriate High Court and the other members may be serving or retired High Court Judges; (e) the board is to be constitutied in accordance with the recommendations of the Chief Justice of the appropriate High Court; (f) no person is to be kept in preventive detention beyond the maximum period prescribed by any law made by Parliament. The reason for making the above changes in the composition of the advisory board is to make the board Page 1326 independent of the executive so that it may look into a case of preventive detention objectively. But these constitutional amendments have not yet been effectuated and Arts. 22(4) to (7) still continue to be as they were before the 44th Amendment. (e) CONFIRMATION OF THE DETENTION ORDER From the wordings of Art. 22(4), the Supreme Court has spelled out the rule that not only the advisory board should report within three months of the date of detention order that, in its opinion, there is sufficient cause for the detention of the detenu, but also the government should itself confirm and extend the period of detention (beyond three months) within the three months time-limit. Failure on the part of the government to do so will render the detention invalid as soon as three months elapse and any subsequent action by the government cannot have the effect of extending the period of detention beyond three months. While confirming the order of detention, the government has not only to peruse the report of the advisory board, but apply its mind to the material on record.35 It is also necessary that the order of confirmation be in writing and be communicated to the detenu. The detenu whose freedom is in jeopardy is entitled to know the result of his representation. But lack of communication to him is merely an irregularity and it does not invalidate an otherwise valid detention.36 (f) PARLIAMENT'S POWER TO DISPENSE WITH ADVISORY BOARDS Under Art. 22(7)(a), Parliament may by law prescribe \"the circumstances under which, and the class or classes of cases in which, a person may be detained for a period longer than three months\" without referring his case to an advisory board under Art. 22(4)(a). The interpretation of this clause has caused some difficulty. In Gopalan, the Supreme Court held by majority that the word and between 'circumstances' and 'class' in this clause was used not conjunctively but disjunctively (i.e. it meant 'or', not 'and'). Therefore, it was not obligatory on Parliament to lay down both the 'circumstances' and 'classes', but could lay down either 'circumstances' or 'classes', of cases in which a person could be detained for more than three months without referring his case to an advisory board. But the Supreme Court overruled this view in Sambhu Nath Sarkar v. State of West Bengal .37 There s. 17A of MISA38 narrated five of the six heads mentioned in the Constitution39 for which a law of preventive detention could be made as the circumstances in which reference to an advisory board was not necessary. The Court declared the section unconstitutional. It treated Art. 22(7)(a) as an exception to Art. 22(4). The intercession of an advisory board in preventive detention cases for over three months being the normal rule, its dispensation could be justified only in exceptional and extraordinary cases. Therefore, the law under Art. 22(7)(a) would by its nature be a drastic law and should, therefore, apply to exceptional circumstances and exceptional activities, expressly and in precise terms prescribed by Parliament. Therefore, the word and in Art. 22(7)(a) should be interpreted to have its ordinary conjunctive sense requiring Parliament to prescribe both the 'circumstances' under which, and the 'class of cases' in which only, consideration by the Board could be dispensed with. Merely repeating verbatim the heads of legislation for preventive detention as given in entry 9 in List I and entry 3, List III40 would not satisfy Art. 22(7)(a). It would neither be prescribing 'circumstances' nor the 'classes of cases' to which only, as against the rest of the individuals, the safeguard of intercession of an independent body does not apply. Parliament must apply its mind and prescribe specific situations and types of cases which require a drastic treatment by way of dispensation of the advisory board. This pronouncement of the Court is in line with the judicial philosophy of protecting freedoms of the individuals against undue interference by the Legislature and the Executive. The result of this pronouncement is to circumscribe somewhat Parliament's scope of curtailing the safeguard of an advisory board in preventive detention cases. It may also be noted that only Parliament, and not a State Legislature, is entitled to legislate under Art. 22(7)(a) for dispensation of an advisory board in cases of preventive detention for over three months. Page 1327 Section 9 of COFEPOSA lays downs the cases in which, and the circumstances under which, persons may be detained for longer than 3 months but not exceeding 6 months without obtaining the opinion of the advisory board.41 (g) MAXIMUM PERIOD OF DETENTION Art. 22(4)(a) says that no person can be detained beyond the maximum period prescribed by any law made by Parliament. Under Art. 22(7)(b), Parliament may by law prescribe the maximum period of detention for which any person can be detained.",

Under Art. 22(7)(b), Parliament may by law prescribe the maximum period of detention for which any person can be detained. This provision has been held to be merely permissive, and it does not oblige Parliament to prescribe any maximum period of detention. It has also been held that it is not necessary for Parliament to fix the maximum period for detention in terms of years, months or days. It is valid to fix such period in terms of a specific event, as for example, until the expiry of the emergency proclaimed under Art. 352.42 C. LAWS AUTHORISING PREVENTIVE DETENTION There exist a number of Central and State laws authorising preventive detention on various grounds. Some of these are mentioned below. (i) Central Laws The salient features of three Central Laws are discussed below. (a) NATIONAL SECURITY ACT Immediately after the inauguration of the Constitution, Parliament enacted the Preventive Detention Act, 1950. It was deemed to be a temporary measure but it remained in operation till December 31, 1969, when it was allowed to expire. It was this Act which gave rise to the famous (or, now infamous) Gopalan case.43Then was enacted the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971, (MISA). This Act lasted until 1977. Thereafter, Parliament enacted the National Security Act, 1980, (NSA). This is the prevailing law on preventive detention. The provisions of the Act of 1950 were rather severe, but, with the passage of time, the law of preventive detention has been somewhat liberalised, especially, in its procedural aspects, with a view to give better safeguards to the detenu. The salient feature of NSA is that an order of preventive detention can be made by the Central or State Government if it is satisfied with respect to any person that it is necessary to do so to prevent him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the defence of India, the relations of India with foreign powers, security of India, security of a State, maintenance of public order, or the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community [ Ss. 3(1) and 3(2)]. These are all the grounds mentioned in the two legislative entries in Lists I and III.44 A district magistrate can make such an order on the last three grounds, viz., the grounds which fall within List III, if authorised to do so by the State Government. As a safeguard against misuse of power by a district magistrate, he is required forthwith to communicate to the State Government concerned the fact of his making the order along with necessary particulars, and an order made by him cannot remain in force for more than 12 days unless approved by the State Government in the meantime [ s. 3(4)]. A State Government making or approving the order has to report the fact to the Central Government within seven days along with the necessary particulars [ s. 3(5)]. It is the Central Government's duty to consider the report. This is a statutory obligation of the Central Government.45 This is to enable the Central Government to keep some control over the State Governments in this area. Provisions have been made for communication of grounds to the detenu ordinarily not later than five days and, in exceptional circumstances, and for reasons to be recorded in writing, within 10 days of his arrest,46 Page 1328 and for giving him the earliest opportunity to make a representation against his detention to the government concerned as envisaged by Art. 22(5) [ s. 8(1)]. The authority is not required to disclose facts which it considers to be against the public interest to disclose [ s. 8(2)].47 This provision is in accordance with Art. 22(6) mentioned above. Provisions have been made in the Act for constituting advisory boards in terms of Art. 22(4). A board is to consist of three persons qualified to act as the High Court Judges, and one of the members, who is or has been a High Court Judge, is to act as its chairman [ s. 9]. The government is to place before the board within 21 days of the date of detention, the grounds of detention, detenu's representation and the report of the detaining officer [ s. 10]. The board is to submit its report within seven weeks of the date of detention [ s. 11(1)]. The board can call for such further information as it may deem necessary from the government or the detenu or any other person [ s. 11(1)]. The board can hear the detenu personally if it considers it essential, or if the detenu desires to be heard [ s. 11(1)]. The detenu cannot appear before the board through a legal practitioner [ s. 11(4)]. The board is to specify whether or not in its opinion there is sufficient cause for the detention of the person concerned [ s. 11(2)]. If the board reports in favour of detention, the government may confirm the detention order and continue his detention for such period as it thinks fit [ s. 12(1)]. In case the board reports unfavourably, the order of detention is to be revoked and the person released forthwith [ s. 12(2)]. The government concerned has power to revoke the order at any time, [ s. 14], or to release a detenu on parole conditionally or unconditionally [ s. 15]. In case of revocation, a fresh detention order can be made against the same person [ s. 14(2)]. The maximum period for which a person can be detained under the Act is twelve months [ s. 13]. The constitutional validity of NSA came to be considered by the Supreme Court in A.K. Roy v. Union of India .48 The Court rejected the contention that preventive detention was basically impermissible under the Indian Constitution. The main argument against the validity of NSA was formulated as follows: Under S.",

    "content": "main argument against the validity of NSA was formulated as follows: Under S. 3 of the Act, an order of preventive detention can be made if the Government is satisfied that it is necessary to do so to prevent a person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the defence of India, the relations of India with foreign powers, security of India, security of the State, maintenance of public order, or maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community. The vagueness of these expressions confers \"uncontrolled discretion\" on the detaining authority to expand the horizon of the power to detain, to the detriment of the liberty of the subject. The various phrases occurring in S. 3 such as 'defence of India', etc., are so vague, general and elastic that even conduct otherwise lawful can be comprehended therein depending upon the \"whim and caprice\" of the detaining authority. These expressions have been picked up from the relevant legislative entries in the Constitution without any attempt being made at making them precise or definite. Accepting the proposition that the vagueness and the consequent uncertainty of a preventive detention law bears upon its reasonableness, for a person \"cannot be deprived of his liberty by a law which is nebulous and uncertain in its definition and application,\"49 the Supreme Court, nevertheless, refused to hold the NSA invalid on this ground. According to the Court, the various expressions used in the Act relate to concepts \"which are difficult to encase within the strait-jacket of a definition\", \"are not of any great certainty or definiteness,\" and are not capable of a precise definition, but they \"do not elude a just application to practical situations.\"50S. 3 cannot, therefore, be struck down for vagueness and uncertainty. The Court explained itself thus:51 \"...there are expressions which inherently comprehend such an infinite variety of situations that definitions, instead of lending to them a definite meaning, can only succeed either in robbing them to their intended amplitude or in making it necessary to frame further definitions of the terms defined.\" However, the Court did issue a caution: since these concepts are not defined, the Courts must strive to give them a \"narrower construction than what the literal words suggest\". The National Security Act must be restricted in its application to as few situations as possible and it is on this \"unstated premise\" that the Page 1329 constitutionality ofS. 3 may be upheld which contains clauses \"which are fraught with grave consequences to personal liberty, if construed liberally\". The Court did however find the expression concerning 'maintenance of supplies' to be vague. It does not make clear as to which 'supplies' or 'services' are regarded essential to the community. In the absence of a definition of 'supplies and services essential to the community', the detaining authority can extend the application of this clause to any commodities or services which it regards essential to the community. The particular clause is not only vague and uncertain but is capable of being extended cavalierly to supplies, the maintenance of which may not be essential to the community. The clause \"is, therefore, capable of wanton abuse in that the detaining authority can place under detention any person for possession of any commodity on the basis that the authority is of the opinion that the maintenance of supply of that commodity is essential to the community\". \"To allow the personal liberty of the people to be taken away by the application of that clause would be a flagrant violation of the fairness and justness of procedure which is implicit in the provisions of Art. 21.\" The Court thought that the legislature could easily define which supplies and services are essential to the community. The Court however did not strike down the clause for \"it is vitally necessary to ensure as steady flow of supplies and services which are essential to the community,\" but, instead, ruled that no person should be detained under that clause unless, \"by a law, order or notification made or published fairly in advance, the supplies and services, the maintenance of which is regarded as essential to the community and in respect of which the order of detention is proposed to be passed, are made known appropriately, to the public\".52 The NSA confers power to detain persons on the district magistrate, or the commissioner of police, when authorised by the State Government to do so. This was challenged as wholly unreasonable, but the Court refused the challenge in Roy arguing as follows: (i) the law contains a number of safeguards subject to which only these officers can exercise the said power; (ii) the State Government can confer such a power on these officers only if the government is satisfied that having regard to the circumstances prevailing or likely to prevail in any area, it is necessary to empower these officers to take action; (iii) the power is given for a limited period specified in the order of the State Government--authority being given for three months at a time; (iv) they can pass orders only on three grounds, viz., security of State, public order, essential supplies and services; (v) the officer has to report forthwith the fact of detention to the State Government; and (vi) no such order of detention can remain in force for more than 12 days unless approved by the government. In view of these inbuilt safeguards, according to the Court, the power conferred on the district magistrate or the commissioner of police to pass orders of preventive detention cannot be said to be excessive or unreasonable. (b) COFEPOSA ACT Besides NSA, Parliament has also enacted the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974, (COFEPOSA). This Act provides for preventive detention with a view to prevent smuggling and to prevent any one from acting in a manner prejudicial to conserving and augmenting foreign exchange.",

This Act provides for preventive detention with a view to prevent smuggling and to prevent any one from acting in a manner prejudicial to conserving and augmenting foreign exchange. The Act contemplates two situations for making orders of preventive detention (a) to prevent violation of foreign exchange regulations; and (b) to prevent smuggling activities If any of the above situations exist in the opinion of the concerned authority, he can pass an order of preventive detention. It is not necessary to detain a person that he be involved in a criminal offence. Preventive detention and prosecution for an offence are entirely different concepts.53 The Act was enacted as violations of foreign exchange regulations and smuggling activities were having an increasingly deleterious effect on the national economy and thereby a serious adverse effect on the security of state. The Act became necessary because ordinary laws did not prove effective enough to curb smuggling of goods into India. The Act derives its validity from entry 36, List I,54 read with the residuary powers of Page 1330 Parliament.55 Most of its provisions are similar to NSA. The Act fulfils all the requirements of Art. 22 as mentioned above. The power to detain is to be exercised on being satisfied with respect to any person that with a view to preventing him from including in any prejudicial activity specified in S. 3, it is necessary to make an order for his detention. Under this Act, as laid down in S. 3(1), and order of detention can be passed by--(i) Central Government; (ii) an officer of the Central Government, not below a joint secretary, especially empowered for the purpose; (iii) State Government; or (iv) an officer of the State Government not below the rank of Secretary, especially empowered for the purpose. The Supreme Court has ruled in Sushila,56 that even when an order is passed by a especially empowered officer, the order is still to be regarded as the order of the Central/State Government, as the case may be. The detenu has a right to make his representation against his detention to the appropriate government and not to the empowered officer who actually made the order of detention. COFEPOSA Act has been held to be constitutionally valid as it is relatable to Entry 3, List III, as the Act provides for preventive detention for reasons connected with the security of state as well as the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community. In Attorney General for India v. Amratlal Prajivandas, 57 the Supreme Courthas defined the term \"security of state\" used in Entry 3, List III, very broadly. The security of state is affected by its weak and vulnerable economy. A state with weak economy falls an easy prey to economic colonisers. \"In the modern world, the security of a state\" is ensured not so much by physical might but by economic strength--at any rate, by economic strength as much as by armed might\". Thus, COFEPOSA Act is related to \"security of state\".58 Violations of foreign exchange regulations and smuggling activities have a deleterious effect on the national economy thereby casting serious adverse effect on the security of state. In any case, COFEPOSA Act can be justified under Parliament's residuary power under Art. 248 read with entry 97, List I.59As the Act does not fall under any entry in List II, it is not necessary for the court to enquire to which Entry or Entries does the Act relate. It must be held that the Parliament did have the competence to enact the Act.60 Under the COFEPOSA Act, an order of detention can be made either by the State or the Central Government. Under S. 11(b), the Central Government may, at any time, revoke or modify any order made by the State Government. When an order is made by the State Government, it is the detaining authority under Art. 22(5) and the detenu can make a representation to the State Government against his detention.61 But the detenu can also make a representation to the Central Government, although it is not the detaining authority under Art. 22(5), after his representation to the State Government, which is the detaining authority, has been rejected. The Supreme Court has ruled that though the Central Government, strictly speaking, is not the detaining authority within the meaning of Art. 22(5), the power of the Central Government to revoke the order implies that the detenu can make a representation to the Central Government to exercise its power to revoke the order. The Central Government has to consider the representation with reasonable expedition. If there is undue delay on the part of the Central Government in considering the representation and if there is no satisfactory explanation for such delay, the detention order may be quashed. This power of the Central Government is thus an additional safeguard to the detenu against the improper exercise of its power of detention by the detaining authority.62 (c) PBMSECA In addition to the above mentioned two statutes, Parliament has also enacted the Prevention of Blackmarketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, 1980 (PBMSECA). TheAct authorises the Central or State Government to make an order detaining a person with a view to prevent him from committing black marketing and from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies of commodities essential to the community. The Act contains the usual provisions for communicating grounds of detention to the detenu, his making of a representation, reference of the case to an advisory board, etc. These provisions are mostly similar to NSA and in conformity with Art. 22, as mentioned above. Page 1331 To co-ordinate the scope of this Act with the National Security Act, the expression used in the NSA,viz., \"maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community\" is not to include the expression used in the Blackmarketing Act, viz.",

    "content": "of supplies of commodities essential to the community.\" Accordingly, no order of detention is to be made under the NSA on any ground on which an order of detention may be made under the PBMSECA.63The expression used in this Actmainly means committing or instigating any person to commit an offence punishable under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, or under any other law relating to the control of the production, supply or distribution of, or trade and commerce in any commodity essential to the community, or dealing in an essential commodity with a view to making gain in a manner defeating the statutory provisions.64 (ii) State Laws Besides the Central Acts mentioned above, there are several State statutes authorising preventive detention for various purposes, e.g., The Tamil Nadu Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers, Drug Offenders, Forest Offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders and Slum Grabbers Act, 1982; The Gujarat Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act, 1985; The Bihar Control of Crimes Act, 1981; The Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Slumlords, Bootleggers, Drug Offenders And Dangerous Persons Act, 1981; The Andhra Pradesh Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers, Dacoits, Drug Offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders and Land Grabbers Act, 1986. D. JUDICIAL REVIEW OF ORDERS OF PREVENTIVE DETENTION The area of preventive detention is very much administrative-ridden. The law of preventive detention has been so designed as to leave a very broad discretion with administrative authorities to order preventive detention of a person, and leave only a narrow margin for judicial review. However, the courts have been conscious of the fact that preventive detention affects one of the most cherished rights of a human being, namely, the freedom of his person and have, therefore, gradually evolved a few principles to control administrative discretion in the area in order to safeguard the individual's freedom from undue exercise of power. The Courts have achieved this by construing the relevant provisions of Art. 22 liberally, by insisting that the provisions of the specific law under which an order of preventive detention is made should be observed scrupulously, and by applying vigorously and creatively some of the principles of administrative law controlling administrative discretion. The Supreme Court has itself defined its role, when the liberty of a person is involved under a law of preventive detention, as follows: \"It is the bounden duty of the court to satisfy itself that all the safeguards provided by the law have been scrupulously observed and that the subject is not deprived of his personal liberty otherwise than in accordance with law.\" The Courts have adopted not a mechanical view of their role but a purposeful approach to draw a fine balance between individual freedom and social control. The Courts have thus endeavored to soften the rigours of the law somewhat. The law of preventive detention has been a very contentious measure and has given rise to a catena of cases and it will not be an exaggeration to say that by now a distinct jurisprudence of preventive detention has been evolved in the country. The Supreme Court's interpretation of Art. 22 has already been discussed earlier in this Chapter. Some of the other judicially established propositions concerning preventive detention are noted below.65 On the whole, the Supreme Court has played a very creative role in this area as its constant endeavour has been to create by judicial interpretation of the relevant provisions as many safeguards--procedural as well as substantive--as possible, and, thus, somewhat to mitigate the harshness of the law. An order of preventive detention to be valid has to conform with the requirements laid down in Art. 22 as well as those laid down in the specific statute under which the order has been made. The Supreme Court has always placed the Page 1332 burden of showing that the detention is in accordance with the procedure established by law on the detaining authority because of Art. 21.66 On this points, the Supreme Court has observed in Icchu Devi v. Union of India :67 \"This constitutional right of life and personal liberty is placed on such a high pedestal by this Court that it has always insisted that whenever there is any deprivation of life or personal liberty, the authority responsible for such deprivation must satisfy the Court that it has acted in accordance with the law. This is an area where the Court has been most strict and scrupulous in ensuring with the requirements of the law... The Court has always regarded personal liberty as the most precious possession of mankind and refused to tolerate illegal detention, regardless of the social cost involved...\" The Supreme Court has emphasized from time to time that personal liberty is one of the most cherished values of mankind; without it, life will not be worth living and, it is, therefore, necessary that the courts always lean in favour of upholding personal liberty. The power of preventing detention is an extraordinary power which can be exercised strictly in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and the law. As preventive detention encroaches upon personal liberty, it is the solemn duty of the courts to ensure that this power is exercised strictly in accordance with the requirements of the Constitution and the law. Even a slight deviation from the law may result in the order of preventive detention being quashed. If there is a breach of any legal provision, the rule of law requires that the detenu must be set at liberty, howsoever wicked or mischievous he may be. Thus, continued detention of a detenu becomes illegal because of non-compliance with statutory and constitutional requirements. The Court has emphasized from time to time that the power of preventive detention being a \"draconian\" power, it is tolerated in a free society, as a \"necessary evil\".",

    "content": "Supreme Court has emphasized recently in V.C. Mohan v. Union of India :68 \"The accepted methodology of governmental working should always be intune with the concept of fairness and not de hors the same--a person is being placed under detention without trial and there is neither any scope for overzealous nor acting in a manner without due and proper application of mind--in either situation law courts should be able to protect the individual from the administrative ipse dixit.\" The Supreme Court has ruled in Sunil Fulchand Shah v. Union of India, 69 that when the High Court quashes an order of detention resulting in the release of the detenu, but, on appeal, the High Court decision is reversed, the question whether or not the detenu ought to be made to surrender to undergo the remaining period of detention depends upon many factors and, in particular, on the question of lapse of time between the date of detention, the order of the High Court setting aside the order of detention, and the order of the Supreme Court setting aside the High Court order. (a) NO OBJECTIVE STANDARD NECESSARY A law of preventive detention is not invalid because it prescribes no objective standard for ordering preventive detention, and leaves the matter to the subjective satisfaction of the executive. The reason for this view is that preventive detention is not punitive but preventive and is resorted to with a view to prevent a person from committing activities regarded as prejudicial to certain objects which the law of preventive detention seeks to prescribe. Preventive detention is thus based on suspicion or anticipation and not on proof. It is, therefore, not possible to lay down objective rules of conduct non-observance of which should lead to preventive detention. The responsibility for security of state, or maintenance of public order, or essential services and supplies rests on the executive and it must, therefore, have the necessary power to order preventive detention. The subjective satisfaction of a detaining authority to detain a person or not is not open to objective assessment by a Court. A Court is not a proper forum to scrutinise the merits of the administrative decision to detain a person. The Court cannot substitute its own satisfaction for that of the authority concerned and decide whether its satisfaction was reasonable or proper, or whether in the circumstances of the matter, the person concerned should have been detained or not.70 The Supreme Court has stated the position as Page 1333 follows: \"When power is given to an authority to act on certain facts and if that authority acts on relevant facts and arrives at a decision which cannot be described as either irrational or unreasonable; in the sense that no person instructed in law could have reasonably taken that view, then the order is not bad and the court cannot substitute its decision or opinion, in place of the decision of the authority concerned on the necessity of passing the order\".71 The Courts do not even go into the question whether the facts mentioned in the grounds of detention are correct or false. The reason for the rule is that to decide this, evidence may have to be taken by the Courts and that is not the policy of the law of preventive detention. This matter lies within the competence of the advisory board.72 The Court has pointed out that as far as the factor of releasing on bail is concerned, the only requirement is that the Detaining Authority should be aware that the detenu is already in custody and is likely to be released to bail and if there were materials before the authority to come to the conclusion that there was likelihood of the detenu being released on bail the court will not interfere with such subjective satisfaction of the authority.73 Although even a solitary instance may be the basis of a subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority, its precedence and nature of activities carried out are required to be taken into consideration for reaching a justifiable satisfaction that the person was engaged in smuggling and that with a view to prevent it, it was necessary to detain him.74 (b) CIRCUMSTANCES VITIATING SUBJECTIVE SATISFACTION Whatever has been said above, however, does not mean that the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority is completely unreviewable. There are a number of principles of Administrative Law which the courts frequently invoke to control the discretion of the detaining authority to some extent. Thus, satisfaction of the detaining authority can be called in question inter alia on such grounds as mala fides, non-application of the authority's mind to the case of the detenu,75 subjective satisfaction being based on irrelevant grounds, etc. The satisfaction of the detaining authority must be grounded on materials of rationally probative value and it should not be arrived at without taking into account relevant factors. Discretion should not be arbitrary, vague, fanciful but should be legal and regular. If the detaining authority comes to a conclusion so unreasonably that no reasonable person could have ever come to it, the court can interfere.76 A detention order can be quashed if any relevant material is not placed before the detaining authority.77 As the Supreme Court has observed in this connection : \"The satisfaction of the detaining authority is not a subjective one based on the detaining authority's emotions, beliefs or prejudices. There must be a real likelihood of the person being able to indulge in such activities, the inference of such likelihood being drawn from objective data.\"78 The Court does not, of course, go into the 'adequacy or sufficiency' of the grounds on which the order of detention is based but merely examines whether, on the grounds given to the detenu, a reasonable person could possibly have come to the conclusion to which the detaining authority did.",

    "content": "the dividing line between subjective satisfaction and objective determination becomes rather blurred, but the line is still there howsoever faint it may be.79 (c) NON-CONSIDERATION OF A MATERIAL FACT Formation of subjective satisfaction on the part of the detaining authority may be vitiated if a material or vital fact which may have a bearing on the issue and may influence the mind of the detaining authority one way or other is not considered by the detaining authority before issuing the detention order.80 The Supreme Court has laid down the following proposition in Asha Devi:81 \"... If material or vital facts which would influence the minds of the detaining authority one way or the other on the question whether or not to make the detention order, are not placed before or are not considered by the detaining authority it would vitiate its subjective satisfaction rendering the detention order illegal\". Page 1334 In the instant case, one such fact may be that the person against whom a detention order is proposed to be issued is being prosecuted for an offence. The fact that a criminal case is pending against the person against whom an order of preventive detention is going to be issued is a very material circumstance which ought to be placed before the detaining authority. This circumstance might quite possibly have an impact on his decision whether or not to make an order of detention. It is not altogether unlikely that the authority may take the view that since a criminal case is pending against the person sought to be detained, no detention order need be made for the present, but the criminal case should be allowed to run its full course, and only if it fails to end in conviction, then preventive detention should be resorted to.82 Similarly, if any enquiry into allegations of criminal activity is inconclusive and pending consideration, the same cannot be the basis for passing an order against the person concerned.83 (d) NON-APPLICATION OF MIND An order of preventive detention can be quashed if the authority passes it mechanically and without applying its mind.84 The liberty of a person is a serious matter and it cannot be trifled with in a casual, indifferent and routine manner. At times, some formal defect in the order of the preventive detention may be regarded by the Court as indicating non-application of mind by the authority making the order. NSA authorises preventive detention on several grounds. The order of detention, should, therefore, specify the ground or grounds on which detention has been ordered. An order will be bad if it says that the detention has been ordered on ground (a) or ground (b). Thus, an order saying that the petitioner was being detained with a view to preventing him from acting in a manner 'prejudicial to the maintenance of the public order' or 'security of state', was bad. 'Public order' and 'security of state' are two separate grounds of detention under NSA. If the prejudicial activities of the petitioner affected both these grounds, then the order should have used the conjunctive 'and' instead of the disjunctive 'or'. The use of the word 'or' indicates that the detaining authority was either not certain of, or did not apply its mind to, whether the petitioner's activities fell under one head or the other and merely reproduced mechanically the statutory formula.85 The Home Department of Bengal Government followed the practice of issuing a detention order automatically whenever the police recommended it, and the Home Secretary did not personally satisfy himself on the materials placed before him whether it was necessary to issue such an order in a particular case or not. A detention order issued in such a routine manner was quashed by the Privy Council in Emperor v. Sibnath Banerji86 on the ground that the Home Secretary had not applied his mind to the question of issuing the order and that his personal satisfaction in each case of detention was a condition precedent to the issue of such an order. In a detention order, the grounds of detention were a verbatim reproduction of the allegation made against the detenu in a police dossier submitted to the detaining authority who was not even aware that the detenu was in custody at the time the order was issued. Quashing the order, the Supreme Court observed: \"We are afraid it is difficult to find greater proof of non-application of mind.\"87 Glaring factual errors in the grounds served on a detenu may lead to the inference that the order was issued without proper application of mind by the detaining authority.88 An order passed by a district magistrate on the direction of a senior officer, but without having any grounds on record against the concerned person is void. The magistrate can pass an order when he is himself personally satisfied on the materials before him. He ought not to pass an order mechanically or under any body else's dictates.89 (e) MALA FIDES The Courts quash an order of detention if mala fides of the detaining authority are established. A kerosene dealer was detained. He alleged in the Court that the Deputy Superintendent of Police, at whose Page 1335 instance the order was issued, had made false reports against him so that he could be eliminated as a wholesale kerosene dealer and D.S.P.'s relatives might be benefited by obtaining the distributorship for kerosene. On the basis of the affidavits filed, the Supreme Court found some substance in these allegations and ruled that the detention order was 'clearly and plainly mala fide'.90 Will a detention order be regarded as mala fide and hence invalid because it is made against a person on the very same grounds on which he had been earlier prosecuted in a Court but dischargd?",

    "content": "can plausibly be argued that preventive detention in such a situation circumvents the ordinary law of the land and defeats the Court's order and what better proof of the detaining authority's mala fides could there be than its use of its extrarodinary powers of preventive detention when a person had been acquitted or discharged by a court. However, generally speaking, the mere fact that criminal proceedings had been initiated against a person for certain incidents and that he was discharged by the Court would neitherbar a valid detention order being passed against him on the basis of these very incidents nor can such an order for that reason be characterised as mala fide. The rationale of this judicial view is that while the purpose of trial and punishment is punitive and it seeks to punish for past offences and, therefore, needs proof beyond reasonable doubt, the purpose of preventive detention is 'preventive'. It is a precautionary measure and is based on a reasonable prognosis of the future behaviour of a person based on his past conduct in the light of surrounding circumstances. Therefore, while there may not be evidence sufficient to prove him guilty in a court, it may be sufficient to sustain the subjective satisfaction to order detention.91 Many a time, the prosecution fails because witnesses are afraid to depose against desperate characters, but detaining authorities may be satisfied on the basis of the past activities of the person concerned that it was necessary to detain him to prevent him from committing prejudicial activities.92 Nor can a detention order be held bad on the ground that it is based on such grounds as could be tried under the criminal law, and that the accused should have been so tried instead of being detained.93 What, however, has been said above is not a universal rule, and there may be extreme cases and exceptional circumstances when a prior court case, or lack of it, may be a factor in invalidating detention. The Courts have been conscious of the danger that the executive may tend to shy away from Court proceedings for bringing home to the person concerned his guilt in the normal manner, and, instead, adopt the easier strategy of issuing preventive detention orders based on their subjective satisfaction. Such a tendency, if allowed unchecked, may pose a danger to the democratic way of life. Referring to this aspect of the matter, the Supreme Court observed in Bhut Nath v. State of West Bengal .1\"...detention power cannot be quietly used to subvert, supplant or to substitute the punitive law of the Penal Code. The immune expedient of throwing into a prison cell one whom ordinary law would take care of, merely because it is irksome to undertake the inconvenience of proving guilt in Court is unfair abuse.\" In a case, the facts may so clearly indicate that an ordinary criminal prosecution would suffice and the need to make preventive detention order might not be reasonably made out.2 The Supreme Court has thus been cautious in this area, and has read some qualifications in the rules abovementioned. In Vijay Narain Singh,3 the Supreme Court has stated that the law of preventive detention being a drastic law it must be strictly construed and should not ordinarily be used for clipping the wings of an accused if criminal prosecution would suffice. Again, in Ramesh Yadav,4 the Supreme Court has stated that ordinarily a detention order should not be passed merely on the ground that the detenu who was carrying on smuggling activities was likely to be enlarged on bail. In such a case, the proper course would be to oppose the bail application. If it is granted then the decision ought to be challenged in the higher forum but it should not be circumvented by passing an order of detention merely to supersede the bail order. The same principle has been reiterated by the Supreme Court in Suraj Pal Sahu.5 A preventive detention order served on a person on the self-same grounds on which he was being prosecuted was declared invalid in Biram Chand v. Uttar Pradesh6 on the ground that--(i) two parallel proceedings--prosecution as well as detention--should not be takensimultaneously against a person; (ii) a Page 1336 person faced with a criminal charge and prosecution, has no proper and reasonable opportunity to make an effective representation against his detention; (iii) the fact that a criminal prosecution is pending against a person is not a relevant ground for making a detention order. This was impeccable logic, but in Haradhan Saha v. State of West Bengal, 7 the Supreme Court dissented with this view and held that a detention order passed during the pendency of the prosecution would not be invalid. In Srilal Shaw v. State of West Bengal, 8 a preventive order was issued against a person mainly on the ground that he had stolen railway property. He had documents to show that he had purchased the goods in question in the open market. A criminal case filed against him was dropped and detention order passed instead. A three Judge Bench of the Supreme Court declared the order bad. The Court thought that it was a typical case where for no apparent reason a person who could easily be prosecuted under the punitive law was being preventively detained. The Court noted that Parliament had enacted a special law which conferred extensive powers on the executive to bring to book persons found in unlawful possession of railway property. If the facts stated were true then it was an easy case to take to the successful conclusion. The Court felt that the criminal case against the detenu was probably dropped because he might have been able to prove his innocence.",

    "content": "Court felt that the criminal case against the detenu was probably dropped because he might have been able to prove his innocence. The Court, therefore, held that, on the basis of the material available to the detaining authority, 'it was impossible to arrive at the conclusion that the possession of the petitioner was unlawful'.9 The Court adopted the Shaw ruling instead of the Saha ruling in L.K. Das v. State of West Bengal10 and held a detention order bad as being based on a 'simple, solitary incident of theft' without anything more. The government's contention that the prosecution could not be pursued in the case as the witnesses were afraid to give evidence against the person concerned was rejected by the Court as being 'fanciful', repugnant to reason and reality and one, which could not be swallowed even by an ultra-credulous man, because all the witnesses were members of the railway force. In Noor Chand v. State of West Bengal, 11 the Supreme Court emphasized that the fact that the petitioner was discharged from the criminal cases was not entirely irrelevant and it was a circumstance which the detaining authority could not altogether disregard. In this case, the petitioner had been discharged in a criminal trial but then detained. He claimed that he had been discharged because there was no material against him and not because witnesses were afraid to give evidence. The witnesses in the case were members of the railway protection force and there was no question of these people being afraid to give evidence. The magistrate detaining the person did not file an affidavit controverting the suggestion made by the detenu. The Court found it an infirmity that the detaining authority did not assert that in spite of the discharge he was satisfied, on some valid material, about the petitioner's complicity in the criminal acts which constitute the basis of the 'detention order'. The Court declared that the order was a 'colourable exercise of power'. The Court felt convinced that there was no material on the basis of which the detaining authority could have been satisfied to detain the person concerned.12 The Court has thus adopted the attitude that although the subjective satisfaction of the authority is not to be tested by 'objective' standards, nevertheless, a 'sham satisfaction is no satisfaction.' The upshot of all this is that, while discharge in a criminal case by itself is not sufficient to vitiate detention later, there may be circumstances which coupled with non-prosecution in a court, or failure of prosecution, may make detention bad. The Courts do not take at its face value the assertion by the government that witnesses were afraid to testify against the detenu and hence the prosecution could not be undertaken or that it failed. Similarly, detention will be vitiated if the court had earlier declared the case to be false or baseless and the detenu was detained on the same grounds as had formed the subject-matter of the unsuccessful prosecution.13 This cautious approach of the Courts reflects its anxiety that preventive detention should not be used to supplant the ordinary judicial machinery which may become a threat to democratic values. If the Court feels satisfied that the prosecution was not undertaken, or that it failed not because the witnesses were afraid to testify but because there was no material against the detenu, then it can hold that the satisfaction of the detaining authority was 'colourable' as there was no rational basis for its satisfaction.14 Another problem which has arisen is : can an order of preventive detention be served on a person who is already in custody for some criminal charges.? As an abstract proposition of law, it can be said that the Page 1337 authority is not precluded to pass such an order, but the question may arise in a specific fact situation whether such an order was justified. For example, if a person is already sentenced to ten years' rigorous imprisonment, it is not possible to argue that an order of preventive detention may be served on him, soon after the sentence is pronounced, directing his detention after his release from the prison after the period of sentence is over. On the other hand, if a person is undergoing imprisonment for a month or so, the authority may serve a detention order to be effective after his release. If the authority is bona fide satisfied that his detention is necessary, he can make a valid detention order a few days before his release from prison. The antecedent history and the past conduct on which the order of detention would be based would, in such a case, be proximate in point of time and would have a rational connection with the conclusion drawn by the authority that the detention of the person after his release is necessary. Therefore, the question whether an order of detention can be passed against a person who is in jail, has to be determined in the circumstances of each case.15 (a) In the following cases, preventive detention orders served on persons in jail have been held valid. In Kartic Chandra Guha v. State of West Bengal, 16 [e4] the order was held valid as there was a likelihood of the detenu being released on bail and resuming his prejudicial activities. In Dr. Ramakrishna Rawat v. District Magistrate, Jabalpur, 17 the order of detention was passed as the detenu was in jail custody for a short duration. On the basis of his antecedent activities, the detaining authority could reasonably reach his subjective satisfaction that the detenu would act in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.18 (b) In the following cases, the orders of preventive detention served on persons in jail have been quashed. In Shashi19, the order was quashed as there was no material or record that the detenu, if released on bail, was likely to commit activities prejudicial to maintenance of public order. In Meera Rani,20 the order of preventive detention was quashed.",

The Court laid down the applicable principle in these cases in the following words: \"Subsisting custody of the detenu by itself does not invalidate an order of his preventive detention and the decision must depend on the facts of the particular case; preventive detention being necessary to prevent the detenu from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of the state or to the maintenance of public order etc., ordinarily it is not needed when the detenu is already in custody; the detaining authority must show its awareness to the fact of subsisting custody of the detenu and take that factor into account while making the order; but, even so, if the detaining authority is reasonably satisfied on cogent material that there is likelihood of his release and in view of his antecedent activities which are proximate in point of time he must be detained in order to prevent him from indulging in such prejudicial activities, the detention order can be validly made even in anticipation to operate on his release\". The Supreme Court has held in Binod Singh21 that if a person is in custody and there is no imminent possibility of his being released therefrom, the power of the detention should not ordinarily be exercised. Before passing a detention order in respect of a person who is already in jail, the concerned authority must satisfy itself, and that satisfaction must be reached on the basis of cogent material, that there is a real possibility of the detenu being released on bail, and that if released on bail, the material on record reveals that he will indulge in prejudicial activity if not detained. In Poonam Lata v. M.L. Wadhwan, 22 the Supreme Court has explained the position thus: the fact that the detenu is already in detention does not take away the jurisdiction of the detaining authority in making an order of preventive detention. What is necessary in such a case is to satisfy the court when detention is challenged on that ground that the detaining authority was aware of the fact that the detenu was already in custody and yet he was subjectively satisfied that the order of detention was necessary. In the instant case, there was sufficient material to show that the detaining authority was aware that the petitioner was in custody when the order was made, yet he was satisfied that his preventive detention was necessary. Page 1338 In Abdul Razak Sheikh,23 the detention order was quashed on the ground of non-application of mind as it was found that the detaining authority was unaware that the detenu's application for bail was rejected by the concerned Court.24 In Sanjeev Kumar Aggarwal v. Union of India, 25 a detention order was served on the detenu who was already in jail as it was apprehended that he would indulge in prejudicial activities on being released on bail. Upholding the order, the Supreme Court ruled that there was no law to say that no detention order could validly be passed against a person in custody under any circumstances. The facts and circumstances of each case have to be taken into consideration to consider the validity of a detention order passed when the detenu is in jail. In the instant case, the Court felt satisfied that the order could not be quashed because of the following circumstances: the order was passed under COFEPOSA; the detaining authority was aware that the detenu was in jail; the detaining authority felt satisfied that the detenu was likely to come out on bail and, thereafter, would again indulge in smuggling. In Kamarunissa v. Union of India, 26 the Supreme Court has recently derived the following propositions from the catena of decisions on preventive detention: even in case of a person in custody a detention order can validly be passed-- (1) if the authority passing the order is aware of the fact that he is actually in custody; (2) if he has reason to believe on the basis of reliable material placed before him (a) that there is a real possibility of his being released on bail, and (b) that on being so released he would in all probability indulge in prejudicial activity; and (3) if it is felt essential to detain him to prevent him from doing so. If the authority passes an order after recording his satisfaction in this behalf, such an order cannot be struck down on the ground that the proper course for the authority would be to oppose the bail and if bail was granted notwithstanding such opposition to question it before a higher court. The Supreme Court has observed in this connection: \"It seems to us well-settled that even in a case where a person is in custody, if the facts and circumstances of the case so demand, resort can be had to the law of preventive detention.\" (f) COLOURABLE EXERCISE OF POWER A detention order may be quashed on the ground of colourable exercise of power if there is no rational material for the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority, or that the material is such that no reasonable person could possibly arrive at such satisfaction on its basis.27 A considerable delay, say of two or three months, between the date of making the detention order and the arrest of the person concerned thereunder has been held to throw doubt on the genuineness of the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority.",

    "content": "if the authority was genuinely satisfied that it was necessary to detain the person concerned so as to prevent him from committing prejudicial activities, then the authority should act promptly to arrest him after making the order and not let him remain at large to carry on his objectionable activities. Therefore, if the authority fails to furnish a reasonable explanation for the delay, the subjective satisfaction may be inferred to be 'colourable' and not genuine.28 It is, however, not the law that whenever there is some delay in arresting, the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority must be held to be not genuine or colourable. Each case must depend on its own peculiar facts and circumstances. There must be \"live and proximate link\" between the grounds of detention and the avowed purpose of detention, and in some cases it is possible to assume that this link is snapped if there is a long and unexplained delay between the date of the order of detention and the arrest of the detenu.29 In Abdul Rahman,30 the detention order was passed on 7-10-87 under COFEPOSA but the detenu was arrested on 18-1-88. The detention was quashed as there was no satisfactory explanation for the delay in arresting the detenu in pursuance of the detention order. The Court observed:31 Page 1339 \"...When there is unsatisfactory and unexplained delay between the date of order of detention and the date of securing the arrest of detenu, such a delay would throw considerable doubt on the genuineness of the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority leading to a legitimate inference that the detaining authority was not really and genuinely satisfied as regards the necessity for detaining the detenu with a view to preventing him from acting in a prejudicial manner\". The Supreme Court has been vigilant to ensure that isolated offences are not made grounds for preventive detention because the executive may use this strategy to by-pass normal criminal judicial process. Thus, the Court has held that a solitary act of wagon breaking,32 or a simple solitary incident of theft without any thing more,33 can hardly persuade a reasonable man to reach the satisfaction that unless the person concerned was detained he would in all probability indulge in similar activities. But it may be otherwise in cases of crimes involving sophisticated technique and expertise, e.g., theft of railway signal material.34 There may be cases, like an organised and armed robbery where a single deviance may demonstrate potentiality for continuing criminality and thus sustain a detention order.35 The question in such cases is: Is the incident too flimsy or trivial to support the subjective satisfaction to detain the person concerned? Is the past activity of the detenu reasonably suggestive of a repetitive tendency on his part to likewise act in future? The Supreme Court has emphasized that the power of preventive detention is to be exercised only if the detaining authority, on the basis of the past prejudicial conduct of the detenu, is satisfied about the probability of his acting similarly in future.36 The Supreme Court has observed in Amratlal37: \"Though ordinarily one act may not be held sufficient to sustain an order of detention, one act may sustain an order of detention if the act is of such a nature as to indicate that it is an organised act or a manifestation of organized activity. The gravity and nature of the act is also relevant. The test is whether the act is such that it gives rise to an inference that the person would continue to indulge in similar prejudicial activity.\" A detention order on the basis of a single solitary instance of exporting Indian currency was held good under COFEPOSA.38 On the other hand, a detention order under the same Act based on a single incident was quashed by the Supreme Court in the case noted below.39From the facts \"it is totally unreasonable to arrive at a prognosis that the petitioner is likely to indulge in any such prejudicial activities.\" Similarly, in a recent case the court said that the mere fact that on one occasion a person smuggled goods into the country would not constitute a legitimate basis for detaining under the COFEPOSA Act.40 (g) NON-EXISTENT OR IRRELEVANT GROUND A detention order is bad if it is based on a non-existent ground.41 In the grounds served on a detenu, certain prejudicial activities were attributed to him on a day when he was in police custody. The order was quashed as having been based on a non-existent ground.42 A detention order should not be based on a ground which is irrelevant, or extraneous to, or falls outside, the scope and object of the law of preventive detention. The grounds on which a detention order has been made must have some rational connection with, and be relevant and germane to, the objects to prevent which the order in question has been made. A detention order based on no material but on pure speculation is not valid.43 Although the subjective satisfaction of the detaining officer is not open to objective assessment,44 nevertheless, satisfaction based on irrelevant ground is vitiated.45 The court may examine the 'grounds' specified in the order of detention to see whether they are relevant to the circumstances under which preventive detention can be supported. The test to determine the relevancy is this: are the grounds such as a rational human being can consider to be connected in some manner with the objects which are sought to be prevented?46 If the grounds relied on have nothing to do with the prejudicial purposes stipulated in the statute and the detention order, no nexus exists and the order is invalid. Even if the activities attributed to the detenu have some connection with the prohibited objectives, it should not be too trivial in substance. For instance, NSA authorises preventive detention for 'maintenance of public Page 1340 order'. 'Public order' has been judicially distinguished from 'law and order'. 'Public order\" and 'law and order' are two distinct concepts.",

    "content": "if the activities attributed to the detenu have some connection with the prohibited objectives, it should not be too trivial in substance. For instance, NSA authorises preventive detention for 'maintenance of public Page 1340 order'. 'Public order' has been judicially distinguished from 'law and order'. 'Public order\" and 'law and order' are two distinct concepts. Maintenance of 'public order' means prevention of disorder of a grave nature. An activity can be said to affect public order only if it affects the public at large.47 On the other hand, maintenance of 'law and order' means prevention of minor disorders or breaches of peace of a local nature which primarily injure specific individuals. An act affecting the current of community life is germane to 'public order'; an act affecting merely an individual leaving public tranquillity undisturbed is relevant to 'law and order' and not to 'public order'. One has to imagine three concentric circles, the largest representing \"law and order\", the next representing 'public order', and the smallest circle representing \"security of state'. An act may affect \"law and order\", but not 'public order'; an act may affect \"public order\" but not \"security of state\".48 As the Supreme Court has observed in Sushanta:49 \"The contravention of any law always affects order but before it can be said to affect public order it must affect the community or the public at large. A mere disturbance of law and order leading to disorder is not necessarily sufficient for action under the Act but a disturbance which will affect public order can alone justify the detention under that head.\" Again, the Supreme Court has observed in Gulab Mehra v. State of Uttar Pradesh :50 \"...whether an act relates to law and order or to public order depends upon the effect of the act on the life of the community or in other words the reach and effect and potentiality of the act if so put as to disturb or dislocate the even tempo of the life of the community, it will be an act which will affect public order.\" Sometimes, a simple 'law and order' situation may assume the gravity and mischief of a 'public order' problem by reason alone of the manner or circumstances in which, or the place at which, it is carried out. Necessarily, much depends upon the nature of the act, the place where it is committed and the sinister significance attached to it.51 In the final analysis, one has to turn to the facts of each case to ascertain whether the matter relates to the larger circle or the smaller circle. When an order of detention is questioned, it is for the court to decide whether the activities in question upon which the detention order is based go under the classification of public order or belong to the category of law and order. Thus, acts of theft or robbery,52 solitary cases of assault,53 or assault on a public servant,54 a murderous assault on a person causing him grievous injuries resulting in his death55 affect only 'law and order' and are not relevant to the concept of 'public order' and a preventive detention order based on any such ground cannot be sustained. Such acts do not in any way affect the even tempo of the community life nor do they affect the peace and tranquillity of the people in the particular locality where the crime is committed. The Supreme Court has ruled in Devaki56 that a single incident of murderous assault on a minister in a public place may give rise to a 'law and order' problem but certainly not to a 'public order' problem. \"This incident did not and could not affect public peace and tranquillity nor it had the potential to create a sense of alarm and insecurity in the locality\". The solitary incident as alleged in the ground of detention was held by the Court as \"not relevant' for sustaining the order of detention for the purpose of preventing the petitioner from acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. But highway robbery using daggers,57 murder by members of an extremist party with the object of promoting the party cause,58 possession of high explosive bombs,59 firing in public and killing people, affect public order. There may, however, be circumstances in which a criminal act against one person may amount to a problem of public order.60 A mere peaceful protest does not disturb public peace and, thus, has no nexus with 'public order'.61 In this area, Magan Gope62 is very instructive. Magan was detained on the ground inter aliathat, while engaged in the act of smuggling on a particular day, he along with his associates attacked a party of Home Guards at about 7 p.m. The Court quashed the order holding the matter to be relevant to 'law and order' and not to 'public order' because of the following reasons: there was absolutely no mention that any scare was caused within the locality as a result of the incident; it was not mentioned that the detenu and his associates were armed with any deadly weapons; the incident was confined to the detenu and his associates on the one Page 1341 hand and the Home Guards on the other. As a general proposition, the Court stated that prima facie there was no relation between smuggling from one State to another in the country which was essentially a secret operation and maintenance of public order in which the operative word is 'public'. There may, however, be cases of smuggling with violence affecting public tranquillity which may be related to 'public order'. The Supreme Court has now explained the concept of 'public order' in Amanulla Khan Pathan v. State of Gujarat .63 An activity violating an ordinary legal provision may in a given case amount to a matter of \"public order\".",

    "content": "is the magnitude of the activities and its effect on the even tempo of life of the society at large or with a section of the society that determines whether the activities can be said to be prejudicial to the maintenance of public order or not.\" In Mustakmiyan Jabbarmiya Shaikh v. M.M. Mehta, Commissioner of Police, 64 the Supreme Court has held that in order to bring the activities of a person within the expression \"acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order\", the fall out and the extent and reach of the alleged activities must be of such a nature that they travel beyond the capacity of the ordinary law to deal with him or to prevent his subversive activities affecting the community at large or a large section of the society. \"It is the degree of disturbance and its impact upon the even tempo of life of the society or the people of a locality which determines whether the disturbance caused by such activity amounts only to a breach of \"law and order\", or it amounts to breach of \"public order\".65 In Amanulla Khan, the activities of the detenu by way of trying to extract money from ordinary citizens by putting them to fear of death and on their refusal to part with the money to drag them and torture them on public road undoubtedly affected the even tempo of life of the society and, therefore, such activities cannot be said to be a mere disturbance of law and order. In the view of the Supreme Court, these activities were such that \"the detaining authority was satisfied that such activities amount to disturbance of public order and to prevent such disturbance the order of detention was passed\". Some of the activities held relevant to the 'maintenance of supplies and services' are: stealing of batteries from railway coaches;66 hoarding of stock of goods to sell in the black market;67 theft of telephone cable;68 smuggling of rice;69 black marketing;70 theft of electric copper wire disrupting electric supply.71 An undue time-lag between the offending activity and the order of detention based on it may vitiate the order on the basis that no authority, acting rationally, can be subjectively satisfied of future mischief merely because long ago the detenu had done something evil. The past conduct of a person can appropriately be taken into account in making a detention order, for it is largely from past tendencies of a person that an inference can be drawn whether he is likely to act in future in a prejudicial manner. But such an inference is justifiable only if the past conduct is proximate in point of time and has a rational connection with the conclusion that the detention of the person is necessary. If the time-lag between the prejudicial activity by a person and the detention order made because of that activity is ex facie long, the order would be invalid unless the detaining authority should explain to the court the delay in making the order to show that there was proximity between the prejudicial activity and the detention order.72 The credible chain between the grounds of criminal activity alleged by the detaining authority and the purpose of detention, is snapped if there is too long and unexplained an interval between the offending acts and the order of detention. But no mechanical test \"by counting the months of the interval\" could be laid down. It all depends on the facts of the case.73 As the Supreme Court has explained.74 \"Delay ipso facto in passing an order of detention is not fatal to the detention of a person, for in certain cases delay may be unavoidable and reasonable. What is required by law is that the delay must be satisfactorily examined by the detaining authority\". The position has been lucidly explained by the Supreme Court in Abdul Rahman:75 \"The question whether the prejudicial activities of a person necessitating to pass an order of extention is proximate to the time when the order is made or the live-link between the prejudicial activities and the purpose of detention is Page 1342 snapped depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. No hard and fast rule can be precisely formulated that would be applicable under all circumstances and no exhaustive guidelines can be laid down in that behalf. It follows that the test of proximity is not a rigid or mechanical test by merely counting number of months between the offending acts and the order of detention. However, when there is undue and long delay between the prejudicial activities and the passing of detention order, the court has to scrutinize whether the detaining authority has satisfactorily examined such a delay and afforded a tenable and reasonable explanation as to why such a delay has occasioned, when called upon to answer and further the Court has to investigate whether the causal connection has been broken in the circumstances of each case.\" If detention order is based on 'stale' or 'illusory' grounds, or if there is no real nexus between the grounds and the impugned order, then the order of preventive detention is invalid.76 It is now a very well-settled rule that if any one of the several grounds on which a detention order is based is either non-existent or irrelevant, then the detention order will be held to be invalid even though the other grounds may be good. The reason is that, in such a case, it can never be predicted as to what extent the bad ground operated on the mind of the detaining authority; whether relevant and admissible or irrelevant or non-existent ground gave the requisite satisfaction to the concerned authority, or whether the detention order would have been made at all if the bad ground was excluded and only the good grounds were placed before the authority making the order.77 This judicially-developed rule is sought to be diluted by statutory provisions.

    "content": "instance, S. 5A of COFEPOSA provides that when a detention order is passed on several grounds, it \"shall be deemed to have been made separately on each of such grounds\". Accordingly, the order shall not be invalid merely because any of the grounds is--(1) vague; (ii) non-existent; (iii) not relevant; (iv) not connected or not proximately connected with such person; or (v) invalid for any reason whatsoever; and it is not, therefore, possible to hold that the government or the officer making the order would have been satisfied with reference to the remaining grounds and made the order. The officer or the government is to be deemed to be satisfied on the remaining grounds and made the order of detention. S. 5A envisages that when a detention order is made on two or more grounds, then such detention order is to be deemed to have been made separately. Such detention order is not to be invalid even if one such ground is vague, non-existent, not relevant or not proximately connected. S. 5A cannot apply when the order is based only on one ground. Thus, when a detention order was made on the basis of several allegations of smuggling, and one of these was found to be vague or not relevant, the detention was not held to be illegal because of S. 5A.78 S. 5A represents a serious inroad in the scope of judicial review of preventive detention which was already very much circumscribed and only of a marginal nature. (h) DETAINING AUTHORITY TO FILE AFFIDAVIT As already stated, issuing a preventive detention order is a matter of subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority.79 The Supreme Court has, therefore, developed the norm that when a detenu moves a petition for habeas corpus challenging his detention, the counter-affidavit on behalf of the State ought to be made by the very authority on whose subjective satisfaction the detention order was made. If for sufficient reason to the Court's satisfaction, the affidavit of such an authority cannot be furnished, then the affidavit should be sworn by some responsible officer who has personally dealt with, or has processed, the detenu's case. An affidavit from an officer who has at no time personally dealt with the matter, and thus has no personal knowledge of the detenu's case, but depends only on paper knowledge is improper.80 The Supreme Court has reiterated this view in Gazi Khan:81 in response to the rule nisi, a counter-affidavit should normally be filed by the detaining authority himself. Though it is not a rigid or inflexible rule and a counter-affidavit may be sworn by a responsible officer who personally dealt with the case or by an officer duly authorised under the Rules of Business of the government concerned. But when subjective satisfaction of the concerned authority is challenged on such grounds as mala fides, Page 1343 colourable exercise of power, extraneous considerations, abuse of power or personal bias, failure to file the affidavit by the authority itself, taken in conjunction with other circumstances, may amount to a serious infirmity leading to the invalidation of the detention order. The reason for such a judicial approach is that subjective satisfaction being a mental state is established best by the affidavit of the authority concerned and not by that of a stranger in the secretariat familiar with only papers. The Court has emphasized that this is not a mere formality because the subject-matter is personal liberty, and the more subjective the executive's operation the more sensitive is procedural insistence.82 There have been cases where orders of preventive detention have been quashed because the affidavit was filed not by the concerned district magistrate making the order but by some oneelse in the office. Such an affidavit was held as not filed by a competent person.83 In Gazi Khan,84 the order of preventive detention was passed by the Secretary, Home Department, but the counter-affidavit was filed by a police officer having no personal knowledge of the facts of the case. The Court rejected the affidavit with the following remarks: \"This practice of allowing a police officer who has not dealt with the case at any point of time at any level and who in the very nature of the case could not have any personal knowledge of the proceedings, to swear the counter and reply affidavits on behalf of the appropriate authorities should be highly deprecated and condemned and the counter and reply affidavits sworn by such officer merit nothing but rejection\".85 But there are cases where the Court has adopted a soft line on the issue of filing affidavits. In the absence of any allegations of mala fides, a responsible officer who has personally dealt with or processed the case may file a counter affidavit. For example, in Jagdev Singh,86 the Court has said that failure of the district magistrate to file an affidavit himself is an impropriety and in many cases it may not be of much consequence. In the instant case, the affidavit was filed by the Deputy Secretary (Home). This was held not to vitiate the detention as there was no allegation of mala fides against the district magistrate who was the detaining authority. The Supreme Court has also emphasized that there should be greater precision and perspicuity in affidavits filed in the Court. \"Care and clarity are particularly important when the Court is concerned with questions of personal freedom.\"87 (i) PROCEDURE ESTABLISHED BY LAW Under Art. 21, a person may not be deprived of his personal liberty except only in accordance with the procedure established by law.88 Therefore, in a matter of preventive detention, the Administration must follow scrupulously and strictly the procedural norms laid down in clauses 4 to 7 of Art. 22,89 and in the relevant preventive detention law under which the order in question has been made. Deviation from the procedure to the disadvantage of the detenu would render the detention invalid. It does not matter whether the irregularity is of form or substance.",

    "content": "and in the relevant preventive detention law under which the order in question has been made. Deviation from the procedure to the disadvantage of the detenu would render the detention invalid. It does not matter whether the irregularity is of form or substance. Since preventive detention affects an individual's right to freedom of his person, courts seek to interpret the law strictly, as far as possible, in favour of the affected individual. Hence, the relevant constitutional and statutory provisions, as interpreted by the Courts, are treated as mandatory, and failure to observe even a single procedural safeguard makes detention bad. In this connection, the Supreme Court has observed, underlining the significance of procedural safeguards in preventive detention cases:90 \"The procedural requirements are the only safeguards available to a detenu since the Court is not expected to go behind the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority. The procedural requirements are, therefore, to be strictly complied with if any value is to be attached to the liberty of the subject and the constitutional rights guaranteed to him in that regard. If a reference to an Advisory Board is to be made within three weeks, it is no answer to say that the reference, though not made within three weeks, was made before the hearing of the case. If the report of the Advisory Board is to be obtained within three months, it is no answer to say that the report, though not obtained within three months was obtained before the hearing of the case\". The Supreme Court has emphasized upon the importance of the rules of procedure in this area in the following words: \"The history of personal liberty is largely the history of insistence on observance of procedure. And observance of procedure has been the bastion against wanton assaults on personal liberty Page 1344 over the years.\"91 A few examples of the application of this principle may be cited here. If the relevant statute enjoins the advisory board to give its report within a stipulated time, failure to do so will vitiate the detention.92 It is illegal for the original detention order to straight away fix the period of detention, for the scheme of the constitutional provisions is that every case should be placed before an advisory board and the government could confirm the detention beyond three months only after the board holds the detention to be justified. Fixing the period of detention before the board has gone into the case is bound to prejudice the detenu.93 When the law requires a board of three members, a board of two members is not properly constituted and a reference to such a board is no reference at all in the eyes of the law.94 If the advisory board opines that the detenu be released, the government is bound to release him. Even if the board advises against the release, the government may still release him if it so likes. S. 3(5) of NSA requires that the State Government shall report within seven days to the Central Government the fact of an order of preventive detention having been made, or approved by it. Infringement of this procedural safeguard vitiates the detention.95 Each of the three Central preventive laws requires96 the advisory board to hear the detenu in person if he desires to be heard before making its report on his detention. The Supreme Court has emphasized that when a detenu desires to be heard in person by the advisory board, the authority concerned is peremptorily required to afford to the detenu a proper opportunity to be heard. The opportunity must be effective and not a sham or farce. The detenu has a statutory right to be heard by the advisory board.97 S. 10 of NSA runs as follows: \"In every case where a detention order has been made under this Act, the appropriate Government shall, within three weeks from the date of detention of person under the order, place before the advisory board constituted by it under section 9, the grounds on which the order has been made and the representation, if any, made by the person affected by the order\". Commenting on the above provision, the Supreme Court has emphasized in State of Rajasthan v. Shamsher Singh1 that the obligation cast under S. 10 is \"paramount\" and the \"strictness with which such a mandate has to be complied with is absolute.2 The legislative scheme contained in S. 10 envisages that there may be a case where the detenu makes no representation within the time contemplated in S. 10. \"While making of the reference under S. 10 with the grounds of detention is a must, furnishing of the representation is conditional upon it having been made and receipt thereof by the appropriate Government.' It is obligatory for the government to forward the representation when received. S. 11 indicates that the Board is to consider the materials placed before it. The Board is entitled to call for such information as it may deem necessary from the government or any other person concerned. After hearing the detenu, if he wants to be heard in person, the Board has to report to the appropriate government within seven weeks from the date of detention. The Board is not required to write out a judgment wherein one would expect mention of the respective pleas, materials produced by the parties, specification of the contentions advanced and reasons for the conclusions drawn. What is required is the Board's conclusion whether detention order when made and the continued detention of the person concerned is justified. The Board's report is only a recommendation, the ultimate decision rests on the concerned government. Under S. 12, the government has two alternative courses open--(i) if the board holds the detention unjustified, the government has to revoke the order and release the detenu; (ii) if the board holds the detention to be justified, the government may confirm the order and continue the detention.

S. 14(2), NSA, runs as follows: Page 1345 \"The revocation or expiry of a detention order shall not bar the making of a fresh detention order...against the same person in any case where fresh facts have arisen after the date of revocation or expiry...\" Interpreting S. 14(2) of NSA,3 the Supreme Court has held that when a detention order expires or is revoked, or the detenu is released, a fresh order cannot be issued on the very same facts on which the earlier detention order was based. A fresh detention order can be passed only when fresh facts have arisen after the revocation or expiry of the earlier order.4 The same principle applies even when the first order was revoked due to a technical defect, as 'revocation' in S. 14(2) includes cancellation of an order whether valid or invalid.5 The same principle applies when the detention order is held illegal by the court and the detenu is released.6 Thus, once an order of revocation is made, another order detaining the same person can only be passed if some additional or fresh material is in possession of the government on which action can be based. As the Supreme Court has observed in Hadibandhu:7 \"...The revocation or expiry of the previous order cannot lead ipso facto to a revival of the detention by passing of a fresh order, because a person who is entitled to his liberty can only be put in a second jeopardy when there are additional or fresh facts against him\". The Supreme Court has also ruled that when an order of preventive detention is quashed by the Court, the detaining authority cannot make a fresh order on the basis of the same old grounds. When the Court strikes down an order, it nullifies the entire order. This means that the old grounds should not be taken into consideration either as a whole or in part even along with the fresh grounds of detention for drawing the requisite satisfaction to pass a fresh order.8 The Court has observed on this point in Jahangirkhan:9 \"It is therefore clear that an order of detention cannot be made considering the previous grounds of detention when the same had been quashed by the court, and if such previous grounds of detention are taken into consideration while forming the subjective satisfaction by the detaining authority in making a detention order the order of detention will be vitiated. It is of no consequence if the further fresh facts disclosed in the grounds of the impugned detention order have been considered.\"10 Non-confirmation of the detention order within three months amounts to its revocation. Thus, the word 'revoke' has been given a broad interpretation to favour the detenu. It is not necessary to fix the maximum period of detention while confirming the detention order for this is ipso facto subject to the maximum period fixed in the relevant statute.11 (j) REASONABLE PROCEDURE Art. 21 now signifies that the procedure prescribed by law to deprive a person of his personal liberty must be \"reasonable, fair and just\".12 The law of preventive detention must also pass this test. It is, therefore, necessary that the preventive detention procedure be fair.13 In A.K. Roy v. Union of India, 14the procedure laid down in Sections 10 and 11 of the National Security Act, 1980,15 was challenged as being not in consonance with natural justice on at least three grounds: (i) the detenu has not been given the right to cross-examine the detaining authority and the persons on whose statements the order of detention is founded; (ii) the Act does not give the detenu the right to present before the advisory board oral and documentary evidence in rebuttal of the allegations made against him; (iii) the Act does not furnish to the detenu the right to be represented by a lawyer of his choice before the advisory board. The Supreme Courtupheld the Act on all these counts. The Court did recognise the importance of these three rights. They constitute the core of just process because, without them, it is difficult for any person to disprove the allegations made against him and to establish the truth. But two important considerations must be borne in mind in this regard: (i) There is no prescribed standard of reasonableness and, therefore, what kind of processual rights should be made available to a person depends upon the nature of the proceeding in Page 1346 relation to which the rights are claimed. (ii) The question as to what kind of rights are available to the detenu in the proceeding before the advisory board has to be decided in the light of the constitutional provisions, and the statutory provisions to the extent they do not offend the Constitution. The Court ruled that a detenu could not claim the right of cross-examination of witnesses in proceedings before the advisory boards. The rules of natural justice \"are not rigid norms of unchanging content\": the ambit of those rules must vary according to the context, and \"they have to be tailored to suit the nature of the proceedings in relation to which the particular right is claimed as a component of natural justice\". Cross-examination may be necessary in proceedings in which witnesses are examined or documents are adduced in evidence in order to prove a point. Cross-examination is a powerful weapon to expose the untruthfulness of such evidence. But the question for consideration of the advisory board is not whether the detenu is guilty of any charge but whether there is sufficient cause for his detention.",

    "content": "may be necessary in proceedings in which witnesses are examined or documents are adduced in evidence in order to prove a point. Cross-examination is a powerful weapon to expose the untruthfulness of such evidence. But the question for consideration of the advisory board is not whether the detenu is guilty of any charge but whether there is sufficient cause for his detention. The detention is based not on facts proved either by applying the test of preponderance of probabilities or of reasonable doubt, but on the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority. \"The proceeding of the Advisory Board has, therefore, to be structured differently from the proceedings of judicial or quasi-judicial tribunals.\"16 In case of preventive detention, witnesses are either unwilling to come forward, or the sources of information of the detaining authority cannot be disclosed without detriment to public interest. Therefore, in the very nature of things, it is not possible to give to the detenu the right of cross-examination of witnesses. The Court saw no objection in granting to the detenu the right to lead evidence in rebuttal before the Advisory Board. There is no provision in the Constitution or the National Security Act denying to the detenu the right to present his own evidence to rebut the allegations made against him. As the Board is to complete its proceedings within a limited period, it can regulate its own procedure within the constraints of the Constitution and the statute and limit the time within which the detenu must complete the evidence. (k) LEGAL REPRESENTATION As regards the right to legal representation, reading clauses (1) and 3(b) of Article 22 together,17 the express intendment of the Constitution itself is that no person detained under any law of preventive detention can claim the right to consult a legal practitioner of his choice, or be defended by him. According to Art. 22(3)(b), the safeguards provided by Arts. 22(1) and 22(2) do not apply to a person in preventive detention. In view of this, the Court found it difficult to hold, by applying abstract and general principles, or on a priori considerations, that the detenu has the right of legal representation before the advisory board. Since the Constitution itself contemplates that such a right should not be made available to a detenu, its denial cannot be said to be 'unfair, unjust or unreasonable'. Although under Art. 21, the procedure of Advisory Board must be fair, just and reasonable, yet when the Constitution itself provides a yardstick, it would be difficult to hold that the lack of legal representation is unfair, unjust or unreasonable. Had Art. 22 been silent on the question of the right of legal representation, the courts could have held that the detenu ought to have the right of legal representation before the Advisory Board. But that choice was not open to the courts because of the express language of Art. 22(3)(b) read with Article 22(1).18 The Supreme Court has, however, added an important caveat to the denial of legal representation to the detenu before the Advisory Board, viz., that no party, neither the government nor the detaining authority, nor the detenu would have legal representation before the board. Permitting legal representation to the government or the detaining authority, but denying the same to the detenu would amount to a breach of Article 14.19 Therefore, if the detaining authority or the government takes the aid of a legal practitioner before the Board, the detenu must be allowed the same facility. The Court has also banned the practice of government officers in the concerned departments appearing before the Board to justify detention orders. This amounts to doing 'indirectly' what could not be done 'directly'. These officers should also be regarded as legal practitioners, for regard must be had to the substance and not the form. Thus, in proceedings of advisory boards, \"whosoever assists or advises on facts or law must be deemed to be in the position of a legal adviser\". The Court has, however, asserted that the Page 1347 detenu should not be prevented from being aided or assisted by a friend who is not a legal practitioner. If a detenu demands such a facility, the Advisory Board must grant it to him. The question of legal representation before the Advisory Board has been raised in a number of cases. S. 8(e) Cofeposa says that a detenu \"shall not be entitled to appear by any legal practitioner\" before the Advisory Board. The Supreme Court has observed in Kavita v. State of Maharashtra, 20 in the context of S. 8(e) of COFEPOSA that this provision \"disentitles a detenu from claiming as of right to be represented by a lawyer\", but \"it does not disentitle him from making a request for the services of a lawyer\". In Kavita,21 the Court has emphasized that often adequate legal assistance may be essential to protect the Fundamental Right to life and personal liberty guaranteed by Art. 21 as well as by the statutory provision giving a right to be heard to a detenu. This valuable right may be jeopardized without adequate legal assistance because of the intricacies of the problems involved and other relevant factors. Therefore, whether or not legal assistance should be afforded by the advisory board necessarily depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. The Court has observed, \"...Where a detenu makes a request for legal assistance, his request would have to be considered on its own merit in each individual case.\"22 The Court has further ruled that it was for the Advisory Board, and not for the government, to afford legal assistance to the detenu. Request for permission to be represented by a lawyer should be made to the Board. In Nandlal v. State of Punjab, 23 the detenu made the request for legal assistance but it was denied by the Board. At the same time, the Board allowed legal representation to the detaining authority.",

    "content": "for permission to be represented by a lawyer should be made to the Board. In Nandlal v. State of Punjab, 23 the detenu made the request for legal assistance but it was denied by the Board. At the same time, the Board allowed legal representation to the detaining authority. The Court held that such \"differential treatment\" accorded to the detenu was based on no \"rational basis\". Although the detenu had no right to legal assistance in the proceedings before the Board, the Board was not precluded from allowing such assistance to the detenu, particularly, when it allowed legal representation to the State. The procedure followed by the Board was held to be arbitrary vitiating the impugned order. Arbitrariness of procedure adopted by the Advisory Board would vitiate the order of preventive detention. The Court emphasized that the Board's procedure must be just and fair to both the parties. The Court went on to suggest that Parliament should provide for legal representation before the Advisory Board in the law itself. The Advisory Board denied to the petitioner detained under COFEPOSA the right to be represented by a friend who was not a legal practitioner. In Mohd. Zabbar v. State of Rajasthan, 24 the Supreme Court said that the right to be represented by a friend before the Advisory Board was recognised and well-settled as a result of the Roy decision.25 In the instant case, the denial to the detenu to be represented by a friend was without any reason and so the Court quashed the detention. The Court refused to accept the request of the State to remand the case to the Advisory Board for a re-hearing saying that \"the procedure followed by the advisory board which involved a denial of a valuable right to the petitioner, unquestionably vitiated the entire proceedings before it\" and, therefore, the continued detention of the petitioner would be illegal and the same must be quashed. Though, a detenu may not have a right to legal representation before an advisory board, he may make such a request to the Board which is bound to consider it.26 In Hemalata v. State of Maharashtra27, the Supreme Court has reiterated that section 8(e) of COFEPOSA28 does not bar legal representation of a detenu by a lawyer. Only that a detenu cannot claim legal representation as of right. This section gives the Board \"a discretion to permit or not to permit representation of the detenu by counsel according to the necessity in a particular case\". Certain cases may be complicated and assistance of lawyers may be necessary on behalf of the parties to explain the facts and law involved therein. In the instant case, the Board rejected the detenu's request for legal representation on the ground that the Board had never permitted a legal practitioner to appear before it. Was this ground to refuse legal representation tenable in law? The Court avoided giving a direct answer to this question, saying that it was merely academic for two reasons: (i) The Advisory Board whose action was being challenged was not a party before the Court; and (ii) the board had already reviewed the case of the detenu and on its opinion the government confirmed the detention. However, the answer to the question raised in this case seems to be that refusal by the board to permit legal representation merely on the basis of the past practice, without Page 1348 considering the merits of the case, was unjustified. In this connection, reference may be made to Lord Denning's opinion in the Pett case.29 The question of assistance to the detenu before the Advisory Board has been further considered by the Supreme Court in Johney D'couto v. State of Tamil Nadu .30 The appellant was detained under S. 3(1) of Cofeposa. He requested the Advisory Board to permit a retired assistant collector of central excise to assist him as a friend. The detaining authority was being represented by the deputy collector of customs. The appellant's request was denied by the Advisory Board. The Court ruled that as held in A.K. Roy, a detenu would be entitled to the assistance of a 'friend'. The Court now gave a wider connotation to the term 'friend' as meaning not necessarily a person well known to the detenu but a person who would be willing to assist him. It was therefore wrong on the part of the Advisory Board to refuse the detenu the assistance of the person concerned 'as a friend', especially when the detaining authority was being assisted by the highly placed customs officers. In a case of preventive detention under PBMMSEC while the government was represented before the advisory board by highly placed police officers, the detenu was denied the permission to seek the help of a lawyer or a friend. The Supreme Court quashed the detention order saying that in the situation, the Board ought to have permitted the detenu to have the assistance of a friend who could have made an equally effective representation on his behalf. The Board should have avoided any action which could give the appearance of unequal treatment or unreasonableness.31 In Anil Vats v. Union of India, 32 the Supreme Court has objected to the refusal by the advisory board to the detenu to be assisted by a friend on the ground that the detenu being a graduate could represent himself. The Court saw no reason why the detenu should have been refused the assistance of a friend. Being a graduate is not sufficient to deny to the detenu the assistance of a friend. Being in custody, the detenu may not be properly served by his memory; he may be nervous, incoherent and his faculties may be benumbed. Assistance of a friend would result in fairness of procedure towards the detenu. The detention was quashed as the procedural safeguard envisaged by Art. 22(5) was not satisfied in this case.33 In Francis Coralie v. Union Territory of Delhi, 34 by applying Art.",

Assistance of a friend would result in fairness of procedure towards the detenu. The detention was quashed as the procedural safeguard envisaged by Art. 22(5) was not satisfied in this case.33 In Francis Coralie v. Union Territory of Delhi, 34 by applying Art. 21 to the area of preventive detention, the Supreme Court has held that a detenu has a right to consult a legal adviser of his choice for securing release from preventive detention. This right can, however, be regulated by a valid regulation which is reasonable, fair and just; but the regulation cannot prescribe an arbitrary or unreasonable procedure for regulating such an interview, otherwise it would be violative of Arts. 14 and 21. Thus, a provision permitting a legal adviser to have interview with a detenu only by prior appointment, after obtaining permission of the district magistrate, and in the presence of the concerned officers would cause great hardship and inconvenience and make the right to consult a legal adviser 'illusory', and so would be invalid under Arts. 14 and 21.35 The Court has laid down the following guiding norm for this purpose. A detenu can have interview with his legal adviser at any reasonable hour during the day after taking appointment with the Superintendent of Jail who should give such an appointment without any avoidable delay. If thought necessary, an official may be present at this time, but he should not be within the hearing distance of the detenu and the legal adviser. (l) MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS The Supreme Court has refused to throw open the proceedings of the Advisory Board to the public.36 Under S. 10 of the Cofeposa Act the maximum period of detention is fixed at one year although it may be increased to two years under S. 9. The Supreme Court has now clarified that the period of detention is to be computed from the date of the actual detention and not from the date of the order of detention.37 Under S. 12, a detenu can be released on parole, but not on bail. The Supreme Court has recently ruled that the period of parole is to be counted towards the period of detention while computing the total period of detention. In Sunil Fulchand Shah v. Union of India, 38 the Court has observed on this point: \"Since, release on parole is only a temporary arrangement by which a detenu is released for a temporary fixed period to meet certain situations, it does not interrupt the period of detention and, thus, needs to be counted towards the total Page 1349 period of detention unless the rules, instructions or terms for grant of parole, prescribe otherwise. The period during which parole is availed of is not aimed to extend the outer limit of the maximum period of detention indicated in the order of detention.\" Under S. 11 of the COFEPOSA, the Central Government may revoke an order of detention at any time, whether the order is made by the State or the Central Government. Similar provisions are to be found in the other two Acts, i.e., S. 14 in NSA, and S. 14 in PBMSECA. This implies that the detenu can make a representation for the exercise of this power. A petition for revocation of a detention order should be disposed of with reasonable expedition. The government would not be justified in ignoring the representation as a statutory duty is cast upon it. The government must apply its mind and either revoke the detention order or reject the petition. When the representation remained pending for four months, the Court felt that the detention could no longer be justified as being according to the procedure.39 (m) TREATMENT OF DETENUS In Francis Coralie,40 the Supreme Court has invoked Art. 21 to extract a few additional safeguards for the detenus over and above those provided by Art. 22. A person entering prison does not lose all his Fundamental Rights, though some of his rights shrink somewhat because of his incarceration. A person preventively detained is not convicted of any crime and, therefore, only minimal restrictions ought to be placed on him consistent with the effectiveness of his detention. The right to life enshrined in Art. 21 is \"of the widest amplitude and it covers a variety of rights\". It does not mean mere animal existence or just physical survival.41 Any act which damages or injures or interferes with the use of any limb or faculty of a person, either permanently or temporarily, falls within the inhibition of Art. 21. But the right to life envisages something more than mere protection of limb or faculty of a detenu; it also includes \"the right to live with human dignity\". This means that the detenu must have bare necessities of life, such as, adequate nutrition, clothing and shelter and facilities for writing and expressing himself in diverse forms, freely moving about and mixing and commingling with fellow human beings. Any form of torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment offensive to human dignity is unconstitutional. A stricter approach last taken in a case where a detenu had made allegations against the police atrocities and claimed to be a victim of custodial violence in respect of earlier detentions. The court said that the detaining authority need not wait till the inquiry was conducted and report submitted on the allegations before preventively detaining the detenu on new grounds.42 A detenu should be kept separately from the convicts. A necessary component of the right to live with human dignity is the right to have interviews with the members of his family and friends and no prison regulation regulating this right can be regarded as constitutionally valid unless it is reasonable, fair and just.",

    "content": "necessary component of the right to live with human dignity is the right to have interviews with the members of his family and friends and no prison regulation regulating this right can be regarded as constitutionally valid unless it is reasonable, fair and just. If any such prison regulation (or procedure laid down by it) regulating the right of the detenu to have interviews with his friends and family members is arbitrary or unreasonable, it would be invalid as violating Arts. 14 and 21. Restricting interviews once a month to a detenu is arbitrary and not reasonable because even a convicted prisoner is permitted to have interviews with his relatives and friends once a week. A detenu stands on a higher pedestal than a convicted prisoner and so he should be permitted to have at least two interviews in a week. Again in Roy,43 the Supreme Court has asserted that the basic commitment of the Constitution is to foster human dignity and the well-being of the people. The Court has, therefore, stressed upon the government to afford all reasonable facilities to the detenus for an existence consistent with human dignity. The detenus must be segregated from the ordinary convicts and kept in a separate part of the place of detention; they should be permitted to wear their own clothes, eat their own food, have interviews with their family-members at least once a week and have reading and writing material according to their reasonable requirements. (n) CONCLUDING REMARKS Page 1350 In the area of preventive detention, the range of administrative control over an individual's personal liberty is vast. On the other hand, the range of judicial control in this area is very restricted as the basic question, whether a person should be detained or not on the facts and circumstances of the case, lies within the scope of administrative subjective discretion and is beyond judicial review. The scheme of the Constitution is that the administrative decision to detain a person should be open to review by the advisory boards and not by the courts. However, being conscious of the fact that to maintain constitutionalism44 within the country, the executive power needs to be controlled, the judiciary in India has used its limited power in a creative manner and has played an active role in overseeing the administration in the exercise of its power, by pressing into service the principles of Administrative Law to control discretionary power. Although the courts have sought to expand the scope of judicial review of detention orders, the fact remains that, on the whole, the judicial review in this area remains marginal and peripheral. Preventive detention has been operative in India since 1950, barring brief respites. There does not appear to be any prospect of the law being withdrawn in the near future. The rigours of preventive detention as it operates in India thus need to be softened by providing some more safeguards to the detenu. For example: (1) detention cases should be reviewed periodically, say, at an interval of three months, so that those whose detention no longer appears to be necessary may be released. (2) Parole provisions in the law may be used more frequently. (3) The order passed by the advisory boards and the government should be 'speaking orders'. (4) There should be a constitutional obligation on Parliament to prescribe the maximum period of detention. Today this is optional. This involves a suitable amendment of Art. 22(7)(b). (5) Art. 22(7)(a) should be repealed so that in no case the protection of an advisory board is withdrawn from the detenu. (6) The detenu should be provided with legal assistance in preparing his representation for it may be quite difficult for an inarticulate detenu to draft his representation and properly marshal the facts and evidence in his favour. When the government has lawyers at its disposal, it is unfair to deny the services of a lawyer to a detenu. (7) A lawyer should be permitted to appear before the advisory board to represent the detenu. The advisory boards consist of lawyers as member and they will not feel embarrassed if lawyers were to appear before them. (8) The detenu should have a right to lead evidence before the advisory board in his defence and to controvert the facts and evidence which the administration may have collected against him. This is essential because the Courts have refused to assume responsibility of probing in to the facts on which detention is based to find out if they are correct or false. This right has now been accepted by the Supreme Court in Roy.45 (9) The advisory boards need to be strengthened. This is very important for they stand between the detenu and the administrative power to detain and, thus, constitute the crucial safeguard in preventive detention cases. The Constitution requires that professional lawyers be appointed to these boards, but that by itself would not be much of a safeguard because much depends on the quality of people who are actually appointed. The boards do not appear to be acting very effectively as is clear from the fact that the courts, even with their limited powers, are able to quash detention orders in quite a few cases. The boards are at present regarded as appendages of the Administration and do not carry much credibility in the public eye. To make them effective and independent of the Administration, the best course will be to appoint sitting High Court Judges to these boards. The Judges have a constitutionally guaranteed tenure and, thus, can bring to bear an independent mind on the administrative decision to detain a person. (10) It means, therefore, that the modifications made in Arts. 22(4) to (7) by the 44th Constitutional Amendment should be implemented by notification in the gazette without any further delay.46 Page 1351 With these amendments chances of abuse or misuse of the power to order preventive detention would be very much reduced.",

Most of the sections of The Constitution (Forty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1978 have been notified except section 3 by which Art. 22 was to be amended: [see GSR 383(E), dated 19-6-1979, GSR 383(E), dated 19-6-1979 and GSR 529(E), dated 5-9-1979]. M P Jain Indian Constitutional Law/Volume 1/PART V POLITICAL AND CIVIL RIGHTS/CHAPTER XXVII-A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS (8A) (Right to Education) CHAPTER XXVII-A Fundamental Rights (8A) (Right to Education) A. RIGHT TO EDUCATION The right to education was initially not included as a fundamental right in the Constitution and was included Page 1363 as a directive principle under Article 45 which required the State to endeavour to provide, within a period of 10 years from the commencement of the Constitution, for free and compulsory education for all children until they complete the age of 14 years. The directive in Art. 45 was not confined merely to primary education; it extended to providing free education up to the age of 14 years, whatever the stage of education it came to. Therefore, education for children of this age group should have been free, ideally speaking, at the latest by 1960. However, only fitful efforts were made by some States to pass laws according to Article 45.1 More than 43 years passed in this fashion. B. FREE AND COMPULSORY EDUCATION AS A DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLE During this period the Supreme Court implied the \"right to education\" from other Articles of the Constitution such as Arts. 21, 24, 30(1) and 39(e)and (f). In Kerala, schools are run primarily by religious minority groups. The State banned charging of fees from students in the primary classes, but made no provision for payment of grants to compensate the schools for the loss of revenue thus caused to them. This was held to contravene Art. 30(1).2 The Court emphasized that the solemn obligation placed on the State by Art. 45 \"to provide for free and compulsory education for children\" can be discharged by it through government and aided schools and that Art. 45 \"does not require that obligation to be discharged at the expense of the minority communities.\"3 In Unnikrishnan,4 the Supreme Court implied the right to education from the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed by Art. 21. As the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles are complementary to each other, the content and parameters of this right were deduced in the light of Arts. 41, 45, 46. Therefore, the right to education in the context of these Directive Principles means: (a) every child has a right to free education upto the age of 14 years; (b) thereafter, his right to education is circumscribed by the limits of the economic capacity of the state and its development. The Court had emphasized that \"a child (citizen) has a Fundamental Right to free education up to the age of 14 years.\"5 This obligation can be discharged by the state either through governmental schools, or private schools run by non-governmental bodies, aided and recognised by the state. The Court further ruled that a citizen has a right to call upon the state to provide educational facilities within the limits of its economic capacity and development. This does not mean that the Supreme Court was seeking to transform a Directive Principle (Art. 41) into a Fundamental Right. What the Court was doing was \"merely relying upon Art. 41 to illustrate the content of the right to education flowing from Art. 21.\"6 The Court has however cautioned that just because it has relied upon some of the Directive Principles to locate the parameters of the right to education implicit in Art. 21, \"it does not follow automatically that each and every obligation referred to [in the Directive Principles] gets automatically included within the purview of Art. 21. We have held the right to education to be implicit in the right to life because of its inherent fundamental importance. As a matter of fact, we have referred to Arts. 41, 45 and 46 merely to determine the parameters of the said right.\"7 Art. 45 was also construed as supplementary to Art.",

As a matter of fact, we have referred to Arts. 41, 45 and 46 merely to determine the parameters of the said right.\"7 Art. 45 was also construed as supplementary to Art. 24 which bars employment of a child below the age of 14 years.8 for if the child is not to be employed below the age of 14, he must be kept occupied in some educational institution. Art. 45 also supplemented Arts. 39(e) and (f) and.9 C. RIGHT TO EDUCATION UNDER ART. 21 The Supreme Court has implied the \"Right to Education\" as a fundamental right from Art. 21. The word 'life' has been held to include 'education' because education promotes good and dignified life. The Supreme Court has held that it is the duty of the State government to provide access to education and unless new schools in the private sector are permitted it will not be possible for the state to discharge its constitutional obligation. Hence there is no illegality in the government permitting new schools to be Page 1364 established on permanent no-grant basis without any financial commitment on its part subject to such schools following the parameters and conditions prescribed by the Education Code.10 The question arose for the first time before a two Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in Mohini Jain v. State of Karnataka, 11 in the following factual context. With a view to eliminating the practice of collecting capitation fee for admitting students in educational institutions, the Karnataka Legislature passed an Act purporting to regulate tuition fee in private medical colleges in the State. By issuing a notification under the Act, the Government fixed Rs. 2000/- per year as tuition fee payable by candidates admitted against 'government seats', but other students from the State were to pay Rs. 25,000/- per annum. The Indian students from outside the State were to pay Rs. 60,000/- per annum. On a writ petition filed by an out of the State student, the Supreme Court quashed the notification under Art. 14. In justification of the notification, the private medical colleges had argued that they did not receive any financial aid from the Government and so they must charge much higher fees from private students to make good the loss incurred on government students. The Court accepted that the Constitution does not expressly guarantee the right to education, as such, as a Fundamental Right. But reading cumulatively Art. 21 along with the Directive Principles contained in Arts. 38, 39(a), 41 and 45, the Court opined that \"it becomes clear that the framers of the Constitution made it obligatory for the State to provide education for its citizens.\" The Court argued that without making the right to education under Art. 41 a reality, the Fundamental Rights would remain beyond the reach of a large majority which is illiterate; the Fundamental Rights including the freedom of speech and expression and other rights guaranteed under Art. 19, cannot be fully appreciated and fully enjoyed unless a citizen is educated and is conscious of his individualistic dignity. Further, 'life' in Art. 21 means right to live with human dignity. \"Right to life\" is the compendious expression for all those rights which are basic to the dignified enjoyment of life. Thus, ruled the Court, \"the right to education flows directly from the right to life,\" and that the \"right to education\" being concomitant to the fundamental rights, \"the State is under a constitutional mandate to provide educational institutions at all levels for the benefit of the citizens.\" The main question before the Bench was whether it would be permissible for private but government recognised educational institutions to charge capitation fee for the admission of the students. The Bench characterised capitation fee as \"nothing but a price for selling education\" and amounts to commercialization of education adversely affecting educational standards. The Court characterised institutions charging capitation fee as \"teaching shops\". \"The concept of 'teaching shops' is contrary to the constitutional scheme and is wholly abhorrent to the Indian culture and heritage.\" The Bench declared that charging capitation fee amounts to discrimination on a class basis and is thus denial of Art. 14 because a poor meritorious student is denied admission to these institutions because he has no money whereas the rich can purchase education. Such a treatment is patently unreasonable, unfair and unjust.12 The Court further observed in this connection:13 \"Restricting admission to non-meritorious candidates belonging to the richer section of society and denying the same to poor meritorious is wholly arbitrary against the constitutional scheme and as such cannot be legally permitted. Capitation fee in any form cannot be sustained in the eye of law. The only method of admission to the medical colleges in consonance with fair play and equity is by way of merit and merit alone.\" The Bench thus declared charging of capitation fee by the State recognised educational institutions as \"wholly arbitrary and as such violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution.\" Referring to the fixing of Rs. 60,000/- as tuition fee for outside State students in the impugned notification, the Court observed: Page 1365 \"Whatever name one may give to this extraction of money in the name of medical education it is nothing but the capitation fee and as such cannot be sustained and is liable to be struck down.\" Taking an absolutist view of the State obligation to provide education at all levels, the Bench observed: \"We hold that every citizen has a 'right to education' under the Constitution. The State is under an obligation to establish educational institutions to enable the citizens to enjoy the said right.",

    "content": "State is under an obligation to establish educational institutions to enable the citizens to enjoy the said right. The State may discharge its obligation through State-owned or State recognised educational institutions...Charging capitation fee in consideration of admission to educational institutions, is a patent denial of a citizen's right to education under the Constitution.\"14 In Mohini Jain, the Court took an extremely expansive view of State obligation to provide education to every one at all levels. The State should provide adequate number of institutions of higher and professional education as there may be need for. From a practical point of view, such an approach was hardly viable, feasible and tenable in the present-day economic situation of the country, for no State has the financial wherewithal to meet public demand for professional colleges. The Mohini Jain ruling would have placed an impossible financial burden on the State Governments to provide education to all. All private educational institutions would have closed down and only government aided institutions would have survived. There seems to be no justification to completely oust private institutions from the field of higher education; there seems to be no need to bar private initiative from the field of professional education. There should be some place under the sun for good private institutions imparting high level of professional education. Of course, care has to be taken that these institutions are run more on academic principles and in the spirit of doing social service rather than on mercenary lines. After all, in the U.S.A. some of the best educational institutions are private ones. Further, it seems axiomatic that if private institutions are not to be aided by the Government then necessarily they have to charge higher fees to make their both ends meet. No State at present has the wherewithal to meet the public demand for professional colleges. Accordingly, the matter whether the State could permit private professional educational institutions to charge capitation fee for admission of students came to be reconsidered in Unni Krishnan by a larger Bench of five judges. The Court reiterated the proposition that having regard to the fundamental significance of education to the life of an individual and the nation, the right to education is implicit in, and flows from, the right to life guaranteed by Art. 21. But, said the Court, the parameters of this right, which is not absolute, have to be determined in the light of the Directive Principles contained in Arts. 41, 45 and 46.15 The Court limited the State obligation to provide educational facilities as follows: (i) Every citizen has a right to free education until he completes the age of 14 years; (ii) Beyond that stage, the State obligation to provide education is subject to the \"limits of the economic capacity and development\" of the State. The obligations created by Arts. 41, 45 and 46 can be discharged by the State either by establishing institutions of its own, or by aiding, recognizing and/or granting affiliations to private educational institutions. Taking note of the inadequate outlay on education and limited economic capacity of the State to finance education, the Court ruled that private educational institutions, both aided and unaided, are a necessity in India, but \"commercialization of education cannot and should not to be permitted.\" While denouncing the levy of \"capitation fee\" by certain professional colleges, the Court has however accepted that unaided private educational institutions can charge higher tuition fee; they \"have to and are entitled to charge a higher fee, but not exceeding the ceiling fixed.\" The Court has also noted that Art. 14 applies to the State educational institutions. Art. 14 compels them to admit students on merit, subject to any permissible reservation, wherein again merit inter se has to be followed. The educational activity being carried out by private institutions is supplemental to the main effort being made by the State. And, therefore, as Art. 14 applies to the main activity it also supplies equally to the Page 1366 supplemental activity as well. As Art. 14 applies to the State institutions, its application \"cannot be excluded from the supplemental effort/activity\". The implication of this statement is that even the private educational institutions are required to admit students on merit and merit alone. The policy of admissions should not be based on money considerations but on merit. Meritorious but poor students ought not to be excluded by unmeritorious but rich students. Merit should be a consideration for admission in private colleges. Accordingly, the Court evolved a scheme as regards the level of fees chargeable by private educational institutions as well as the policy for admissions. This scheme was in the nature of guidelines which the appropriate governments and affiliating authorities shall impose and implement in addition to such other conditions and stipulations that they may think appropriate \"for the grant of permission, recognition or affiliation, as the case may be.\" Where 'recognition' or 'affiliation' is granted but not aid, it may not be insisted that such private institutions shall charge only as much fee as is charged in similar courses in government institutions. The scheme was confined to private professional colleges only, namely, private medical colleges, dental colleges and colleges imparting nursing, pharmacy and other courses allied to medicine, private engineering colleges, including those imparting technical education in electronic and computer sciences, etc. The scheme was to apply and govern the admissions to 'professional college' commencing from the academic year 1993-94. The scheme framed by the Court in Unnikrishnan and thereafter followed by the Governments was held to be an unreasonable restriction under Article 19(6) of the Constitution in T.M.A. Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka in respect of private unaided educational institutions.16 The Court was of the opinion that: \"The scheme has the effect of nationalizing education in respect of important features viz.",

    "content": "right of a private unaided institution to give admission and to fix the fee.\" The scheme relating to the grant of admission and the fixing of the fee framed in Unni Krishnan, has been replaced by another judicially evolved scheme, albeit as a temporary measure in T.M.A Pai as elaborated on in Islamic Academy of Education v. State of Karnataka17 and P.A. Inamdar v. State of Maharashtra.18 Confusion as to the say of the Government particularly in the matter of admission and fee fixation in private unaided educational institutions continues, with courts resorting to a certain amount of ad hocism in resolving disputes.19 D. THE RIGHT TO EDUCATION AS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT Subsequent to the decision in Unnikrishnan, the Constitution (Eighty-Sixth Amendment) Act, 2002 introduced Article 21A which makes the right to education a fundamental right. The Article requires the State to provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years in such manner as the State may, by law, determine. Compulsoriness is sought to be ensured in the amendment of article 51A in the Chapter on Fundamental Duties by adding clause (k) and making it incumbent on a parent or guardian to provide opportunities for education to his child or, as the case may be, ward between the age of six and fourteen years.20 At the same time a new article was substituted in place of article 45 which directs the State to endeavour to provide early childhood care and education for all children until they complete the age of six years. Earlier decisions on the scope of the right in the context of the unamended Art. 45 would be relevant in construing the parameters of the right under Art. 21-A with the rider that the right to education being now a fundamental right, it can be enforced as such. Article 21-A, has been described as the most important fundamental right and stands above other rights, \"as one's ability to enforce one's fundamental rights flows from one's education\".21 To promote the educational advancement of the socially and educationally backward classes of citizens i.e. the OBCs or the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in matters of admission of students to unaided Page 1367 educational institutions other than the minority educational institutions Parliament introduced Article 15(5) by the Constitution (Ninety-third Amendment) Act, 2005.Parliament then passed the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2006 (5 of 2007) to provide greater access to higher education including professional education to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. One of the challenges to the Act in Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India22 was that the shift in priorities from primary education to higher education and the consequent diversion of resources and funds was in violation of the right guaranteed under Art. 21A.23 Keeping the objective of Art. 21-A in mind, its provisions have been liberally construed allowing teachers24 and educational institutions25 to obtain benefits thereunder. The underlying logic is that the grant of benefits to those involved in the process of education would also indirectly benefit those for whom the Article was primarily intended. The same logic persuaded the court to hold that the services of the teachers may not be requisitioned on the days on which the schools are open.26 However claims based on Article 21A to compel the State to give grant in aid27, to control fees charged by private unaided schools28 or to challenge conditions for grant of recognition29 have been negatived by High Courts. Article 21-A read with Article 19(1)(a) has been construed as giving all children the right to have primary education in a medium of instruction of their choice.30 Art. 21A has also been construed as the fundamental right of each and every child to receive education free from fear of security and safety so that children have a right to receive education in a sound and safe building.31 In 2001-2002, the Government launched Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan to make elementary education free. However no Central Legislation was enacted to make the right a reality despite the Court noting in P.A. Inamdar that it was for the Central Government, or for the State Governments, in the absence of a Central legislation, to come out with a detailed well-thought-out legislation on the subject and that such a legislation was long awaited. In 2008, Dalveer Bhandari, J in Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India,32 directed \"the Union of India to set a time-limit within which this article is going to be completely implemented. This time-limit must be set within six months. In case the Union of India fails to fix the time-limit, then perhaps this work will also have to be done by the Court\".33 Ultimately The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, has been enacted by the Parliament. TheAct provides among other things for the right of every child who has attained the age of 6 years to be admitted in a neighbourhood school and to be provided free and compulsory education in such school. Every state is responsible for making such neighbourhood school available. All schools, whether state schools, aided or unaided private schools will now have to provide free and compulsory education up to specified percentages of the total number of children admitted. Charging of capitation fees is prohibited nor can a child or her family be subjected to any screening procedure by a school. In keeping with Art. 51 A, the Act casts a duty on every parent or guardian to admit or cause to be admitted his or her child or ward, as the case may be, to an elementary education in the neighbourhood school.34 1.

Page 1369 M P Jain Indian Constitutional Law/Volume 2/PART V POLITICAL AND CIVIL RIGHTS/CHAPTER XXVIII FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS (9) CHAPTER XXVIII Fundamental Rights (9) A. RIGHT AGAINST EXPLOITATION Articles 23 and 24, though Fundamental Rights, lay dormant for almost thirty-two years after the Constitution came into force and there was hardly any significant judicial pronouncement concerning these constitutional provisions. Since 1982, however, these Articles have assumed great significance and have become potent instruments in the hands of the Courts to ameliorate the pitiable condition of the poor in the country. According to Art. 23(1), traffic in human beings, begar, and other similar forms of forced labour are prohibited and any contravention of this provision shall be an offence punishable in accordance with law. Art. 23(1) proscribes three unsocial practices, viz., (1) begar; (2) traffic in human beings; and (3) forced labour. A significant feature of Art. 23 is that it protects the individual not only against the State but also against private citizens.1 Most of the Fundamental Rights operate as limitations on the power of the State and impose negative obligations on the State not to encroach on individual liberty and the rights are only enforceable against the State.2 But there are certain Fundamental Rights which are enforceable against the whole world, e.g., Arts. 17, 23 and 24. Art. 23 is not limited in its application against the State, but strikes at such practices wherever they are found, and, thus, the sweep of Art. 23 is wide and unlimited. (a) BEGAR ABOLISHED The term begar means compulsory work without any payment. Begar is labour or service which a person is forced to give without receiving any remuneration for it.3 The practice was widely prevalent in the erstwhile princely States in India before the advent of the Constitution. It was a great evil and has, therefore, been abolished through Art. 23(1).4 Withholding of pay of a government employee as a punishment has been held to be invalid in view of Art. 23 which prohibits begar. 'To ask a man to work and then not to pay him any salary or wages savours of begar. It is a Fundamental Right of a citizen of India not to be compelled to work without wages.'5 Article 23 was relied on to direct the State Government to pay amounts towards outstanding salaries of sick Public sector undertakings.6 A village custom requiring every house-holder to offer a day's free labour to village headman infringes Art.",

Page 1 Traffic in women for immoral purposes is also covered by this expression.8 (c) FORCED LABOUR The words 'other similar forms of forced labour' in Art. 23(1) are to be interpreted ejusdem generis. The kind of 'forced labour' contemplated by the Article has to be something in the nature of either traffic in human beings or begar. Conscription for police service or military service cannot come under either.9 The prohibition against forced labour is made subject to one exception. Under Art. 23(2), the State can impose compulsory service for public purposes, and in imposing such service the State shall not make any discrimination on grounds only of religion, race, caste or class or any of them. The State may thus exempt women from compulsory service for that will be discrimination on the ground of sex and this has not been forbidden by Art. 23(2). The State is not obligated to pay for the compulsory service imposed. It was said in justification of this provision in the Constituent Assembly that whenever compulsory service is needed, it shall be demanded from all and if the State demands service from all and does not pay any one, then the State is not committing any very great inequity.10 A rule in the Punjab Civil Service Rules provided that a civil servant under suspension on a charge of misconduct would not retire on his reaching the date of retirement but would remain in service until the enquiry into the charges against him is concluded and a final order passed. The Supreme Court held that this rule did not infringe Art. 23 as it could not be equated to begar or 'forced labour' as the servant on suspension did no work. Even if it came within the term 'forced labour', it was not invalid under Art. 23(2), as retention of the servant was for a public purpose, being in the larger interests of the efficiency of the services. A government servant should remain within the control of the government so long as the inquiry against him is not concluded or final orders are not passed.11 The Government demanding services of teachers for census, election, family planning duties is not violative of Art. 23(1). Such services fall within the meaning of \"public purpose\" under Art. 23(2) and these services can also be treated as national service which is a fundamental duty of every citizen under Art. 51A.12 The Supreme Court has given an expansive significance to the term \"forced labour\" used in Art. 23(1) in a series of cases beginning with the Asiad case in 1982.13 The Court has insisted that Art. 23 is intended to abolish every form of forced labour even if it has origin in a contract. Art. 23 strikes at forced labour in whatever form it may manifest itself, because it is violative of human dignity and is contrary to the basic human values. It was argued in Asiad that Art. 23 should be interpreted as prohibiting not every form of forced labour but only such form thereof as was similar to begar, meaning labour or service which a person is forced to render without receiving any remuneration at all. The Supreme Court rejected this narrow view of Art. 23. Bhagwati, J., said while countering such a view: \"It is difficult to imagine that the Constitution makers should have intended to strike only at certain forms of forced labour leaving it open to the socially or economically powerful sections of the community to exploit the poor and weaker sections by resorting to other forms of forced labour.\" So, the Court insisted that every form of forced labour is within the inhibition of Art. 23 and it makes no difference whether the person who is forced to give his labour or service to another is remunerated or not. Even if remuneration is paid, labour supplied by a person would be hit by Art. 23 if it is forced labour, that is, labour supplied not willingly but as a result of force or compulsion. Even if a person has contracted with another to perform service and there is consideration for such service, \"he cannot be forced, by compulsion of law or otherwise, to continue to perform such service, as that would be forced labour. Not only this. Even payment of wages less than the minimum wages would be regarded as forced labour. Giving a very expansive interpretation to Art. 23, Bhagwati, J., said in the Asiad case:14 Page 2 \"The word 'force' must therefore be construed to include not only physical or legal force but also force arising from the compulsion of economic circumstances which leaves no choice of alternatives to a person in want and compels him to provide labour or service even though the remuneration received for it is less than the minimum wage.\" Bhagwati, J., has argued that ordinarily no one would willingly supply his labour for less than the minimum wages. He will do so only under the force of some compulsion. Under Art. 23, 'forced labour' is prohibited, i.e., labour or service which a person is forced to provide. Bhagwati, J., has emphasized that 'force' which would make labour or service 'forced labour' may arise in several ways.",

    "content": "may be physical force compelling a person to provide labour or service to another, or it may be force exerted through a legal provision, such as, a provision for imprisonment or fine for failure to provide forced labour or service, or it may even be \"compulsion arising from hunger and poverty, want and destitution.\" Any factor depriving a person of a choice of alternatives and compelling him to adopt one particular course of action may properly be regarded as force and if labour or service is compelled as a result of such 'force', it would amount to \"forced labour\". In the words of Bhagwati, J.:15 \"Where a person is suffering from hunger or starvation, when he has no resources at all to fight disease or to feed his wife and children or even to hide their nakedness, where utter grinding poverty has broken his back and reduced him to a State of helplessness and despair and where no other employment is available to alleviate the rigour of his poverty, he would have no choice but to accept any work that comes his way, even if the remuneration offered to him is less than the minimum wage. He would be in no position to bargain with the employer; he would have to accept what is offered to him. And in doing so he would be acting not as a free agent with a choice between alternatives but under the compulsion of economic circumstances and the labour or service provided by him would be clearly 'forced labour'.\" Accordingly, emphasized Bhagwati, J., there is no reason why the word 'forced' in Art. 23 should be read in a narrow and restricted sense so as to be confined only to \"physical or legal force\". The word \"force\" ought to be interpreted to include not only physical or legal force but also force arising from the compulsion of economic circumstances \"which leave no choice of alternatives to a person in want and compels him to provide labour or service even though the remuneration received for it is less than the minimum wage.\" The Court has therefore declared in Asiad:16 \"We are, therefore, of the view that where a person provides labour or service to another for remuneration which is less than the minimum wage, the labour or service provided by him clearly falls within the scope and ambit of the words \"forced labour\" under Article 23.\" Therefore, a complaint that minimum wage is not being paid to the workmen by the government contractors is, in effect and substance, a complaint against violation of the Fundamental Right of the workmen under Art. 23 for providing labour for less than the minimum wage clearly falls within the scope and ambit of the words 'forced labour' in Art. 23. Such a person can come to the court for enforcement of his Fundamental Right under Art. 23 and ask the court to direct payment of the minimum wage to him so that the labour or service provided by him ceases to be 'forced labour' and the breach of Art. 23 is remedied. This principle was followed to set aside a letter of appointment issued to a part time lecturer because the payment of remuneration of Rs. 500 per month to the lecturer was so meagre as to be violative of Article 2317. In Sanjit Roy v. State of Rajasthan, 18 payment by the State of wages lower than the minimum wages to persons employed on famine relief work was held invalid under Art. 23. Because of famine conditions in the country side, the Public Works Department of the State of Rajasthan started a road building project as a famine relief measure and a large number of workers were employed on this project. As it transpired, the State was paying to these workers less than the minimum wage fixed for unskilled workers in the State. The State claimed that this was authorised by the Rajasthan Famine Relief Works Employees (Exemption from Labour Laws) Act, 1964. The State thus argued that because of the Exemption Act, the Minimum Wages Act was not applicable to employees engaged on a famine relief work. Rejecting the arguments, the Supreme Court ruled that even those persons who are employed on famine Page 3 relief work should be paid the legal minimum wages and not less than that as that would be invalid under Art. 23. In the words of Bhagwati, J.: \"[w]here a person provides labour or service to another for remuneration which is less than the minimum wage, the labour or service provided by him clearly falls within the meaning of the words 'forced labour' and attracts the condemnation of Article 23.\" Whenever any labour or service is taken by the State from any person, whether he is affected by drought and scarcity conditions or not, the State must pay, at the least, minimum wage to him on pain of violation of Art. 23. The State had argued in Sanjit Roy that what it was doing was to provide relief to the persons affected by drought and famine, and that its potential to help people would be very much reduced, and it would not be able to render help to maximum number of sufferers, if it were to give minimum wages to the workers. The Court rejected the contention saying that though the plea of the State might seem 'plausible' but it was 'unsustainable'. Bhagwati, J., argued that though the State undertakes famine relief work to provide relief to suffering people, nonetheless, the work done by them enures for the benefit of the State representing the society. When the affected persons provide labour or service for carrying out such work, there is no reason why the State should pay anything less than the minimum wage to such persons.",

    "content": "the affected persons provide labour or service for carrying out such work, there is no reason why the State should pay anything less than the minimum wage to such persons. The State is not giving dole or bounty to the affected persons, the work done by them is not worthless or useless to the society as to do so would be sheer waste of human labour and resources which could be usefully diverted to fruitful and productive channels leading to community welfare and creation of national wealth or asset. Therefore, if persons are employed in doing useful work, there can be no justification for the State not to pay them minimum wage. Bhagwati, J., observed on this point as follows: \"The State cannot be permitted to take advantage of the helpless condition of the affected persons and extract labour or service from them on payment of less than the minimum wage. No work of utility and value can be allowed to be constructed on the blood and sweat of persons who are reduced to a State of helplessness on account of drought and scarcity conditions. The State cannot under the guise of helping these affected persons extract work of utility and value from them without paying them the minimum wage. Whenever any labour or service is taken by the State from any person, whether he be affected by drought or scarcity conditions or not, the State must pay, at the least, minimum wage to such person on pain of violation of Art. 23 and the Exemption Actinsofar as it excludes the applicability of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 to workmen employed on famine relief work and permits payment of less than the minimum wage to such workmen, must be held to be invalid as offending the provisions of Art. 23.\" The expression 'forced labour' in Art. 23 is of the 'widest amplitude' and on its true interpretation, it covers every possible form of forced labour, begar or otherwise, and it makes no difference whether the person forced to give his labour or service to another is remunerated or not. Bhagwati, J., insisted, after referring to his ruling in ASIAD, that every person providing labour or service to another is entitled at least to the minimum wage; if less than the minimum wage is paid to him then Art. 23 is infringed. Bhagwati, J., emphasized that Art. 23 \"is intended to eradicate the pernicious practice of 'forced labour' and to wipe it out altogether from the national scene.\" Therefore, the Exemption Act which warranted payment of less than minimum wages on famine relief work was held to be unconstitutional. The Court therefore directed the State to pay to those workers the minimum wage and also to pay them the difference between the minimum wage and the actual wage paid for the past service. The Supreme Court in Asiad has taken a very broad view of the term \"forced labour\". It does not only mean when a person is forced to do labour for less than the minimum wages, it also means labour which a person is forced to do even though he is being paid his remuneration. It is the element of 'force' which makes labour as \"forced labour\". Commenting on the ruling in Asiad, the Supreme Court, has observed (per Wadhwa, J.,) in State of Gujarat v. Hon'ble High Court of Gujarat :19 \"It is thus clear that this Court in unmistakable terms has said that every form of forced labour, begar or otherwise is within the inhibition of Article 23 and it makes no difference whether the person who is forced to give his labour or service to another is remunerated or not. Even if remuneration is paid, labour supplied by a person would be hit by this Article if it is forced labour, i.e., labour supplied not willingly but as a result of force or compulsion.\" Page 4 Wadhwa, J., has observed further:20 \"Thus, this Court has held that under Article 23 no one shall be forced to provide labour or service against his will even though it be under a contract of service. Payment of full wages when labour exacted is forced will attract the prohibition contained in Article 23.\" In Rohit Vasavada v. Gen. Man., IFFCO, 21 the pitiable conditions of contract labour working in a fertiliser factory run by a cooperative society were brought to the notice of the Gujarat High Court. The workers had to handle urea manually without adequate safeguards; they were not free to leave the premises as they desired; their health was in jeopardy and proper wages were not being paid to them. The High Court characterised this form of labour as forced labour prohibited by Art. 23. Considering the problems of contract labour employed in the fertilizer factory, the Gujarat High Court stated that economic compulsions may persuade workmen to work under conditions different from those envisaged in the labour laws and the mere fact that they are working, not under any apparent physical restraint, does not render the work voluntary. The Court said that when due to economic compulsions, workmen are forced to work under inhuman or subhuman conditions, without the safeguards, facilities and amenities secured to them under the law being made available to them, irrespective of wages paid to them and their apparent consent, the labour employed will be forced labour contrary to Art. 23. The High Court gave necessary directions to the labour commissioner to take steps to remedy the situation and to enforce the provisions of the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970. A more conservative view was adopted in 2006 by the Supreme Court in Umadevi's case. The argument that Article 23 of the Constitution is breached because the employment on daily wages amounts to forced labour, was not accepted on the ground that \"the employees accepted the employment at [on] their own volition and with eyes open as to the nature of their employment\".",

The argument that Article 23 of the Constitution is breached because the employment on daily wages amounts to forced labour, was not accepted on the ground that \"the employees accepted the employment at [on] their own volition and with eyes open as to the nature of their employment\". Nevertheless the court ensured that the minimum wages were being paid to the daily wagers22. The shift from the earlier liberalism is also reflected in State of Karnataka v. Ameerbi23 where Anganwadi workers appointed under a Central Government funded scheme known as Integrated Child Development Service Programme were held not to be entitled to claim a minimum wage, living wage or fair wage.24 Non-observance of the Equal Remuneration Act, 1976, by government contractors raises questions under Art. 14.25The Act has been enacted in pursuance of Art. 39, a Directive Principle.26 The Act provides for payment of equal remuneration to men and women workers for the same work, or work of a similar nature and for the prevention of discrimination on grounds of sex. The Act also ensures that there will be no discrimination against recruitment of women and provides for setting up of advisory committees to promote employment opportunities for women. Provision is made for appointment of officers for hearing and deciding complaints regarding contravention of the provisions of the Act. Inspectors are to be appointed for the purpose of investigating whether the provisions of the Act are being complied with by employers. The government cannot ignore violation of equality by its own contractors. If any contractor is committing a breach of the Act and thus denying equality before law to the workmen, the government is under an obligation to ensure that the contractor observes the Act and does not breach the equality clause. In Labourers Working on Salal Hydro-Project v. State of Jammu & Kashmir, 27 the Supreme Court found that the workmen employed on the project were being denied the rights and benefits ensured to the workmen under various labour laws. For example, the provisions of the Inter-State Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1979,28were not being implemented at all and violations of the Minimum Wages Act and the Contract Labour Act were also taking place. The Court directed the Central Government to ensure that the contractors at the project implemented the various labour laws. The Court also directed the Central Government to identify the inter-State workers at the project site and ensure to them the benefits of the Inter-State Migrant Workmen Act. Page 5 Similarly, in Ram Kumar v. State of Bihar, 29 the Court directed the State to pay minimum wages to the employees at the ferries at Bhagalpur and Sultanganj which fell under the purview of the Act. As stated above, Art. 23 operates not only against the government but even against private parties.30 Bhagwati, J., emphasized in Asiad that whenever any Fundamental Right which is enforceable against private individuals, such as, Art. 17, 23 or 24, is being violated, the State is under a constitutional obligation to take necessary steps so as to interdict such violation and ensure that the Fundamental Right is observed by the private individual who is transgressing the same. The person whose Fundamental Right is violated can always approach the court for enforcement of his Fundamental Right. But that does not absolve the State from its constitutional obligation to see that the Fundamental Right of such person is not violated, \"particularly when he belongs to the weaker section of humanity and is unable to wage a legal battle against a strong and powerful opponent who is exploiting him\". Thus, in Asiad, the Supreme Court ordered the concerned authorities--Central Government and the Delhi Development Authority--responsible for the construction of various Asiad projects--to ensure that workers got minimum wages and other labour welfare measures were not flouted to the detriment of the workers. The authorities were required to ensure observance of the various labour laws, e.g., the Contract Labour Act, the Minimum Wages Act, the Equal Remuneration Act, the Employment of ChildrenAct and the Inter-State Migrant Workmen Act.31 (d) HARD LABOUR BY PRISONERS The Kerala High Court has declared that the prisoners are entitled to payment of reasonable wages for the work taken from them.32 The right not to be exploited in contravention of Art. 23(1) is a right guaranteed to a citizen and there is no reason why a prisoner should lose his right to receive wages for his labour. The court directed the State to pay Rs. 8 per day as wages to prisoners for their work instead of the prevailing rate of Rs. 1.60 per day. In State of Gujarat v. Hon'ble High Court of Gujarat, 33 the Supreme Court has considered the question: can prisoners be made to do hard labour against their will? Is it hit by Art. 23? Should the prisoners who are required to do labour as part of their punishment, necessarily be paid wages? The Court has ruled that a prisoner sentenced to rigorous imprisonment can be made to do hard labour. But, even then, he should be paid equitable wages for his work. No prisoner can be made to do labour free of wages. \"It is not only a legal right of a workman to have wages for the work, it is a social imperative and an ethical compulsion. Extracting somebody's work without giving him anything in return is only reminiscent of the period of slavery and the system of Begar.\"34 Accordingly, the Court has directed each State Government to appoint a wage-fixing body to determine the quantum of equitable wages payable to the prisoners. Pursuant to this direction some States set up committees which revised wages payable to prisoners. Such revision has also been tested by courts against the principles underlying Art. 23 as enunciated by the Supreme Court.35 B.

    "content": "to this direction some States set up committees which revised wages payable to prisoners. Such revision has also been tested by courts against the principles underlying Art. 23 as enunciated by the Supreme Court.35 B. BONDED LABOUR A serious socio-economic problem in India has been that of bonded labour. Under the bonded system, one person is bonded to provide labour to another for years and years until a debt is supposed to be wiped out. The bonded system is designed to enable a few socially and economically powerful persons to exploit the weaker sections of the people. The system is a relic of the feudal hierarchical society. The Supreme Court has ruled that bonded labour is unconstitutional under Art. 23 as it can be regarded as a form of forced labour. To give effect to Art. 23, Parliament has enacted the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976. This Act Page 6 strikes at the system of bonded labour. In spite of the constitutional and legal provisions abolishing bonded labour, the implementation of the law has been very tardy at the administrative level as all kinds of vested interests make themselves felt in this area. There are many difficult problems involved in eradicating such labour, e.g., problem of identifying bonded labour, problem of rehabilitation after release from the bondage, etc. A big problem in India is that even when beneficent laws are passed by the legislature in the interest of the poor, there remains administrative resistance and inertia in implementing such laws. The courts have however shown a welcome tendency to monitor implementation of such laws, prod the Administration to effectively implement such laws and supervise the implementation process. (a)BANDHUA MUKTI MORCHA The slow implementation of the law banning bonded labour has given rise to several judicial pronouncements by way of public interest litigation. In Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India, 36 in an action brought in the Supreme Court by an organisation dedicated to the cause of release of bonded labourers, the Supreme Court has characterized the system of bonded labour under which one person is bonded to provide labour to another for years and years until an alleged debt is supposed to be wiped out which never seems to happen during the life time of the bonded labourer as \"totally incompatible with the new egalitarian socio-economic order which we have promised to build and it is not only an affront to basic human dignity but also constitutes gross and revolting violation of constitutional values.\" The Court has linked Arts. 23 and 21 in the context of the bonded labour and observed: \"It is the Fundamental Right of every one in this country, assured under the interpretation given to Art. 21... to live with human dignity, free from exploitation.\"37 Where legislation has already been enacted investing the right of the workmen to live with human dignity, with concrete reality and content, \"the State can certainly be obligated to ensure observance of such legislation for inaction on the part of the State in securing implementation of such legislation would amount to denial of the right to live with human dignity enshrined in Art. 21.\"38 Bhagwati, J., speaking on behalf of the Supreme Court, has picturesquely characterised the process of identification and release of bonded labours \"as a process of discovery and transformation of non-beings into human beings\". Bhagwati, J., has emphasized that this is a \"constitutional imperative\" that \"the bonded labourers must be identified and released from the shackles of bondage so that they can assimilate themselves in the main-stream of civilized human society and realise the dignity, beauty and worth of human existence.\" The factual setting in which the Bandhua Mukti Morcha case arose was as follows: A large number of labourers were working in stone quarries in the State of Haryana under in- human and pathetic conditions; no medical aid was provided to them, no safety rules were observed and they lived in sketchy torn huts without roofs; the State authorities were not properly enforcing the relevant laws. The Supreme Court ordered release of these persons from bondage. The Court also emphasized upon the importance of rehabilitaton of the released bonded labourers otherwise their condition would be much worse than before. In the instant case, the Court directed the State Government \"to draw up a scheme or programme for a better and more meaningful rehabilitation of the freed labourers.\" The Court also took cognisance of certain complaints of the workmen at stone quarries, e.g., non-provision of pure drinking water, non-provision of conservancy facilities, absence of medical facilities, etc. The Court gave due directions to remove these complaints and provide the necessary facilities to the workmen. (b) NEERAJA CHOUDHARY Page 7 On the question of identifying bonded labour, the Supreme Court has said in Neeraja Choudhary v. State of Madhya Pradesh :39 \"Whenever it is found that any workman is forced to provide labour for no remuneration or nominal remuneration, the presumption would be that he is a bonded labourer unless the employer or the State Government is in a position to prove otherwise by rebutting such presumption.\"40 The Court has insisted not only on the release of the bonded labourers, but has also laid stress on their proper rehabilitation. The question of rehabilitation of bonded labourers after their release from bondage is of crucial importance, for, otherwise, these labourers will again relapse into bondage if not properly rehabilitated. The Court has squarely placed the whole responsibility on the State. Official apathy towards rehabilitation of labourers after release from bondage was visibly demonstrated in Neeraja Chowdhury. 135 bonded labourers were released from bondage in stone quarries under an order of the Supreme Court in Bandhua Mukti Morcha.41 They were not properly rehabilitated and their sad plight after release from bondage was brought to the notice of the Supreme Court by Neeraja Chowdhary, the Civil rights correspondent of the Statesman Daily.",

    "content": "apathy towards rehabilitation of labourers after release from bondage was visibly demonstrated in Neeraja Chowdhury. 135 bonded labourers were released from bondage in stone quarries under an order of the Supreme Court in Bandhua Mukti Morcha.41 They were not properly rehabilitated and their sad plight after release from bondage was brought to the notice of the Supreme Court by Neeraja Chowdhary, the Civil rights correspondent of the Statesman Daily. It was claimed that it was the obligation of the State Government to provide rehabilitation assistance to these hapless people. The Court squarely placed the responsibility on the State Government and directed it to provide rehabilitation assistance to these people within a month with the following observation: \"Poverty and destitution are almost perennial features of Indian rural life for large numbers of unfortunate, ill-starred humans in this country and it would be nothing short of cruelty and heartlessness to identify and release bonded labourers merely to throw them at the mercy of the existing social and economic system which denies to them even the basic necessities of life such as food, shelter and clothing.... It is therefore imperative that neither the Government nor the Court should be content with merely securing identification and release of bonded labourers but every effort must be made by them to see that the freed bonded labourers are properly and suitably rehabilitated after identification and release\". The Court has emphasized that it is the \"plainest requirement of Arts. 21 and 23 of the Constitution that bonded labourers must be identified and released and, on release, they must be suitably rehabilitated.\" The Court has emphasized that any failure on the part of the government in implementing the provisions of the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act would be the clearest violation of Art. 21 and Art. 23. The Court has further emphasized that this Act was enacted by Parliament pursuant to the Directive Principles of State Policy with a view to ensuring basic human dignity to the bonded labourers.42 In 1997, the Court asked the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to take over the monitoring of the implementation of the directions of Court and that of the provisions of the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976. Further directions were issued in 2004 on the issue of rehabilitation. The Court acknowledged the role played by non-governmental organizations and suggested that their services should be utilized for rehabilitating released bonded labourers.43 C. PROSTITUTES The expression \"traffic in human beings\" used in Art. 23(1),44 commonly known as slavery, implies the buying and selling of human beings as if they are chattels, and such a practice is abolished by Art. 23(1). But the expression is a very wide one and includes the prohibition of traffic in women for immoral purposes. Parliament has enacted the Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Girls Act, 1956 (SITA), with the object of inhibiting or abolishing the immoral traffic in women and girls. The Act is now known as the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956. The Act aims at suppressing the evils of prostitution in women and girls and achieving a public purpose, viz., to rescue the fallen women and girls to stamp out the evils of prostitution and also to provide an opportunity to these fallen victims so that they could become decent members of the society. Page 8 In spite of this Actand other legal provisions found in the Indian Penal Code, the evil of prostitution still prevails. This malady is not only a social but also a socio-economic problem. The malady can be eradicated only if the law enforcing authorities take a very severe and speedy action against all erring persons. Accordingly, inVishal Jeet v. Union of India, 45 the Supreme Court has directed the State Governments to instruct their law enforcing authorities to take action under the law to eradicate child prostitution. The question of rehabilitation of prostitutes and their children was again brought before the Supreme Court in Gaurav Jain v. Union of India46 through a public interest litigation under Art. 32.47 A two Judge Bench took cognisance of the matter. The Court issued several directions relating to the rehabilitation of the children of the prostitutes, child prostitutes and establishment of juvenile homes for them. D. CHILD-LABOUR ABOLISHED A critical human and economic problem is that of child labour. Poor parents seek to augment their meagre income through employment of their children. Employers of children also stand to gain financially. It is realised that a total ban on child labour may not be socially feasible in the socio-economic environment of the country. Accordingly, Art. 24 puts only a partial restriction on employment of child labour. Article 24 prohibits the employment of a child below the age of fourteen years to work in any factory or mine, or in any other hazardous employment. The Supreme Court has emphasized in Asiad48 that Art. 24 embodies a Fundamental Right \"which is plainly and indubitably enforceable against every one.\" By reason of the compulsive mandate in Art. 24, no one can employ a child below the age of 14 years in a hazardous employment like construction work. The contractors are thus under a constitutional mandate not to employ any child below 14 years on construction work. It is also the duty of the Union Government, State Governments and other government bodies to ensure that the contractors to whom they have entrusted construction work also obey this obligation. The Court has reiterated this ruling in Labourers Working on Salal Hydro-Project v. State of Jammu and Kashmir :49 Construction work being hazardous employment, children below 14 cannot be employed on any such work because of the constitutional prohibition contained in Art. 24. The Court has directed the Central Government to enforce this prohibition. It has generally told the Government to persuade the workmen to send their children to school and provide for free education there.",

    "content": "The Court has directed the Central Government to enforce this prohibition. It has generally told the Government to persuade the workmen to send their children to school and provide for free education there. The Court realizes that in the prevailing socio-economic development of the country, prohibition of child labour completely would not be acceptable to large masses of the people because of their poverty. Thus, the Court has observed: \"We are aware that the problem of child labour is a difficult problem... The possibility of augmenting their meagre earnings through employment of children is very often the reason why parents do not send their children to schools and there are large drop-outs from the schools. This is an economic problem and it cannot be solved merely by legislation. So long as there is poverty and destitution in this country, it will be difficult to eradicate child labour. But even so an attempt has to be made to reduce, if not eliminate, the incidence of child labour.\"50 The question of employment of child labour has been brought to the attention of the Supreme Court in several cases by way of public interest litigation. In M.C. Mehta v. State of Tamil Nadu, 51 the Court has considered the constitutional perspectives of the abolition of the child labour in the notorious Sivakasi Match industries. The Court has issued detailed directions to eradicate the practice of employing children below the age of 14 years in this hazardous industry. The Court has insisted that the employers must comply with the provisions of the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act. The Court has emphasized that abolition of child labour is definitely a matter of great public concern and significance. The Court has again reverted to the same theme in Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India .52 In this case, the question specifically raised was regarding employment of children in the carpet industry in the State of Uttar Pradesh. After referring to Art. 24 and a number of Directive Principles, the Supreme Court has observed: Page 9 \"It would, therefore be incumbent upon the State to provide facilities and opportunities as enjoined under Articles 39(e) and (f) of the Constitution,53 and to prevent exploitation of their childhood due to indigence and vagary. As stated earlier, their employment--either forced or voluntary--is occasioned due to economic necessity; exploitation of their childhood due to poverty, in particular, the poor and the deprived sections of the society, is detrimental to democracy and social stability, unity and integrity of the nation.\" In Unnikrishnan,54 and now in Art. 21-A education upto the age of 14 years has been declared to be a Fundamental Right. Right to health, right to potable water, meaningful right to life--all these rights have been declared to be Fundamental Rights. The child is equally entitled to all these Fundamental Rights.55 India has not ratified the ILO's two major conventions on child labour: the Minimum Age Convention, 197356 and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 199957.The latter prohibits the employment of children altogether. The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986 prohibits the employment of children only in certain occupations and in workshops carrying out certain processes. Although the Abolition of Child Labour Bill, 2006 has been pending in Parliament, in order to give effect to the content of the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, from time to time the number of such occupations and processes have been added to, the last of such amendments being in 2006.58Several statutes expressly prohibit the employment of children below the age of 14 years such as the Apprentice Act, 1961, the Factories Act, 1948 and the Mines Act, 1952. Despite these statutory provisions India continues to host the largest number of child labourers in the world today.59 The number of child labourers in the State of U.P alone who have been identified at different places in the State during the period 1997 to January, 2008 is 78548 of whom 37350 child labourers were found working in hazardous occupations.60 Reading Arts. 15(3), 24 and cls. (e) and (f) of Art. 39, the Supreme Court has emphasized in Lakshmi Kant v. Union of India61 upon the great importance of child welfare in the country. Accordingly, the Court has taken opportunity to lay down guidelines for adoption of Indian children by foreign parents as there is no statutory enactment for the purpose. A large number of Indian children are adopted by foreign parents. There have been complaints that these children are maltreated in foreign lands after adoption. Pointing to Arts. 15(3), 24 and 39(e) and (6), the Court has said: \"The Constitutional provisions reflect the great anxiety of the Constitution makers to protect and safeguard the interests and welfare of children in the country.\" Accordingly, the Court has taken the opportunity to lay down guidelines for adoption of Indian children by foreign parents as there was no statutory enactment for the purpose. The Court has emphasized that the primary purpose of giving the child in adoption must be his own welfare, and, therefore, great care must be exercised in permitting the child to be given in adoption to foreign parents.\"62 1.

INTRODUCTORY India is a pluralistic society and a country of religions. It is inhabited by people of many religions. The framers of the Constitution thus desired to introduce the concept of secularism, meaning state neutrality in matters of religion. They also wanted to confer religious freedom on various religious groups. Religion has been a very volatile subject in India both before and after independence. The Constitution therefore seeks to ensure state neutrality in this area. Religious tolerance and equal treatment of all religious groups are essential parts of secularism. Secularism in India does not mean irreligion. It means respect for all faiths and religions. The state does not identify itself with any particular religion.1 India being a secular state, there is no state or preferred religion as such and all religious groups enjoy the same constitutional protection without any favour or discrimination.2 Articles 25 to 28 of the Indian Constitution confer certain rights relating to freedom of religion not only on citizens but also on all persons in India. These constitutional provisions guarantee religious freedom not only to individuals but also to religious groups. Arts. 25 to 28 seek to protect religion and religious practices from state interference. India has no preferred or state religion, as such; all religions are treated alike and enjoy equal constitutional protection without any favour or discrimination. No specific protection has been accorded to any religious group as such. However, the policy of non-interference with religious freedom has not been taken to the length of allowing a religion to impinge adversely on the secular rights of the citizens, or on the state power to regulate socio-economic matters. The constitutional provisions have raised several problems of interpretation. On the whole, the Supreme Court has interpreted these provisions with a view to promote inter-religious amity, harmony and accord. The court has, on the whole, leaned towards the minority groups and has conceded to them certain rights over and above the majority rights. In the U.S.A., religious freedom is guaranteed by the First Amendment. The government is forbidden to pass a law \"respecting an establishment of religion\" as well as a law \"prohibiting the free exercise of religion.\"3 SECULARISM In Bommai4, a nine-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court referred to the concept of secularism in the Indian context. According to Sawant, J.: \"....religious tolerance and equal treatment of all religious groups and protection of their life and property and of the places of their worship are an essential part of secularism enshrined in our Constitution....\" B.P. Jeevan Reddy, J., observed: \"... while the citizens of this country are free to profess, practise and propagate such religion, faith or belief as they choose, so far as the state is concerned, i.e., from the point of view of the state, the religion, faith or belief of a person is immaterial. To it, all are equal and all are entitled to be treated equally\". The concept of secularism is not merely a passive attitude of religious tolerance. It is also a positive concept of equal treatment of all religions. The concept of secularism was not expressly incorporated in the Constitution at the stage of its making. However, its operation was visible in the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles. The concept of secularism, though not expressly stated in the Constitution, was, nevertheless, deeply embedded in the Page 13 constitutional philosophy. In 1976, through the 42nd Amendment of the Constitution, the concept of secularim was made explicit by amending the Preamble.5 By this Amendment, the word \"secular\" was introduced in the Preamble to the Constitution and, thus, what was hitherto implicit was made explicit. The Constitution does not define the term secular as it is a very elastic term and not capable of any precise definition and so it is best left undefined. A secular state does not extend patronage to any particular religion. The state is neither pro any particular religion nor anti any particular religion. The state maintains neutrality in matters of religion and provides equal protection to all religions subject to regulation of secular parts. The state guarantees to individuals and corporates religious freedom. It deals with an individual as a citizen irrespective of his faith and religious belief. The state neither promotes nor prefers any one specific religion. For successful functioning of a democratic system, the concept of a secular state is very essential. There can be no democracy if anti-secular forces are allowed to have play as they will divide followers of different religious faiths who will then be fighting with each other. Therefore, the Constitution leaves the purely religious matters to the individual and permits the state to take charge of the secular matters. Verma, J., delivering the majority opinion in M. Ismail Faruqui v. Union of India, 6 observed in relation to the concept of secularism: \"It is clear from the Constitutional scheme that it guarantees equality in the matter of religion to all individuals and groups irrespective of their faith emphasizing that there is no religion of the state itself. The Preamble of the Constitution read in particular with Articles 25 to 28 emphasizes this aspect and indicates that it is in this manner the concept of secularism embodied in the constitutional scheme as a creed adopted by the Indian people has to be understood while examining the constitutional validity of any legislation on the touchstone of the Constitution. The concept of secularism is one facet of the right to equality woven as the central golden thread in the fabric depicting the pattern of the scheme in our Constitution.\" Reference may be made in this connection to Arts. 25- 28, 29- 30,7 to Arts. 14, 15 and 168 as well as to Arts.",

    "content": "concept of secularism is one facet of the right to equality woven as the central golden thread in the fabric depicting the pattern of the scheme in our Constitution.\" Reference may be made in this connection to Arts. 25- 28, 29- 30,7 to Arts. 14, 15 and 168 as well as to Arts. 44 and 51A.9 These various constitutional provisions promote the idea of secularism and by implication prohibit the establishment of a theocratic state. The state is under an obligation to accord equal treatment to all religions and religious sects and denominations. To underline the great significance of secularism, in Bommai,10 the Supreme Court declared it as the \"basic\" feature of the Constitution. \"Any step inconsistent with the constitutional policy is, in plain words, unconstitutional\".11 And, further, the Supreme Court has gone to the extent of ruling that any State Government which pursues unsecular policies or unsecular course of action acts contrary to the constitutional mandate and renders itself amenable to action under Art. 356.12 The teaching of Sanskrit language as an elective subject is not against the concept of secularism.13 The concept of secularism is not static; it is elastic in connotation. In this area, flexibility is most desirable as there cannot be any fixed views on this concept for all time to come. The courts decide from time to time the contours of the concept of secularism and enforce it in practice. In Aruna Roy v. Union of India14 the Supreme Court has ruled that the concept of secularism is not endangered if the basic tenets of all religions all over the world are studied and learnt. Value-based education will help the nation to fight against fanaticism; ill-will, violence, dishonesty and corruption. These values can be inculcated if the basic tenets of all religions are learnt. Recently, the Supreme Court upheld an order of the Additional District Magistrate, Dakshina Kannada restraining Dr. Thogadia from entering the district and from participating in any function in the district for a period of 15 days. Pasayet, J. speaking for the court said: [W]henever the authorities concerned in charge of law and order find that a person's speeches or actions are likely to Page 14 trigger communal antagonism and hatred resulting in fissiparous tendencies gaining foothold, undermining and affecting communal harmony, prohibitory orders need necessarily to be passed, to effectively avert such untoward happenings\".15 B. FREEDOM TO PROFESS OR PRACTICE RELIGION : ART. 25 Article 25(1) guarantees to every person, and not only to the citizens of India, the \"freedom of conscience\" and \"the right freely to profess, practise and propagate religion\". This, however, is subject to public order, health, morality, and other provisions relating to Fundamental Rights. The state is not, however, prevented from making any law regulating or restricting any economic, financial, political or other secular activity which may be associated with religious practice [ Art. 25(2)(a)]; or any law providing for social welfare and reform, or for throwing open of Hindu religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of the Hindus [ Art. 25(2)(b)]. According to Explanation I, wearing and carrying of kirpans by the Sikhs is included in the profession of the Sikh religion. The term 'Hindu' in this Article, according to Explanation II, includes persons professing the Sikh, Jain or Buddhist religion and the reference to Hindu religious institutions is to be construed accordingly.16 It will thus be seen that the rights conferred on persons and religious denominations by Art. 25 are not absolute. Their exercise is subject to maintenance of public order, etc. The religious rights of every person and every religious denomination are subject to public order, etc. There was a long standing dispute between two Muslim sects--Shias and Sunnis. The Sunnis had two graves on Shia property and disputes arose frequently between the two sects as to the performance of their religious rites, practices and observances leading to law and order problems. Accordingly, the Supreme Court ordered shifting of the graves to some other place as it was in the larger interests of the society and for maintaining public order. Religious freedom is subject to public order. The proposal does not destroy any of the Fundamental Rights of the Sunnis.17 The Court reiterated later18 that it had \"ample powers to direct the shifting of any graves in the larger public interest and no bar to such shifting could be spelt out legally, constitutionally or in the name of religion\". However, the Court suspended its order to shift the graves for ten years, and put an alternative scheme into practice as an experimental measure. Similarly the Madras High Court has held that by directing relocation of a temple, the rights guaranteed under Article 25 and 26 are not infringed19. (a) WHAT IS RELIGION The term 'religion' has not been defined in the Constitution, and it is a term which is not susceptible of any precise definition. The Supreme Court has however given this term an expansive content. The Supreme Court has observed in Lakshmindra:20 \"Religion is certainly a matter of faith with individuals or communities and it is not necessarily theistic. There are well known religions in India like Budhism and Jainism which do not believe in God or in any Intelligent First Cause.\" The guarantee under Art. 25, subject to the exceptions mentioned, confers a Fundamental Right on every person not merely-- (i) to entertain such religious beliefs as are allowed to him by his judgment or conscience, but also (ii) to exhibit his beliefs and ideas in such overt or outward acts and practices as are sanctioned or enjoined by his religion, and further (iii) to propagate and disseminate his religious beliefs, ideas and views for the benefit and edification of others. Page 15 As the Supreme Court has observed:21 \" 'Religion is the belief which binds spiritual nature of men to super-natural being'. It includes worship, belief, faith, devotion, etc. and extends to rituals.",

    "content": "15 As the Supreme Court has observed:21 \" 'Religion is the belief which binds spiritual nature of men to super-natural being'. It includes worship, belief, faith, devotion, etc. and extends to rituals. Religious right is the right of a person believing in a particular faith to practice it, preach it and profess it.\" Religion is a matter of faith. A religion, undoubtedly, has its basis in a system of beliefs and doctrines which are regarded by those who profess that religion as conducive to their spiritual well-being, but it is also something more than merely doctrine or belief. A religion may not only lay down a code of ethical rules for its followers to accept, but may also prescribe rituals and observances, ceremonies and modes of worship which are regarded as an integral part of that religion. These forms and observances might extend even to matters of food and dress. Therefore, the constitutional guarantee regarding freedom of religion contained in Art. 25(1) extends even to rites and ceremonies associated with a religion. The Supreme Court has stated in Lakshmindra: \"The guarantee under the Constitution of India, not only protects the freedom of religious opinion, but it protects also acts done in pursuance of religion\". Religious practices are reflective of matters concerning religion and if religion is to be venerated, then the practices annexed thereto are equally respectable and have to be complied with. Explaining the scope of Art. 25, the Supreme Court has observed in SriLakshamana:22 \" Article 25, as its language amplifies, assures to every person subject to public order, health and morality, freedom not only to entertain his religious beliefs, as may be approved of by his judgment and conscience, but also to exhibit his belief in such outwardly act as he thinks proper and to propagate or disseminate his ideas for the edification of others.\" As has been stated by the Supreme Court,... \"the protection under Arts. 25 and 26 extends a guarantee for rituals and observances, ceremonies and modes of worship which are integral parts of religion and as to what really constitutes an essential part of religion or religious practice has to be decided by the courts with reference to the doctrine of a particular religion or practices regarded as parts of religion\".23 Therefore arbitrarily withholding of the travel documents resulting in pilgrims being deprived of performance of Haj has been held to be violative of Articles 2524. In Gulam Abbas v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 25 in a writ petition under Art. 32, the Supreme Court enforced the customary religious rights of the Shia community on a piece of land. The Court said that the State could not interfere with the established customary rights to perform their religious ceremonies and functions. In order, however, that a practice should be treated as a part of a religion, it is necessary that it be regarded by the said religion as its essential and integral part. This caution is necessary otherwise even purely secular practices, not essential to religion, will be clothed with religious sanction and may claim to be treated as religious practices within the meaning of Art. 25. It means that purely secular practices which may not be an essential and integral part of a religion are not protected and can be abrogated by legislation subject to other Fundamental Rights. Certain practices, even though regarded as religious, may have sprung from merely superstitious beliefs and may, in that sense, be only extraneous and unessential accretions to religion itself. Such practices also are not protected and can be abrogated. Therefore, the norm that only such practices as are essential and integral part of a religion need to be protected. It, therefore, falls upon the courts to decide, on the basis of evidence adduced before them concerning the conscience of the community and the tenets of the religion concerned, whether a practice for which protection is claimed is 'religious' in character, and, if so, whether it is an essential and integral part of the said religion, or is merely 'secular' or 'superstitious' in nature.26 As the Supreme Court has observed in the case noted below:27 \"What constitutes an essential part of a religion or religious practice has to be decided by the courts with reference to the doctrine of a particular religion and include practices which are regarded by the community as a part of its religion\". Page 16 The judicial role in this area has been described by the Supreme Court as follows: \"The Court, therefore, while interpreting Articles 25 and 26 strikes a careful balance between the freedom of the individual or the group in regard to religion, matters of religion, religious belief, faith or worship, religious practice or custom which are essential and integral part and those which are not essential and integral and the need for the State to regulate or control in the interest of the community.\"28 As early as 1963, the Supreme Court observed in this connection:29 \"In deciding the question as to whether a given religious practice is an integral part of the religion or not the test always would be whether it is regarded as such by the community following the religion or not. This question will always have to be decided by the Court and in doing so, the Court may have to enquire whether the practice in question is religious in character and if it is, whether it can be regarded as an integral or essential part of the religion and the finding of the court on such an issue will always depend upon the evidence adduced before it as to the conscience of the community and the tenets of its religion.\" It is very interesting to find the courts delving into scriptures to ascertain the status of a practice in question. The decisions of the Supreme Court and High Courts are replete with such discussion.",

    "content": "decisions of the Supreme Court and High Courts are replete with such discussion. Thus, in State of Rajasthan v. Sajjanlal .30 the Supreme Court delved into Jain religious tenets as regards the management of Jain religious endowments. In E.R.J. Swami v. State of Tamil Nadu, 31 the Supreme Court held, after surveying the Hindu religious tenets, that the mode of appointment of archakas in temples was a secular, and not a religious, practice but the 'denomination, sect or group' of the archakas appointed must be the same as that of the temple in question as prescribed by the agams (treatises of ceremonial law) governing these temples. Therefore, a law abolishing the hereditary principle of appointing the archakas, and laying down that only such persons should be appointed archakas as are duly qualified, has been held to be valid. The Supreme Court has upheld appointment of a non-brahmin to perform puja and other religious rites in a Siva temple. The person concerned should be one who is well versed in performing all the rites and ceremonies peculiar to the temple concerned. \"As long as anyone well versed and properly trained and qualified to perform the pooja in a manner conducive and appropriate to the worship of the particular deity, is appointed as santhikaran dehors his pedigree based on caste, no valid or legally justifiable grievance can be made in a court of law.\"32 Cow sacrifice has been held to be not an obligatory overt act for a Muslim to exhibit his religious beliefs and ideas on Bakr Id day.33 According to the Hedaya, it is optional for a Muslim to sacrifice a goat and that for seven goats a cow or a camel. \"The very fact of an option seems to run counter to the notion of an obligatory duty.\"34 This ruling has been reiterated by the Supreme Court in State of West Bengal v. Ashutosh Lahiri .35 There is no Fundamental Right of a Muslim to insist on slaughter of a healthy cow on Bakri Idd day. The Court has observed:36 \"....slaughtering of healthy cows on Bakri Idd is not essential or required for religious purpose of Muslims or in other words it is not a part of religious requirement for a Muslim that a cow must be necessarily sacrificed for earning religious merit on Bakri Idd.\" There is no text in the holy Koran prohibiting removal or shifting of graves. The ecclesiastical edict or a right not to disturb an interred corpse is not absolute.37 It has been held by the Madras High Court that the Purdah system is not a part of the Islamic law. Even assuming that the Purdah or Gosha is an essential ingredient of the Muslim religion, it may be regulated in the interest of public order, morality or health and also the other provisions of Part III of the Constitution. Therefore, the Election Commission could prescribe photographs in the electoral rolls of eligible voters including photographs of Muslim Gosha Women.38 A Full Bench of the Punjab & Haryana High Court has recently held that keeping unshorn hair is an essential component of the Sikh religion. Therefore a rule by which admission was denied to male students who had shorn their hair and female students who had plucked their eyebrows was upheld under Art. 25.39 Page 17 A second marriage by a Hindu male in the presence of his first wife does not constitute an integral part of the Hindu religion.40 Performance of shradh and offering of pinda are an integral part of the Hindu religion and religious practices.41 Performance of tandava dance by Anand Margis in procession or public places is not an essential religious rite to be performed by every Anand Margi.42 The right of temple attendants to be given a share of the offerings to the deity in the temple is not a part of religion.43 The religious ceremony ends when the offerings have been made by the devotees. The collection and distribution of these offerings among temple sevaks is purely a secular activity.33 After delving deep into the Hindu religious literature, the Supreme Court has ruled in Narayana that while performance of religious service according to the tenets, customs and usages in a temple is an integral part of the religious faith and belief, the person who performs the service is another matter. The system of hereditary archakas is not an essential and integral part of the Hindu religion. Therefore, appointment of an archakabeing a secular act, the Legislature can abolish the hereditary right to appointment as an archaka and such a law is not violative of Art. 25(1) or 26(b).44 Merely because after appointment, the archaka performs worship cannot be a ground for holding that his appointment is a religious practice. The Representation of the People Act, 1951, makes it a corrupt practice to seek votes in the name of religion. This provision has been held to be not inconsistent with Art. 25. TheSupreme Courthas stated that Art. 25 does not extend to creating hatred amongst groups of people practising different religions. The Act in question only purports to curb the appeal for votes on the ground of religion or propagating religion for creating feeling of enmity or hatred between different classes of citizens of India during the election campaign.45 (b) RELIGIOUS FREEDOM SUBJECT TO THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS A person can exercise his religious freedom so long as it does not come into conflict with the exercise of Fundamental Rights of others. In an earlier case,46 the Supreme Court has observed that \"no rights in an organised society can be absolute. Enjoyment of one's rights must be consistent with the enjoyment of rights also by others. Where in a free play of social forces it is not possible to bring about a voluntary harmony, the state has to step in to set right the imbalance between competing interests\". The Court has further observed that \"a particular Fundamental Right cannot exist in isolation in a water-tight compartment.",

    "content": "Court has further observed that \"a particular Fundamental Right cannot exist in isolation in a water-tight compartment. One Fundamental Right of a person may have to co-exist in harmony with the exercise of another Fundamental Right by others also with reasonable and valid exercise of power by the State in the light of the Directive Principles in the interests of social welfare as a whole\".47 This judicial approach has manifested itself in some cases. According to the Supreme Court in Rev. Stainislaus v. State of Madhya Pradesh, 48 [referring to the word 'propagate' in Art. 25(1)], what Art. 25(1) grants \"is not the right to convert another person to 'one's own religion' but to transmit or spread one's religion by an exposition of its tenets\". Art. 25(1) guarantees \"freedom of conscience\" to every citizen and not to the followers of any one particular religion. That means that there is no Fundamental Right to convert another person to one's own religion because if a person purposely undertakes to convert another person to his religion, as distinguished from his effort to transmit or spread the tenets of his religion, that would impinge on the \"freedom of conscience\" guaranteed to all the citizens in the country alike. It can properly be enjoyed by a person if he exercises his right in a manner commensurate with the like freedom of persons following other religions. \"What is freedom for one, is freedom for others, in equal measure, and there can, therefore, be no such thing as Fundamental Right to convert any person to one's own religion.\" Thus, the Supreme Court upheld as valid under Art. 25(1) an Act prohibiting conversion of a person by force, fraud or allurement.49 The Supreme Court did not consider the legislative history of Art. 25 and did not draw any distinction between conversion by force and conversion by persuasion. Conversion should also cover \"re-conversion\", Page 18 an exercise which is being undertaken in many states by Hindus, accompanied, very often, by violence. The Supreme Courthas ruled that the use of loudspeakers by a particular community at the time of prayers is subject to the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. No religion prescribes or preaches that prayers are to be performed through loudspeakers. Any such practice should not affect the rights of others.50 Similarly, restricting the time of bursting the firecrackers does not in any way violate the religious rights of any person under Art. 2551. A second marriage solemnised under Muslim Law by a Hindu convert infringes the religious rites and personal freedom of the Hindu wife. Such a person can be prosecuted under s. 494 , IPC. The person solemnizing such second marriage cannot seek the protection of Art. 25. The second marriage solemnized by a Hindu during the subsistence of the first marriage is an offence punishable under the penal law. The Supreme Court has observed in Lily Thomas v. Union of India :52 \"Freedom guaranteed under Art. 25 of the Constitution is such freedom which does not encroach upon a similar freedom of the other person.\" (c) JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES In 1986, a two Judge Bench of the Supreme Court ruled in Bijoe Emmanuel v. State of Kerala, 53 that Jehovah's witnesses constitute a religious denomination. Compelling a student belonging to the Jehovah's Witnesses to join in the singing of National Anthem despite his \"genuine, conscientious religious objection\", would contravene the rights guaranteed by Arts. 19(1)(a) and 25(1). The Court has noted that Jehovah's Witnesses wherever they are (England, U.S.A) do not sing the National Anthem, though they show respect to it by standing up whenever it is sung. They truly and conscientiously believe that their religion does not permit the singing of the National Anthem. The Court has said: \"....the question is not whether a particular religious belief or practice appeals to our reason or sentiment but whether the belief is genuinely and conscientiously held as part of the profession or practice of religion. If the belief is genuinely and conscientiously held it attracts the protection of Art. 25 but subject, of course, to the inhibitions contained therein\". The Court referred to a number of foreign judgments to testify to the belief of the Jehovah's Witnesses.54 The Court has thus concluded that it is because of their conscientiously held religious faith that they do not join the singing of the National Anthem. This is protected by Art. 25(1). The Court has also held it a violation of Art. 19(1)(a) to punish a student for not singing the National Anthem. Thus, the negative right, the right to remain silent, has been implied in the freedom of speech guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(a). The Court has also ruled that none of the freedoms guaranteed by Arts. 19(1)(a)to (g)can be curtailed by a mere administrative order not having statutory force. As regards Art. 51-A(a)55 imposing fundamental duties on citizens of India, the Court has said: \"It is true Article 51-A(a) of the Constitution enjoins a duty on every citizen of India \"to abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the National Flag and the National Anthem\". Proper respect is shown to the National Anthem by standing up when the National Anthem is sung. It will not be right to say that disrespect is shown by not joining in the singing.\" It may however be emphasized that the Court's opinion is based on the premise that showing respect to the National Anthem is a duty of an Indian citizen, that the Jehovah's witnesses do show their respect when it is sung and that they have expressed their beliefs all over the world. \"They do not hold their beliefs idly and their conduct is not the outcome of any perversity\". This pronouncement raised a controversy. Fears were expressed that other religious groups would take advantage of the ruling and refuse to participate in the singing of the National Anthem and this would ultimately affect national integrity.",

    "content": "do not hold their beliefs idly and their conduct is not the outcome of any perversity\". This pronouncement raised a controversy. Fears were expressed that other religious groups would take advantage of the ruling and refuse to participate in the singing of the National Anthem and this would ultimately affect national integrity. On December 2, 1986, the Prime Minister declared in the Lok Sabha that the Government would use legal and constitutional means to set right the situation. The Prime Minister said that the Government would not allow the National Anthem and the National Flag \"to be reduced in value or pulled down and destroyed\" as they embody the \"soul and spirit of the nation and hence they are sacred to Page 19 us\". The Central Government then moved a writ petition in the Supreme Court seeking reconsideration of the above decision. The Government sought a declaration from the Court that \"the fundamental duty of every citizen of India to respect National Anthem not only includes the duty to stand respectfully when it is sung but also to sing it\". The fundamental duties of citizens are contained in Art. 51A. It was stated in the writ-petition that the matter involving a question of interpretation of the Constitution should have been decided by a five Judge bench instead of only a two Judge bench.56 The application was dismissed albeit on a technical ground.57 It may also be pointed out that the Kerala High Court had earlier taken a view different from that of the Supreme Court. The High Could had ruled that singing of the National Anthem in the school did not contravene religious freedom of Jehovah's Witnesses as they did not constitute a denomination.58 (d) REGULATION OF SECULAR ACTIVITIES: ART. 25(2)(a) The state is empowered to regulate secular activities associated with religious practices. The state is not entitled to regulate religious practices as such. What the state can regulate under Art. 25(2)(a) are the activities which are really of an economic, commercial or political character though these may be associated with religious practices.59 A question would, however, arise whether the activity sought to be regulated is 'religious' or 'secular'. This distinction is important for what is religious cannot be regulated. This again raises the question whether the activity sought to be regulated is regarded as an essential and integral part of the religion in question. If so, it is religious in nature. Management of property attached to a religious institution or endowment is a secular activity which can be regulated by the State60. In Sardar Sarup Singh v. State of Punjab, 61 the Supreme Court ruled that the administration of the property by a religious denomination is placed on a different footing from the right to manage its own affairs in the matter of religion. The latter is a Fundamental Right which no legislature can take away, whereas the former can be regulated by law. Art. 25(2)(a) contemplates state regulation not of religious practices, as such, but of activities which are economic, commercial or political in character though these may be associated with religious practices. In Tilkayat,62 the Supreme Court again ruled that the right to manage the properties of a temple was a purely secular matter and could not be regarded as a religious practice under Art. 25(1), or as amounting to \"matters of religion\" under Art. 26(b).63 The Supreme Court has summed up the relevant law as follows in Sri Jagannath:64 \"... [A]lthough the state cannot interfere with freedom of a person to profess, practise and propagate his religion, the state, however, can control the secular matters connected with religion. All the activities in or connected with a temple are not religious activities. The management of a temple or maintenance of discipline and order inside the temple can be controlled by the state. If any law is passed for taking over the management of a temple it cannot be struck down as violative of Article 25 or Article 26 of the Constitution. The management of the temple is a secular act...\" Slaughtering of animals is connected with economic activity and law can regulate the same. Earlier, the Supreme Court had upheld a law restricting slaughter of animals (suitable for milch, breeding or agricultural purposes), but permitting slaughter of an animal (other than cow), and a bull over 15 years, for bona fide religious purposes. There was no violation of Art. 25 because of Art. 25(2)(a).65 Subsequently, overruling 5 earlier decisions to the contrary66, a total prohibition of the slaughter of the progeny of cows has been held to be intra vires the Constitution.67 If the tenets of any religious sect of the Hindus prescribe that offerings of food should be given to the idol at particular hours of the day, that periodical ceremonies should be performed in a certain way at certain periods of the year, or that there should be daily recital of the sacred text, or oblations should be offered to the sacred fire, then these are religious practices being regarded as an essential part of the religion, and, as Page 20 such, are beyond state regulation. The mere fact that these activities involve expenditure, or employment of priests and servants, or use of marketable commodities, would not make them secular activities partaking of a commercial or economic character.68 Recently a claim under Art. 25(1) by two students belonging to the Seventh Day Adventist denomination seeking rescheduling of an examination on the ground that in terms of their faith no activity could be undertaken from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays was rejected by the Kerala High Court. It was held that the manner of conducting examinations is a subject of a secular nature and not protected under Article 2569. (e) SOCIAL REFORM AND THROWING OPEN OF TEMPLES: ART. 25(2)(b) Article 25(2) (b) contains the following two ideas: (1) Measures of social reform are permissible and would not be void on the ground of interfering with freedom of religion.",

Thus, the Hindu Marriage Act which introduces the principle of monogamy for the Hindus is undoubtedly a law providing for social welfare and social reform. It is a legislation intended for the benefit of the class of persons to whom the Act applies.70 Thus, legislative interference with law of marriage does not constitute an infringement of Hindu religion. Succession like marriage, is a secular matter and is not within the guarantees contained in Art. 25.71 In Krishna Singh v. Mathura Ahir, 72 the Supreme Court has said that Fundamental Rights do not touch upon the personal law of the parties. Art. 25 thus involves a separation between 'religious' activities, on the one hand, and 'secular' and 'social' activities, on the other. While the former are protected the latter are not. The Haryana Legislature disqualified persons having more than two children from holding the position of a sarpanch, up-sarpanch or a panch of a gram panchayat. The provision was challenged on the ground that it violates the personal law of the Mohammedans. The Haryana High Court has upheld the provision on two grounds: (a) Religious freedom is subject to 'health' [ Art. 25(1)]. The provision can be regarded as one for the health of the females. (b) Under Art. 25(2), religious freedom is subject to laws made for social welfare and reform. The provision in question is a measure of social reform. The provision in question does not interfere in professing their religion, practice or propagating the same by the Muslims.73 This view was also expressed by the Supreme Court when it upheld a statutory provision disqualifying persons having more than two children from contesting or holding an elective office, as not violative of Art. 25 of the Constitution.74 (2) The state can throw open Hindu religious institutions of a public character to all sections of the Hindus. Article 25(2) (b) enables the state to take steps to remove the scourge of untouchability from amongst the Hindus. The word \"public\" here includes any section of the public. Public institutions would thus mean not merely temples dedicated to the public as a whole, but even those which are founded for the benefit of sections thereof, and denominational temples would thus fall within the scope of this clause.75 Article 25(2) (b) protects the right to enter into a temple for purposes of worship. This, however, is not an unlimited right. Thus, for instance, no Hindu can claim, as part of the right protected by Art. 25(2)(b), that a temple must be kept open for worship at all hours of the day and night, or that he should personally perform those religious services in a temple which the archakas or pujaris alone are entitled to perform. The courts have recognised the need to place some limitations on the right conferred by Art. 25(2)(b), particularly, with a view to harmonize this right with that protected by Art. 26(b).76 C. FREEDOM TO MANAGE RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS: ART. 26 Page 21 Article 26 gives special protection to religious denominations. Art. 26 lays down that every religious denomination or a section thereof has the right-- (a) to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes; (b) to manage its own affairs in matters of religion; (c) to own and acquire movable and immovable property; and (d) to administer such property in accordance with law. This right is subject to public order, morality and health. (a) RELIGIOUS DENOMINATION While Art. 25 confers the particular rights on all persons, Art. 26 is confined to religious denominations, or any section thereof. Art. 26 thus guarantees collective freedom of religion. The term 'religious denomination' in Art. 26 means a religious sect having a common faith and organisation and designated by a distinctive name. The words \"religious denomination' take their colour from the word 'religion'. Therefore, in case of a denomination, there must be a common faith of the community based on religion, and the community members must have common religious tenets peculiar to themselves.77 To form a religious denomination, three conditions must be fulfilled: (1) It is a collection of individuals who have a system of beliefs which they regard as conducive to their spiritual well-being; (2) They have a common organisation; (3) Collection of these individuals has a distinctive name. After noting this passage as settled law in Nallor Marthandam Vellalar v. Commr., Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments, 78 the Supreme Court went on to say: \"It necessarily follows that the common faith of the community should be based on religion and in that they should have common religious tenets and the basic cord which connects them, should be religion and not merely considerations of caste or community or societal status.\" Whether a particular community constitutes a 'religious denomination' is a mixed question of law and fact.79 The followers of Madhavacharya,80 the Swetambar Sect of Jains81 the followers of the Zoroastrian religion,82 the Gowda Saraswat Brahmins,83 the Dawood Bohras,84 Chishtia Soofies,85 the followers of Vallabha,86 constitute religious denominations. The followers of Ramanuja, known as Shri Vaishnabas, constitute a religious denomination.87 The followers of Sri Aurobindo do not constitute a 'religious denomination'.88 But, Ananda Marga is a religious denomination though not a separate religion89 as they are a collection of individuals who have a system of beliefs with regard to their conducive spiritual well-being, a common organisation and a definitive name. The Supreme Court has ruled that Ramakrishna religion (propounded by Shri Ramakrishna) is not different and distinct from the Hindu religion,90 and so it is not protected by Art. 30(1). But Ramakrishna Math is a religious denomination within Hindu religion and can, thus, claim the Fundamental Rights conferred by Art.",

    "content": "Supreme Court has ruled that Ramakrishna religion (propounded by Shri Ramakrishna) is not different and distinct from the Hindu religion,90 and so it is not protected by Art. 30(1). But Ramakrishna Math is a religious denomination within Hindu religion and can, thus, claim the Fundamental Rights conferred by Art. 26. They thus have a Fundamental Right of establishing and maintaining institutions for a charitable purpose under Art. 26(a) of the Constitution, subject to public order, morality and health as envisaged is that Article itself. Jehovah's witnesses have been held to constitute a religious denomination.91 A math in charge of Sivalli Brahmins who constitute a section of the followers of Madhavacharya falls under Art. 26 as it contemplates not merely a religious denomination but even a section thereof.92 A math of the spiritual fraternity represented by it, can legitimately fall within the purview of Art. 26 which contemplates not merely a religious denomination but even a section thereof. A judicial view has been expressed that the followers of the Hindu religion, as such, even though numerous and divided into many sects and sub-sects, can be regarded as a 'religious denomination', for if it were not Page 22 so, then while an institution belonging to a sect or a sub-sect of Hindus would get the protection of Art. 26, an institution belonging to the Hindus generally would be deprived of that protection. The term denomination can be used in a larger or a narrower sense depending on the context, and, therefore, all the followers of a religion may quite appropriately be regarded as constituting a religious denomination.93 The Swaminarayan Sampradaya has been held to be not a religion distinct and separate from the Hindu religion.94A law enacted by the Bombay Legislature threw open every place of public worship which was open to all sections and classes of Hindus. The Court ruled that as the Swaminarayan Sect was not distinct and separate from the Hindu religion, the temples belong to the sect fell under the ambit of the Act. The Hindu Sections of the Arya Vysya Community who worship Goddess Matha Kanyakaparameswari are not denominational section for the purposes of Arts. 26(1) and 26(d).95 The benefit of Art. 26 is not confined to 'minority' groups only. Sikhs, though in majority in Punjab, constitute a 'religious denomination' and can, thus, claim the benefit of Art. 26.96 An expansive opinion was expressed by an eleven-Judge Bench in T.M.A. Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka,97 in respect of Art. 26(a) when it said: \"The right to establish and maintain educational institutions may also be sourced to Article 26(a), which grants, in positive terms, the right to every religious denomination or any section thereof to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes, subject to public order, morality and health.\" (b) ESTABLISH & MAINTAIN In Art. 26(a), the words 'establish and maintain' go together. It means, therefore, that where an institution has been established by a religious denomination, then it can claim the right to maintain the same as well. The right to 'maintain' an institution includes the right to 'administer' as well. A denomination has no right to maintain an institution which has not been established by it. The words 'establish' and 'maintain' must be read conjunctively. A religious denomination can claim to maintain only those institutions which it has established. Even when a temple is being maintained by a religious denomination, but if it has not established by the same, Art. 26(a) does not apply.1 As the Aligarh Muslim University has been established under a statute, and not by the Muslims as such, they cannot claim the right to maintain the same.2 In this case, the Supreme Court did not finally decide the question whether, in view of Art. 30(1) specifically making a provision with respect to educational institutions,3 colleges will fall within the scope of Art. 26(a) or not. The issue may be taken as having been decided in T.M.A.Pai's case which held religious denominations or sections thereof, which do not fall within the special categories carved out in Articles 29(1) and 30(1), have the right to establish and maintain religious and educational institutions. This would allow members belonging to any religious denomination, including the majority religious community, to set up an educational institution. (c) MATTERS OF RELIGION The term 'matters of religion' used in Art. 26(b) is synonymous with the term 'religion' in Art 25(1).4 It thus includes not only religious beliefs but also such religious practices and rites as are regarded to be an essential and integral part of religion. Art. 26(b) does not extend to purely secular affairs, e.g., administration of denomination's property.5 Ex-communication based on religious grounds, such as, lapse from the orthodox religious creed or doctrine, has been held by a divided Supreme Court to be a part of the management by the community concerned of its own affairs in matters of religion. Accordingly, a statute prohibiting ex-communication on religious grounds has been held to be inconsistent with Art. 25(1) and Art. 26(b), and it is not protected by Art. 25(2)(b) as a matter of social reform, as barring ex-communication on religious grounds pure and simple cannot be Page 23 considered as promoting social welfare and reform. Prohibiting ex-communication on grounds other than religious may, however, be justifiable under Art. 25(2)(b) as a measure of social reform.6 This judicial pronouncement is subject to the criticism that it prefers the denominational right to the individual freedom of conscience guaranteed by Art. 25. The minority view was that the Act was a measure of social reform justified by Art. 25(2)(b). Further, the position of an ex-communicated party is equal to that of an untouchable but Art. 17 abolishes untouchability.7 (d) ARTS. 25(2)(B) AND 26(B) The right of the religious minority under Art. 26(b) is not only subject to \"Public order, morality and health', but also to Art. 25(2)(b), viz., \"providing for social welfare and reform...... The words 'religious institutions of a public character' in Art.",

    "content": "Further, the position of an ex-communicated party is equal to that of an untouchable but Art. 17 abolishes untouchability.7 (d) ARTS. 25(2)(B) AND 26(B) The right of the religious minority under Art. 26(b) is not only subject to \"Public order, morality and health', but also to Art. 25(2)(b), viz., \"providing for social welfare and reform...... The words 'religious institutions of a public character' in Art. 25(2)(b) include an institution belonging to a religious denomination and such an institution can thus be thrown open to all sections of the Hindus under Art. 25(2)(b). On the other hand, the term 'religion' in Art. 26(b) embraces religious practices which signifies that such questions as who are the persons entitled to enter into a temple for worship, where they are entitled to stand and worship, how the worship is to be concluded, are all matters of religion coming within the purview of Art. 26(b). This means that a denomination has a right to exclude persons from participating in the worship according to the tenets of the institution concerned. There thus arises a conflict between these two constitutional provisions. In the interests of harmonizing these provisions, it becomes necessary to read the one subject to the other. The Madras Temple Entry Authorisation Act removed the disability of Harijans from entering into Hindu public temples. The trustees of a temple contended that it was a private temple and so it was outside the scope of the Act. The Supreme Court rejected the plea.8 The Court ruled that the rights of a religious denomination to manage its own affairs in matters of religion under Art. 26(b) were subject to and controlled by a law protected under Art. 25(2)(b). Reading Art. 26(b) subject to Art. 25(2)(b), the Court ruled that a Hindu denomination cannot claim a right to totally exclude other Hindus from worshipping in the temple at all times. But then, reading Art. 25(2)(b) subject to Art. 26(b), a religious denomination may claim a right to exclude strangers from certain religious ceremonies. This denominational right is, however, subject to the condition that, after giving effect to its right, what is left to others by way of right of worship is something substantial and not merely the husk of it. On this basis, the Supreme Court accepted the plea of Gowda Saraswath Brahmins that during certain ceremonies, and on special occasions, only members of their community are entitled to participate to the exclusion of all others. The denominational right has been recognised for what is left to the public of its right under Art. 25(2)(b) is substantial. A Muslim denomination has a right to establish a mosque but a Muslim of any sect and denomination has a right to offer prayer therein. It is a Fundamental Right of every Mahomedan to offer his namaz. He cannot be denied this right on the ground of not belonging to a particular sect or denomination who founded the mosque and were managing it. However, he cannot claim that he should be led in his namaz by an imam belonging to his sect.9 (e) RIGHT TO ACQUIRE AND MANAGE PROPERTY Art. 26(d) Under Art. 26(c), a religious denomination can acquire property;10 under Art. 26(d), it can administer such property according to law. Reading Arts. 26(b) and 26(d) together, it becomes obvious that a distinction has been drawn between the right 'to manage its religious affairs' by a religious denomination and its right 'to manage its property'. In regard to affairs in matters of religion, the right of management given to a religious body is a guaranteed Fundamental Right which cannot be taken away by any law (except for health etc.--the overall condition). On the other hand, as regards administration of property, which a religious denomination is entitled to own and Page 24 acquire, it undoubtedly has the right to administer such property only in accordance with law. While matters of religion are entirely outside the pale of law, it is not so with respect to property which has to be held and enjoyed according to law.11 This means that the State can regulate the administration of trust properties by means of laws validly enacted : but here again under Art. 26(d), it is the religious denomination or general body of religion itself which has the right to administer this property in accordance with any valid law. Any law which takes away the right of administration altogether from the religious denomination and vests it in any other body or a secular authority, would amount to violation of the right which is guaranteed by Art. 26(d). Thus, imposition of land revenue on land belonging to a religious denomination is not hit by Art. 26 when the burden imposed \"is a burden to be shared in the same manner by all the owners of the land in the State and not a special burden imposed on the denominational institution. Burden of that nature is outside the right guaranteed by Art. 26 of the Constitution.\"12 Take-over of the management of the Auroville township for a limited period is not a matter of religion as Auroville is not a place of worship. It is a township dedicated to promote international understanding and world peace. It is a secular and not a religious activity.13 Although under Art. 26(d), the State can regulate administration of property attached to a religious institution, there is, nevertheless, the condition that the right of administration must always vest in the concerned religious denomination itself which shall administer the property according to law. The State can regulate administration of property of a denomination, but cannot divest it of its right to administer the same and vest it in another body. Whatever restrictions and regulations a law might impose on the denominational right to manage its property, the right of management must still be left with the denomination itself.",

Whatever restrictions and regulations a law might impose on the denominational right to manage its property, the right of management must still be left with the denomination itself. A law which takes away the right of administration from the hands of the concerned religious denomination altogether and vest it in any other body violates Art. 26(d). The Supreme Court has explained the position in this regard as follows:14 \"....in regard to affairs in matters of religion, the right of management given to a religious body is a guaranteed Fundamental Right which no legislation can take away. On the other hand, as regards administration of property which a religious denomination is entitled to own and acquire, it has undoubtedly the right to administer such property, but only in accordance with law. This means that the State can regulate the administration of trust properties by means of laws validly enacted: but here again it should be remembered that under Art. 26(d), it is the religious denomination or general body of religion itself which has been given the right to administer its property in accordance with any law which the State may validly impose. A law which takes away the right of administration altogether from the religious denomination and vests it in any other or secular authority, would amount to violation of the right which is guaranteed by Art. 26(d) of the Constitution.\" The Muslim Wakfs Act which lays down that every member of the Wakfs Board is to be a Muslim, is valid as it does not deprive the religious denomination, namely, the Muslims, of its right to administer the wakf property.15 Similarly, vesting of the administration of a Hindu temple in a committee consisting of Hindus only does not contravene Art. 26(d).16 The management of the temple is primarily a secular act.17 A law vesting the administration of the Nathdwara temple properties in Rajasthan in a committee consisting of the members of the denomination concerned, nominated by the government, with the collector as an ex officio member, has been held not to contravene Art. 26(d).18 The constitution of the committee was so designed as to give adequate and fair representation to the denomination on it. As regards the principle of nomination of the members, the Court stated that no other method of constituting the committee was possible as the number of the devotees visiting the temple ran into lakhs and the numbers of the members of the denomination was very large who were not organised into any body which might comprehensively represent them as a class. In State of Rajasthan v. Sajjanlal, 19 the Supreme Court held valid a law vesting management of Jain religious trusts in committees of management subject to the condition that the members of the concerned committee should belong to the same denomination to which the particular trust belonged. The government cannot nominate persons of one denomination to manage trust belonging to another denomination. The Page 25 person authorised to nominate the persons of the Managing Committee need not be part of the denomination.20 If, however, the right to administer the properties never vested in the denomination concerned, or had been validly surrendered by it, or had otherwise been effectively and irretrievably lost by it, then Art. 26(d) could not be invoked by it to claim the right of management of the property concerned. The Durgah at Ajmer belongs to the Chisti Sect of Soofis. The Durgah Khwaja Saheb Act, 1955, which vested administration of property attached to the Durgah in a nominated committee, was challenged on the ground that the committee would include persons other than the Chisti Muslims which was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court found that the management of the property attached to the Durgah had never been in the hands of the Chisti Sect but had always been in the hands of the officers appointed by the State. The Court ruled that Arts. 26(c) and (d) do not create rights in any denomination which it never had; they merely safeguard the continuance of the rights which a denomination already has. If a denomination never had the right to manage the properties endowed in favour of the denominational institution, then the denomination could not be said to have acquired any right as a result of Arts. 26(c) and (d).21 When the properties and management of a jain temple had been taken over by the Ruler of Udaipur, Jains lost their right of managing the temple and they could not regain it by invoking Art. 26(d).22 Art. 26(c) Art. 26(c) guarantees to a religious denomination the right to own and acquire immovable property. This, however, is not an absolute and unqualified right. Art. 26(c) cannot take away the right of the state to compulsorily acquire property. If a religious denomination owns large areas of land and indulges in activities injurious to the interests of agricultural tenants, freedom of religion cannot be pleaded as a shield against regulatory remedial measures adopted by the state to prevent exploitation and unrest among agriculturists in the interests of general social welfare. \"The core of religion is not interfered with in providing for amenities for sufferers of any kind.\"23 The Supreme Court, however, has put the following rider: if acquisition of property of a religious denomination by the state can be proved to be such as to destroy or completely negative its right to own and acquire property for even the survival of a religious institution, the question may have to be examined in a different light. The principle has been applied when the land belonging to a samadhi was acquired. Acquisition was held valid as it did not imperil the survival of the samadhi. What is integral to or a necessary part of the samadhi is a question of fact. Such land could not be acquired compulsorily.",

Such land could not be acquired compulsorily. The State can compulsorily acquire property of a religious denomination insofar as it does not destroy or completely negative its right to own and acquire property for even the survival of the religious institution in question.24 The Gujarat Legislature enacted an Act with a view to abolish inams25held by religious or charitable institutions. No compensation was payable. The Act was placed in the IX Schedule to the Constitution.26 The Gujarat High Court declared the Act to be constitutionally valid in S.B. Narayancharya Public Trust v. State of Gujarat .27 The court ruled that the right conferred by Art. 26(c) is not a part of the basic features or structure28 of the constitution, it is not an absolute and unqualified right to the extent that no agrarian reform can touch upon the lands owned by the religious denomination. The impugned Act fell within the scope of Art. 31A(1)(a)29 and Art. 31B.30 The Act was also protected under Art. 31C.31 (f) ACQUISITION OF A RELIGIOUS PLACE In Dr. M. Ismail Faruqui v. Union of India, 32 the Supreme Court has considered the question of acquisition of a religious place by the State. A temple, church or a mosque, etc. are essentially immovable properties and subject to protection under Arts. 25 and 26. Every immovable property is liable to be acquired. While offer of Page 26 prayer or worship is a religious practice, its offering at every location where such prayers can be offered would not be an essential or integral part of such religious practice unless the place has a particular significance for that religion so as to form an essential or integral part thereof. Places of worship of any religion having particular significance for that religion, to make it an essential or integral part of the religion, stand on a different footing and have to be treated differently and more reverentially. Nevertheless, \"the acquisition of any religious place is to be made only in unusual and extraordinary situations for a larger national purpose keeping in view that such acquisition should not result in extinction of the right to practice that religion, if the significance of that place be such. Subject to this condition, the power of acquisition is available for a mosque like any other place of worship of any religion\". \"The right to worship is not at any and every place, so long as it can be practised effectively, unless the right to worship at a particular place is itself an integral part of that right.\"33 In Gulam Kadar,34 the Gujarat High Court has ruled that the acquisition of a religious place or a part thereof can be acquired in public interest for widening of the road. Arts. 25 and 26 protect religious practices which are essential and integral part of practice of the religion while offer of prayer or worship is a religious practice, its offering at every location where such prayers can be offered would not be an essential or integral part of such religious practice unless the place has a particular significance for that religion so as to form an essential or integral part thereof. Places of worship of any religion having particular significance for that religion to make it an essential or integral part of the religion, stand on a different footing and have to be treated differentially and more reverentially than the other places of worship of that religion. D. RELIGIOUS ENDOWMENTS There has been a spate of legislation to regulate and control the management of religious endowments.35 This legislation has given rise to a number of problems under Arts. 25 and 26, some which may be taken note of here. The basic constitutional position in this respect is this: the right to establish a religious institution or endowment is a part of religious belief or faith, but its administration is a secular matter which can be regulated by an appropriate law made by the legislature. The regulation can only be in respect of the administration of the secular part of the religious institution or endowment, and not of beliefs, tenets, usages and practices, which are an integral part of that religious belief or faith. Also, it is necessary that the regulatory law leaves the right to administer the endowment to the religious denomination concerned.36 The right to establish a religious and charitable institution is a part of religious belief and faith. Though a law made under Art. 25(2) may impose restrictions on the exercise of that right, the right to maintain and administer such institution cannot altogether be taken away and vested in other party; more particularly in the officers of a secular government.37 While Arts. 25 and 26 grant religious freedom to minority religions like Islam, Christianity and Judaism, these Articles do not intend to deny the same guarantee to Hindus. Hindus are in majority in the Indian population and Hinduism is a major religion. Therefore, protection under Arts. 25 and 26 is available to Hindus as well. A law enacted by the Andhra Pradesh Legislature relating to the administration and governance of the Hindu endowments was challenged on the ground that it was discriminatory to enact such a law only for the Hindus without enacting a similar law for endowments belonging to other religious endowments belonging to other religions such as, Muslims, Christians, etc. The Supreme Court rejected the argument. In a pluralistic democratic society governed by rule of law, \"gradual progressive change and order should be brought about.\"38 The general principle followed by the courts is that secular matters pertaining to a religion may be controlled by the Legislature as Arts. 25(1) and 26(b) do not protect secular practices. The management of the property belonging to a temple is not a religious matter under Art.",

    "content": "Supreme Court rejected the argument. In a pluralistic democratic society governed by rule of law, \"gradual progressive change and order should be brought about.\"38 The general principle followed by the courts is that secular matters pertaining to a religion may be controlled by the Legislature as Arts. 25(1) and 26(b) do not protect secular practices. The management of the property belonging to a temple is not a religious matter under Art. 25(1), but is a secular matter which can be controlled by law under Art. 26(d) without its coming into conflict with the rights guaranteed by Arts. 25(1) and 26(a) and (b). The Legislature is thus competent to make a law regulating management of property Page 27 provided that the denominational right of management is not extinguished altogether.39 A legal provision requiring compulsory registration of public religious or charitable trusts is valid as it ensures proper supervision and control over trust property and relates to the administration of trust property as contemplated by Art. 26(d).40 The following legal requirements have also been held valid:-- (i) Imposing a duty on a trustee to keep regular accounts of the trust in the form prescribed, and to have them audited;41 (ii) Requiring the trustee to maintain and prepare registers for religious institutions in the form prescribed and to have them verified every year.42 (iii) Prescribing the securities in which the surplus trust money could be invested.43 (iv) As the immovable trust property is inalienable by its very nature, its alienation (except by way of lease for a specified period), without the sanction of the Charity Commissioner can be validly prohibited by law.44 (v) A law can validly authorise the Charity Commissioner to enter on and inspect public trust property, subject to his giving a reasonable notice to the trustee and his observing the religious practices and usages of the trust. An unregulated and unrestricted right of entry in a public temple or other religious institution cannot be conferred on the Charity Commissioner because an outsider, not connected with the spiritual functions, is not allowed access to the sacred parts of the temple, or at a time when the idol is resting and these customs must be observed.45 A provision authorising the court to appoint the Charity Commissioner as the trustee of a math or a religious institution is invalid as it violates the constitutional guarantee given to religious institutions to manage their religious affairs. This is not purely a secular matter relating to administration of trust property.46 The Commissioner can be authorised to frame a scheme for the administration of the institution subject to the court's ultimate control. But a provision conferring such a power on the Commissioner 'finally and conclusively' without the court's intervention will not be valid.47Similarly, a law can validly provide that the budget of a religious institution should be made under the Commissioner's supervision, as budget is indispensable in all public institutions. The Commissioner cannot, however, alter or modify the budget in a manner, or to an extent, inconsistent with the wishes of the founder of the trust, or with the provisions of the relevant Act.48 What rites and ceremonies are essential according to its religion is, however, a matter which the religious denomination or institution is to decide for itself and no outside authority can interfere with such a decision. As the Supreme Court has emphasized: \"If the tenets of any religious sect of the Hindus prescribe that offerings of food should be given to the idol at particular hours of the day, that periodical ceremonies should be performed.... all these would be regarded as parts of religion and the mere fact that they involve expenditure of money or employment of priests and servants or the use of marketable commodities would not make them secular activities partaking of a commercial or economic character; all of them are religious practices and should be regarded as matters of religion within the meaning of Art. 26(b).\" But the scale of expenses to be incurred in connection with the religious observances is a matter of administration of property belonging to the religious institution and could therefore be controlled by secular authorities in accordance with law, for no religion enjoins destruction of the institution and its endowments by incurring wasteful expenditure on rites and ceremonies.49 The offering of food to the deity in the temple, and the quantity of food offered constitute matters of religion. Therefore, the order of the commissioner reducing the quantity of the offerings contravene Arts. 25 and 26, particularly when the financial position of the temple does not warrant any such reduction.50 A provision empowering the commissioner to pass any order that he may deem necessary to ensure that endowments are properly administered and that their income is duly appropriated for the purposes for which Page 28 they were founded is valid. Some amount of control or supervision over the due administration of the endowments and due appropriation of their funds is necessary in the interest of the public. (a) MAHANT A provision empowering the Commissioner to require a mahant of a math to appoint a manager to administer the secular affairs of the math and in case of default, to appoint the manager himself, is constitutionally invalid. A mahant is a trustee as well as the spiritual head; he also has a personal interest in the trust property. In the concept of a mahant, both the elements of office and property, of duties and personal interest, are blended together. A mahant is entitled to enjoy the property so long as he holds the office.51 No rigid demarcation can be made between the spiritual duties of the mahant and his personal interest in the trust property. Under the provision in question, the mahant could be deprived of his right to administer trust property even if there was no negligence or maladministration on his part. Further, under Art.",

    "content": "the right to manage property is to vest in the denomination itself and as the provision takes away the right of management from the denomination and vests it in a manager, it is invalid.52 The commissioner cannot, however, pass an order interfering with the rights of the mahant sanctioned by usage or lowering his position as the spiritual head of the institution.53 A legal provision providing for the removal of a mahant through a court order on the ground of wasting funds or the property of the math, or using the same for his own personal enjoyment is valid.54 A provision empowering the commissioner to enquire into charges against the mahant and order his removal if such charges are established is valid as the commissioner's power is subject to several safeguards: he acts in a quasi-judicial manner; the order of removal could be challenged in a court and an appeal could be taken to the High Court.55 An Andhra Pradesh law required the Mathadhipathi to maintain regular accounts of the Math. The provision was held valid as maintaining accounts is a secular activity. The Act also authorised the Commissioner to remove a Mathadhipati on his satisfying that one or all of the conditions enumerated in the Act. This provision was held valid. The Mathadhipati would have a right to defend himself against the charges laid against him. The Commissioner has to give a reasoned decision. Being a high ranking officer, he is expected to act \"reasonably, objectively and fairly\", he is not expected to act arbitrarily or at his whim.\"56 The Court has explained that it is the duty of the Mahant to propagate and practice the religious tenets of which he is an adherent. If any legal provision prevents the Mahant from propagating his doctrine, that would certainly affect the religious freedom guaranteed under Art. 25. But the Mathadhipati is also under an obligation to maintain the dignity of his office. He is the trustee of the property of the math in relation to the management of the property of the math and he is answerable as such. (b) DOCTRINE OF CYPRES As regards the application of the doctrine of cypres to religious endowments, the position now appears to have crystallised as follows: The constitutional guarantee to a denomination to manage its own affairs in matters of religion includes the right to spend the trust property, or its income for religious purposes indicated by its founder, or established by usage. It is, therefore, an unwarrantable encroachment on the freedom of religious institutions to manage their religious affairs to divert trust funds to any other purpose when the original objects of the founder of the trust can still be carried out. The state can step in only when the trust fails or becomes incapable of being carried out either wholly or partially.57 The doctrine of cypres can be applied to surplus funds left after meeting the legitimate expenses of the institution.58 It is illegitimate to divert trust funds to other purposes so long as the original objects of the trust can be carried out, but the same considerations would not apply to diversion of surplus funds left after exhausting the purposes of the endowment. Page 29 Another condition in this respect is that if a person is aggrieved by the diversion of surplus funds to other purposes, he should be able to file a suit in a court which should have the power to set aside or modify the order in question. E. NO TAXATION TO PROMOTE A RELIGION To maintain the secular character of the Indian polity, not only does the Constitution guarantee freedom of religion to individuals and groups, but it is also against the general policy of the Constitution that any money be paid out of the public funds for promoting or maintaining any particular religion. Accordingly, Art. 27 lays down that no person \"shall be compelled to pay any taxes, the proceeds of which are specifically appropriated in payment of expenses for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious denomination\". According to T.M.A. Pai:59 \"The manner in which the article has been framed does not prohibit the State from enacting a law to incur expenses for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious denomination, but specifies that by that law, no person can be compelled to pay any tax, the proceeds of which are to be so utilized. In other words, if there is a tax for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious denomination, no person can be compelled to pay any such tax\". This provision, it has been held, does not invalidate levy of a fee to provide some services. Thus, a fee can be levied on pilgrims to a religious fair to meet the expenses of the measures taken to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of the pilgrims.60 Such a legislation is not invalid even under Art. 25(1) which permits legislation for promoting \"health, morality and public order.\"61 Similarly, to meet the expenses of government supervision over the administration of religious endowments, a fee can be levied on them. A State cannot levy a tax for the purpose, as there is no such entry in List II or List III.62 Only Parliament can levy such a tax. The States can only levy a fee. Art. 27 will not hit the 'fee' levied by a State because the object of such a contribution is not to foster or preserve religion, but to control secular administration of religious institutions.63 Requiring Muslim wakfs to contribute to a fund for promotion of education of Muslim students does not violate Art. 27. Making provision for education of students professing a particular religion does not amount to maintaining that religion.64 A grant of money by the State for renovating water tanks belonging to Lord Jagannath was held to be not invalid under Art.",

    "content": "Making provision for education of students professing a particular religion does not amount to maintaining that religion.64 A grant of money by the State for renovating water tanks belonging to Lord Jagannath was held to be not invalid under Art. 27, for these tanks were used by the general public for bathing and drinking purposes, and thus needed to be repaired and maintained in hygienic condition. In the circumstances, the State could not be said to be promoting or maintaining the Hindu religion.65 The Government of India agreed to support a cultural programme for celebrating 2500th Nirvana (Salvation) Anniversary of Lord Mahavir. The Delhi High Court held in Suresh Chandra v. Union of India, 66 that this did not violate Art. 27, as the programme did not promote Jain religion. Art. 27 prohibits favouring of one religion over the other. The Central Government has been consistently honouring the memory of great sons of India impartially and irrespective of the religion to which they belong. 'Religion' is confined to the essential doctrine and the necessary ceremonies associated with it and it does not include activities of a secular or cultural nature. Publication of books containing the life and teachings of Lord Mahavir and the display of his sayings on monuments do not amount to religious instruction or promotion of Jain religion.67 As a result of a communal riot, some Hindu and Muslim places of worship were destroyed. The Government agreed to meet the cost of restoring these places to the pre-riot condition. This was held not to be invalid.68 The High Court said: \"Houses, schools and places of worship belonging to both religious groups, Hindus and Muslims, were damaged and in restoring them to their original condition there is no question of promotion or maintenance of any particular religion....\" The High Court even maintained that even if places of worship belonging to one religious denomination alone were damaged and they alone were to be reconstructed, even then there would be no question of promotion or maintenance of that particular religion. Page 30 F. RESTRICTION ON RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION IN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS According to Art. 28(1), no religious education is to be provided in any educational institution which is wholly maintained out of the state funds. Under Art. 28(2), this restriction would not apply to an educational institution which, though administered by the state, has been established under an 'endowment' or 'trust' requiring that religious instruction should be imparted in such an institution. In state-recognised educational institutions, religious education can be imparted on a voluntary basis. According to Art. 28(3), no person attending an educational institution recognised by the state or receiving aid from the state funds, can be required to participate in any religious instruction imparted in the institution, or to attend any religious worship conducted in the institution, or any premises attached thereto, unless he consents to do so voluntarily or, if a minor, his guardian gives his consent for the same. Art. 28 distinguishes between three types of educational institutions. (a) In institutions of a completely public nature, there is absolute prohibition on religious education. (b) In institutions where the state acts as a trustee, religious instruction is permitted. (c) In State-aided denominational institutions, religious instruction on a voluntary basis is permitted. Art. 28(3) thus supplements Art. 30(1).69 The State of Punjab has established Guru Nanak University with a view inter alia to make provision for study and research on the \"life and teachings of Guru Nanak and their religious and cultural impact in the context of Indian and world civilizations\". This provision was challenged under Art. 28(1) on the ground that the university being wholly maintained out of the State funds would be providing religious instruction. The Supreme Court rejected the challenge in D.A.V. College, Jullundur v. State of Punjab, 70 saying that the provision did not imply that religious instruction would be given. A provision for an academic study of, and research in, the life and teachings or the philosophy and culture of any great saint of India in relation to, or their impact on, the Indian and world civilizations could not be considered as providing for religious instruction. The Court stated that religious instruction is that \"which is imparted for inculcating the tenets, the rituals, the observances, ceremonies and modes of worship of a particular Sect or denomination.\" The trend of the Supreme Court decisions is to confine the concept religion to the essential doctrine and the necessary ceremonies with it and not to extend the concept to secular or cultural or philosophical studies or activities. In Aruna Roy v. Union of India, 71 the Supreme Court has ruled recently that Art. 28 does not ban a study of religions. The whole emphasis of Art. 28 is \"against imparting religious instruction.\" There is no prohibition on \"study of religious philosophy and culture, particularly for having value based social life in a society which is degenerating for power, post or property.\"72 In the words of Dharmadhikari, J. : \"study of religions, therefore, in school education cannot be held to be an attempt against the secular philosophy of the Constitution.\"73 1.

M P Jain Indian Constitutional Law/Volume 2/PART V POLITICAL AND CIVIL RIGHTS/CHAPTER XXX FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS (11) CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS CHAPTER XXX Fundamental Rights (11) Cultural and Educational Rights Articles 29 and 30 protect and guarantee certain cultural and educational rights to various cultural, religious and linguistic minorities located in India. A. PROTECTION OF INTERESTS OF MINORITIES* According to Art. 29(1), any section of the citizens residing in any part of India having a distinct language, script or culture of its own has the right \"to conserve the same\". This constitutional provision, therefore, protects the language, script or culture of a section of the citizens. In order to invoke Art. 29(1), all that is essential is that a section of the citizens, residing in India should have a distinct language, script or culture of its own. If so, they will have the right \"to conserve the same\".",

    "content": "constitutional provision, therefore, protects the language, script or culture of a section of the citizens. In order to invoke Art. 29(1), all that is essential is that a section of the citizens, residing in India should have a distinct language, script or culture of its own. If so, they will have the right \"to conserve the same\". Article 29(1) does not refer to any religion, even though the marginal note of the Art. mentions the interests of minorities.1 According to Art. 29(2), admission is not to be denied to any citizen into any educational institution maintained by the state, or receiving aid out of the state funds, on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, language or any of them. This provision guarantees the rights of a citizen as an individual irrespective of the Page 37 community to which he belongs. (a) SCOPE OF ART. 29(1) By S. 123(3)of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, an appeal by a candidate to vote, or refrain from voting, for a person on the ground of language is made a corrupt practice. InJagdev Singh v. Pratap Singh, 2 the Supreme Court has emphasized that this clause must be read subject to Art. 29(1), for it could not be construed so as to trespass upon the Fundamental Right in question. Article 29(1) includes the right \"to agitate for the protection of the language.\" Making promises by a candidate to work for the conservation of the electorate's language does not amount to a corrupt practice. Unlike Art. 19(1),3 Art. 29(1) is not subject to any reasonable restrictions. The right conferred upon the citizens to conserve their language, etc., is made absolute by the Constitution. A legal provision requiring the Guru Nanak University to promote studies and research in Punjabi language and literature, and to undertake measures for the development of Punjabi language, literature and culture, does not infringe Art. 29(1). The Supreme Court has emphasized that the purpose and object of the linguistic States, which have now come to stay in India, is to provide, greater facility for the development of the people of the area educationally, socially and culturally in the regional language. The concerned State or the University has every right to provide for the education of the majority in the regional medium. This, however, is subject to the restrictions contained in Arts. 25 to 30. Promotion of the majority language does not mean stifling of the minority language or script. To do so will be to trespass on the rights of those sections of the citizens which have a distinct language or script and which they have the right to conserve through their own educational institutions. The provision in question cannot, therefore, be read as requiring the minority institutions affiliated to the Guru Nanak University to teach in the Punjabi language, or in any way impeding their right to conserve their language, script and culture.4 The Supreme Court has observed in the instant case: \"The provision, as we construe it, is for the promotion of Punjabi studies and research in and the development of the Punjabi language, literature and culture which is far from saying that the University can under that provision compel the affiliated colleges particularly those of the minority to give instruction in the Punjabi Language, or in any way impede the right to conserve their language, script and culture.\"5 The provision was also challenged on the ground that the colleges administered by other religious minorities, i.e., Arya Samaj, and affiliated to the University would be compelled to study the religious teachings of Guru Nanak and this would amount to a violation of Art. 29. The Supreme Court rejected the argument saying that there is no mandate in the provision for compelling affiliated colleges either to study the religious teachings of Guru Nanak, or to adopt in any way the culture of the Sikhs. If the University makes provision for an academic and philosophical study and research of the life and teachings of a saint, it cannot be said that the affiliated colleges are being required to compulsorily study his life and teachings.6 The Constitutional validity of the imposition of Marathi language as a compulsory study in schools run by linguistic minorities was questioned in Usha Mehta v. State of Maharashtra7. The Court relied on the \"three-language formula\" and held: \"It is difficult to read Articles 29 and 30 in such a way that they contain the negative right to exclude the learning of regional language. Ipso facto it is not possible to accept the proposition that the people living in a particular State cannot be asked to study the regional language\".8 The distinction with the earlier mentioned case is that there was no requirement that the medium of instruction should be in the regional language. The right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice under Art. 30(1) read with Art. 29(1) would include the right to have choice of medium of instruction in imparting education. Consequently a Government Order insofar as it directed minority educational institutions to convert the medium of instruction from English to Kannada was struck Page 38 down by the Karnataka High Court.9 (b) GENERALITY OF ART. 29(2) The benefit of Art. 29(2) is not confined only to minority groups but extends to all citizens whether belonging to majority or minority groups in the matter of admission to the educational institutions maintained or aided by the State. Article 29(2) is broad and unqualified. It confers a special right on all citizens for admission into the state maintained or aided educational institutions. To limit this right only to minority groups will amount to holding that the citizens of the majority group have no right to be admitted into an educational institution for the maintenance of which they contribute by way of taxes.10 To enforce the restrictions laid down in Art. 29(2), a High Court can issue a writ under Art.",

To limit this right only to minority groups will amount to holding that the citizens of the majority group have no right to be admitted into an educational institution for the maintenance of which they contribute by way of taxes.10 To enforce the restrictions laid down in Art. 29(2), a High Court can issue a writ under Art. 226 even against a private institution receiving aid from the state.11 Art. 29(2) makes it very clear that a private institution receiving aid from the state cannot discriminate on grounds of religion, caste, etc.12 However Art. 29(2) does not create an absolute right for citizens to be admitted into any educational institution maintained by the State or receiving aid out of State funds in that it does not prohibit the denial of admission on grounds other than religion, race, caste or language. The word \"only\" also suggests that if it is found that the denial of admission by any educational institution maintained by the State or receiving aid out of State funds is not merely on any of the prohibited grounds but also on some additional grounds, not being irrelevant or fanciful, the mandate of clause (2) of Art. 29 is not violated. Denying admission, even though seats are available, on the ground of the applicant's religion, race, caste or language, is prohibited, but preferring students of minority groups does not violate Art. 29(2).13 (c) SCOPE OF ARTICLE 29(2) The question of application of Art. 29(2) arose for the first time in State of Madras v. Champakam .14 The Communal G.O. of the State of Madras allotted seats in medical and engineering colleges in the State proportionately to the several communities, viz., non-Brahmin Hindus, Backward Hindus, Brahmins, Harijans, Anglo-Indians, Christians and Muslims. A Brahmin candidate who could not be admitted to an engineering college challenged the G.O. as being inconsistent with Art. 29(2). The Supreme Court held that the classification in the G.O. was based on religion, race and caste which was inconsistent with Art. 29(2). Even though the petitioner had got much higher marks than those secured by many non-Brahmins who were admitted in the seats allotted to them, he could not be admitted into any institution. The only reason for denial of admission to him was that he was a Brahmin and not a non-Brahmin.15 In State of Bombay v. Bombay Education Society, 16 an order issued by the Bombay Government banning admission of those whose language was not English to a school using English as a medium of instruction, was declared invalid under Art. 29(2). The Government had argued that the order did not debar citizens from admission into English medium schools only on the ground of religion, race, caste, language, but on the ground that such denial would promote the advancement of the national language. Rejecting the contention, the Supreme Court pointed out that the argument overlooked the distinction between the object underlying the impugned order and the mode and manner adopted therein to achieve that object. The object underlying the order was laudable but even then its validity had to be judged by the method of its operation and its effect on the Fundamental Right guaranteed by Art. 29(2). The immediate ground for denying admission in English schools to pupils whose mother tongue was not English was only language and so the order could not be upheld. Thus, discrimination in matters of admission on the basis of language was vetoed by the Supreme Court under Art. 29(2). Dividing a State into two regions, and then allocating seats in engineering and medical colleges in the State Page 39 between these regions, does not violate either Art. 15(1)17 or Art. 29(2), for the reservation is on the basis of residence and not birth, and residence is not a prohibited ground under Art. 15(1).18 A candidate who is refused admission into an educational institution because he does not possess requisite academic qualifications,19 or because he was expelled on the ground of indiscipline,20 cannot invoke Art. 29(2).21 Reservation of seats in a medical college for students passing out class VIII from rural schools was held bad in Suneel Jatley v. State of Haryana .22 The government sought to justify the reservation on the ground that urban candidates were reluctant to serve in rural areas. The Supreme Court ruled that the basis of differentiation was irrational. After passing out class VIII from a rural area, a candidate could study in an urban school but still he would be preferred. An urban student could join a rural school and pass out class VIII from there and be entitled to a reserved place. Education up to VIII class hardly had any relevance to medical education and thus there was no nexus between the basis of classification and the object sought to be achieved.23 (d) ARTS. 29(2) AND 15(1) As already discussed, Art. 15(1) also prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion, race, sex, caste or place of birth. There are, however, significant differences between Art. 15(1) and Art. 29(2). While Art. 15(1) protects all citizens against discrimination by the state on the grounds stated therein, Art. 29(2) extends protection against the state, or anybody else, who denies the right conferred by it. Further, while Art. 15(1) protects all citizens against discrimination generally in all matters, Art. 29(2) gives protection against only a particular species of wrong, namely, denial of admission into state aided or maintained educational institutions. While Art. 15(1) prohibits discrimination, inter alia, on the ground of sex or place of birth, Art. 29(2) does not mention these grounds with the result that the forbidden grounds of discrimination are more numerous under Art. 15(1) than those under Art. 29(2). Art. 15(1) being broader in scope than Art. 29(2), it will apply and cover the area when Art.",

Art. 15(1) being broader in scope than Art. 29(2), it will apply and cover the area when Art. 29(2) is not applicable or does not cover the area.24 Thus, refusal to admit someone in an educational institution on the grounds of sex or place of birth will be invalid under Art. 15(1) if not under Art. 29(2). Reservation of seats in an educational institution on the basis of domicile is impermissible in terms of clause (1) of Art. 15 of the Constitution of India.25 (e) ARTS. 15(4) AND 29(2) Article 15(4) was added by the First Amendment of the Constitution after Champakam to ensure advancement of the socially and educationally backward classes of citizens, or of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The Fundamental Right guaranteed by Art. 29(2) is abridged to some extent by Art. 15(4) under which seats may be reserved in an educational institution for certain sections of the Indian citizens.26 A provision to be valid under Art. 15(4) is to be for the advancement of the backward classes and not for abridging their rights under any other provision of the Constitution. If a State prescribes a maximum of 15 per cent seats in a teaching institution for the backward classes, and if the students from these classes by their merit secure more than 15 per cent seats in the general competition, then the rule of 15 per cent cannot be invoked to reject the students over the prescribed number, for in that case their Fundamental Right under Art. 29(2) would be infringed.27 Any reservation of seats in an educational institution not justified by Art. 15(4) cannot be valid. The kind of communal reservation invalidated in Champakam would still not be valid under Art. 15(4) as that reservation was based on religion, caste and race and was not for the backward classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes only. (f) ARTS. 15(5) AND 29(2) T.M.Pai28drew a distinction between aided and unaided educational institutions holding that the State cannot Page 40 insist on private educational institutions which receive no aid from the State to implement the State's policy on reservation for granting admission on lesser percentage of marks i.e. on any criterion except merit. This was sought to be overcome by the Constitution (Ninety-third Amendment) Act, 2005, by which Clause (5) was inserted in Art. 15 of the Constitution. The clause empowers the State to make special provision, by law, for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes insofar as such special provisions relate to their admission to the educational institutions including private educational institutions, whether aided or unaided by the State, other than the minority educational institutions referred to in Clause (1) of Art. 30. Unlike clause (4) of Art. 15, clause (5) does not exclude Art. 29(2). Therefore a law made in exercise of power under Art. 15(5) would not be barred under Art. 29(2).29 Parliament then passed the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, 200630, section 3 of which provides for reservation of 15% seats for Scheduled Castes, 7½% seats for Scheduled Tribes and 27% for Other Backward Classes in Central Educational Institutions. Both the Constitutional amendment as well as the Act were recently challenged by State maintained institutions and aided educational institutions in Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India31. The argument that the Constitutional Amendment is violative of the \"basic structure\" of the Constitution was rejected. The constitutionality of the Act was also upheld. B. RIGHT OF A MINORITY TO ESTABLISH EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS (a) ART. 30 Article 30(1) gives the linguistic or religious minorities the following two rights: (1) The right to establish, and (2) The right to administer educational institutions of their choice. The benefit of Art. 30(1) extends only to linguistic or religious minorities and not to any other section of the Indian citizens. Article 30(2) bars the state, while granting aid to educational institutions, from discriminating against any educational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a linguistic or a religious minority. Art. 30(2) mandates that in granting aid to educational institutions, the state shall not discriminate against any educational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority, whether based on religion or language. Under Art. 30(2), no minority educational institution can claim state aid as a matter of right, but even minority educational institutions are entitled to get financial assistance much the same way as the educational institutions run by the majority community. The state is bound to maintain equality of treatment in granting aid to educational institutions. Minority institutions are not to be treated differently while giving financial assistance. Receipt of aid by a minority educational institution does not impair its rights under Art. 30(1).32 The Supreme Court has pointed out in Ahmedabad St. Xaviers College v. State of Gujarat, 33 that the spirit behind Art. 30(1) is the conscience of the nation that the minorities, religious as well as linguistic, are not prohibited from establishing and administering educational institutions, of their choice for the purpose of giving their children the best general education to make them complete men and women of the country. The expression \"educational institutions\" means institutions that impart education, including education at all levels from the primary school level up to the postgraduate level as also professional education.34 The minorities have been given protection under Art. 30 in order to preserve and strengthen the integrity and unity of the country. The sphere of general secular education will develop the commonness of boys and girls of India. This is in the true spirit of liberty, equality and fraternity through the medium of education.",

The sphere of general secular education will develop the commonness of boys and girls of India. This is in the true spirit of liberty, equality and fraternity through the medium of education. The minorities will feel isolated and separate if they are not given the protection of Art. 30. General secular education will open doors of perception and act as the natural light of mind for our countrymen to live in the whole. Page 41 (b) WHAT IS A MINORITY? Article 30(1) uses the terms 'linguistic' or 'religious' minorities. The word 'or' means that a minority may either be linguistic or religious and that it does not have to be both--a religious minority as well as linguistic minority. It is sufficient of it is one or the other or both. A linguistic minority for purposes of Art. 30(1) is one which has a separate spoken language. It is not necessary that that language should also have a separate script. India has a number of languages which have no script of their own, but, nonetheless, people speaking such a language will constitute a linguistic minority to claim protection of Art. 30(1).35 The Constitution uses the term 'minority' without defining it. In The Kerala Education Bill In re,36 the Supreme Court opined that while it is easy to say that minority means a community which is numerically less than 50 per cent, the important question is 50 per cent of what? Should it be of the entire population of India, or of a State, or a part thereof? It is possible that a community may be in majority in a State but in a minority in the whole of India. A community may be concentrated in a part of a State and may thus be in majority there, though it may be in minority in the State as a whole. If a part of a State is to be taken, then the question is where to draw the line and what unit is to be taken into consideration--a district, town, a municipality or its wards. The Supreme Court did not however decide this point definitively. However, it had come to be accepted that 'minority' is to be determined only in relation to the particular legislation which is being challenged. Thus, if a State law extending to the whole of a State is in question, the minority must be determined with reference to the entire State population. In such a case, any community, linguistic or religious, which is numerically less than 50 per cent of the entire State population, will be regarded as a minority for purposes of Art. 30(1). Thus, the Christian community being 22 per cent of the population in Kerala is a minority there. This view was altered in T.M.Pai's case where the view of the majority was that the minority for the purpose of Art. 30 cannot have different meanings depending upon who is legislating.37 EARLIER LAW The ruling in the Kerala Education Bill has been reiterated by the Supreme Court in the Guru Nanak University case.38 In that case, the Supreme Court rejected the contention of the State of Punjab that a religious or linguistic minority should be a minority in relation to the entire population of India. The Court has ruled that a minority has to be determined, in relation to the particular legislation which is sought to be impugned. If it is a State law, the minorities have to be determined in relation to the State population. The Hindus in Punjab constitute a religious minority. Therefore, Arya Samajists in Punjab also constitute a religious minority having their own distinct language and script.39 \"They are therefore entitled to invoke the right guaranteed under Art. 29(1) because they are a section of citizens having a distinct script and under Art. 30(1) because of their being a religious minority\". The Court has left open the question whether the Arya Samajists can be regarded as a \"religious denomination\" or not for purposes of Art. 26(a). The Anglo-Indians constitute a religious as well as a linguistic minority.40 They thus enjoy the right to conserve their language, script and culture under Art. 29(1) and to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice under Art. 30(1). The Theosophical Society is not a religious minority.41 It is within the realm of possibility that the population of a State may be so fragmented that no linguistic or religious group may by itself constitute 50 per cent of the total State population. In such a situation, every group will fall within the umbrella of Art. 30(1) without there being a majority group in the State against which minorities need to claim protection.42 In the Union Territory of Delhi, Arya Samaj is a religious denomination for purposes of Art. 26, and may claim certain rights under Arts. 25, 28 and 29, but it is not a 'minority based on religion' for purposes of Art. 30(1), for it is only a reformed sect of Hinduism, is a part of the Hindu religion and is not a separate religion at all. But the Gauhati High Court has ruled that as the percentage of the Hindu population in the State of Meghalaya is small, Arya Samaj is both a religious as well as a linguistic minority in the State having distinct Page 42 entity of their own.43 Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists, on the other hand, though subject to Hindu personal law, do constitute minorities based on religion as these religions are separate from Hinduism. Support for this view has been found from the wordings of Exp. II to Art.",

    "content": "for this view has been found from the wordings of Exp. II to Art. 25.44 The Court has pointed out that if various sections and classes of the Hindus were to be regarded as 'minorities' under Art. 30(1), then the Hindus would be divided into numerous sections and classes and cease to be a majority any longer. The sections of one religion cannot constitute religious minorities. The term 'minority based on religion' should be restricted only to those religious minorities, e.g., Muslims, Christians, Jains, Buddhists, Sikhs, etc., which have kept their identity separate from the majority, namely, the Hindus.45 Jain Swetambar Terapanthi sect is a religious and linguistic minority and is not a part of Hindu religion as it possesses a faith different from the Hindu religion.46 A society to promote educational and cultural interests of Malayalies in the State of Karnataka represents a 'linguistic' minority speaking Malayalam.47 The Supreme Court has ruled in S.K. Patro v. State of Bihar, 48 that a minority claiming privilege under Art. 30 should be a minority of persons residing in India. Foreigners not residing in India do not fall within the scope of Art. 30. Residents in India and forming the \"well defined religious or linguistic minority\" fall under the protection of Art. 30. Further, while rights under Art. 29 can be claimed only by the Indian citizens, Art. 30 does not expressly refer to citizenship as a qualification for the members of the minorities. The fact that funds have been obtained from outside India for setting up and developing a school is no ground for denying to it protection under Art. 30. T.M.PAI FOUNDATION V. KARNATAKA49 This decision specifically dealt with the issue whether in order to determine the existence of a religious or linguistic minority in relation to Art. 30, the State or the country as a whole is to be taken as the unit. Of the eleven judges constituting the Bench, Kripal C.J. delivered judgment for 6 of the judges. There were three concurring and two dissenting judgments on the issue.The majority view was that language being the basis for the establishment of different States, for the purposes of Art. 30, a \"linguistic minority\" will have to be determined in relation to the State in which the educational institution is sought to be established. The position with regard to the religious minority is similar, since both religious and linguistic minorities have been put on a par in Art. 30.50 Therefore the test for determining who are linguistic or religious minorities within the meaning of Art. 30 would be one and the same either in relation to a State legislation or Central legislation.51 The minority view was that the question of minority status must be judged in relation to the offending piece of legislation or executive order. If the source of the infringing action is the State, then the protection must be given against the State and the status of the individual or group claiming the protection must be determined with reference to the territorial limits of the State. When the entire nation is sought to be affected by Union legislation, the question of minority status must be determined with reference to the country as a whole.52 Thus assuming that Parliament itself prescribes Hindi as the compulsory medium of instruction in all educational institutions throughout the length and breadth of the country, if a minority's status is to be determined only with respect to the territorial limits of a State, non-Hindi speaking persons who are in a majority in their own State but in a minority in relation to the rest of the country, would not be able to impugn the legislation on the ground that it interferes with their right to preserve a distinct language and script. Such examples can be multiplied.53 The Court in T.M.A.Paidid not decide about the authority competent to decide about the minority status under Art. 30. The National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions Act, 200454now enables the Commission set up under the Act to \"decide all questions relating to the status of any institution as a Minority Educational Institution and declare its status as such\".55Section 10 enables any person desiring to establish a Minority Educational Institution to approach the competent authority for grant of No Objection Certificate for the said purpose and and any person aggrieved by the order of refusal to grant no objection certificate by the Competent authority may prefer an appeal against such order to the Commission.56 In view of this specific provision, despite the wide suo-motu powers granted to the Commission under the Act, it cannot itself consider consider an application for permission to start a minority educational institution.57 Page 43 (c) ESTABLISH AND ADMINISTER The words 'administer' and 'establish' in Art. 30(1) have to be read conjunctively. Therefore, a minority can claim a right to administer an educational institution only if it has been established by it but not otherwise. The court in T.M.A.Pai was unanimously of the view that the right to establish and administer an institution in Art. 30(1) of the Constitution, comprises the rights: (a) to admit students; (b) to set up a reasonable fee structure; (c) to constitute a governing body; (d) to appoint staff (teaching and non-teaching); and (e) to take action if there is dereliction of duty on the part of any of the employees. A religious minority cannot claim the right to administer an educational institution established by some one else, merely because, for some reason or other, it had been administering the institution before the Constitution came into force. Article 30(1) postulates that the religious community will have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice meaning thereby that where a religious minority establishes an educational institution, it will have the right to administer that.",

    "content": "30(1) postulates that the religious community will have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice meaning thereby that where a religious minority establishes an educational institution, it will have the right to administer that. The right to administer has been given to the minority, so that it can mould the institution as it thinks fit, and in accordance with its ideas of how the interest of the community in general, and the institution in particular, will be best served. For purposes of Art. 30(1), even a single philanthropic individual from the concerned minority can found the institution with his own means.58 The Aligarh Muslim University was established by a statute. It could not therefore be said to have been established by the Muslim community. No degree granting institution can be established in India without a statute. Accordingly, the validity of a statute regulating administrative arrangements in the University could not be adjudged under Art. 30(1).59 The material factor to attract Art. 30(1) is the establishment of the institution by the minority concerned. As the Supreme Court has observed in Azeez Basha:60 \" Art. 30(1) postulates that the religious community will have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice meaning thereby that where a religious minority establishes an educational institution, it will have the right to administer that... The Art. in our opinion clearly shows that the minority will have the right to administer educational institutions of their choice provided they have established them, but not otherwise.\"34 Art. 30 cannot be read to mean that even if the educational institution has been established by somebody else, any religious minority would have the right to administer it because, for some reason or the other, it might have been administering it before the Constitution came into force.\"61 It is a matter of proof through production of satisfactory evidence that the institution in question was established by the minority claiming to administer it. The proof of the fact of establishment of the institution is a condition precedent for claiming the right to administer the institution. The onus lies on one who asserts that an institution is a minority institution.62 The courts may have to decide whether an institution is a minority institution. For this purpose, the court has power to ascertain the necessary facts in a writ petition. In S.P. Mittal v. Union of India, 63 the Supreme Court has stated: \"In order to claim the benefit of Art. 30(1), the community must show: (a) that it is a religious/linguistic minority, (b) that the institution was established by it. Without satisfying these two conditions it cannot claim the guaranteed rights to administer it.\" In Andhra Pradesh Christian Medical Association v. Government of Andhra Pradesh, 64 the Supreme Court has asserted that the Government, the University and ultimately the court can go behind the claim that the institution in question is a minority institution and \"to investigate and satisfy itself whether the claim is well- founded or ill founded\". The Government, the University and ultimately the court \"have the undoubted right to pierce the minority veil\" and \"discover whether there is lurking behind it no minority at all and in any case no minority institution.\". The Supreme Court emphasized that the object of Art. 30(1) is not to allow bogies to be raised by Page 44 pretenders. The institution must be an educational institution of minority in truth and reality and not mere masked phantoms. In the instant case, the Court held that the institution in question was not a minority institution. The Court clarified that the protection of Art. 30(1) is not available if the institution is a mere cloak or pretension and the real motive is business adventure. Such institutions must be of the minorities \"in truth and reality and not \"mere masked phantoms\". In this case, the claim for minority status was made by a purchaser of the school. The institution was started as a business adventure with a view to make money from gullible persons anxious to obtain admission to professional colleges. So, the Court refused to treat it as a minority educational institution. In Yogendra Nath Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 65 the Government recognised an institution as a minority institution. This order was challenged in the High Court through a writ petition. Looking into the antecedent history of institution right from its inception, the Court concluded that the institution was not established as a minority institution, and, therefore, it could not be granted minority status even though presently it was being managed by the minority community. Under Art. 30(1), the requirements of establishment and management have to be read conjunctively. The twin requirements have to be established and in the absence of one, an institution cannot be granted minority status. The Supreme Court has thus tried to restrict the misuse of the benefits granted to the minorities. People make false claims that an institution is a minority educational institution because such an institution carries with it a good deal of privileges and protection which are not available to a non-minority educational institution. Where an institution was established about a century ago by a minority community, but the administration of the institution was with the Government for a very long time it was held by the High Court of Andhra Pradesh that it cannot be treated as a minority institution.66 Again where the memorandum of association/bye-laws of the institution did not provide for any special rights or privileges such as reservation etc. to the children of the Sikh minority community it was taken as showing that the institution did not primarily cater to the needs of the said minority community and as such it could not avail of the protection under Art. 30(1).67 Even government recognition of an institution being a minority educational institution does not immunize it from judicial scrutiny of its antecedents.",

The government decision is not binding and it is ultimately for the court to decide whether the institution in question is a minority institution or not. The mere fact that the school was founded by a person belonging to a particular religion does not make it a minority institution.68 The mere fact that funds were obtained from abroad for assisting in setting up and developing the school which was established by a minority in India, or that its management was carried on at times by some persons who were not born in India could not be a ground to deny to it the protection of Art. 30(1).69 A minority school continues to be so whether the government declares it as such or not. When the government declares the school as a minority school, it merely recognises a factual position that the school was established and is being administered by a minority community. The declaration is merely an open acceptance of the legal character of the institution which must necessarily have existed antecedent to such declaration. Such a declaration is neither necessary nor decisive of the character of the institution in question as a minority educational institution. The final word in this regard rests with the courts. It is ultimately for the court to decide whether the institution in question is a minority institution or not.70 A society consisting of minority members, or even a single member of a minority community, may establish an institution. The position has been clarified by the Supreme Court in State of Kerala v. Mother Provincial .71 The Court has stated on this point: \"It matters not if a single philanthropic individual with his own means, founds the institution or the community at large contributes the funds. The position in law is the same and the intention in either case must be to found an institution for the benefit of a minority community by a member of that community.\" Page 45 A minority institution may impart general secular education; it need not confine itself only to the teaching of minority language, culture or religion. But to be treated as a minority institution, it must be shown that it serves or promotes in some manner the interests of the minority community by promoting its religious tenets, philosophy, culture, language or literature. Article 30 gives right to the minority as such, and not to an individual member, and the right is meant to benefit the minority by protecting and promoting its interests. There should be a nexus between the institution and the particular minority to which it claims to belong. A considerable section of the minority must be benefited by the institution. The test is \"whether the institution does in any manner serve or promote the interests of the minority to which it claims to belong?\"72 The Supreme Court has emphasized upon this point in Christian Medical Association:73 \"What is important and what is imperative is that there must exist some real positive index to enable the institution to be identified as an educational institution of the minorities.\" A school was established by the Jain Swetambar Sect. The members of the Sect donated a considerable sum of money for establishing the institution. The school was being run to promote the culture and religious tenets of the Sect primarily along with secular education imparted to the pupils, a majority of whom belonged to the Sect in question. The school was held entitled to the benefit of Art. 30(1).74 An institution was established by a Gujarati. All its trustees were Gujarati; the medium of instruction was Gujarati and 80% teachers were Gujarati-speaking. It was characterised as an educational institution established by the minority community. Admitting non-Gujarati students was not decisive of the character of the institution.75 In the context of Art. 29(2) the Supreme Court has observed in In re the Kerala Education Bill :76 \"The real import of Art. 29(2) and Art. 30(1) seems to us to be that they clearly contemplate a minority institution with a sprinkling of outsiders admitted into it.\" The idea has been reinforced by the Supreme Court in the St. Stephens College case,77 where the Court has observed that Art. 30(1) does not mean that the minority can establish an educational institution solely for the benefit of its own community people. The minorities are not entitled to establish such institutions for their exclusive benefit. The Court observed: \"Every educational institution irrespective of community to which it belongs is a 'melting pot' in our national life\" and that it is essential that there should be a \"proper mix of students of different communities in all educational institutions.\" This meant that a minority institution cannot refuse admission to students of other minority and majority communities. In this connection the Supreme Court has observed as under in St. Stephens:78 \"Even in practice, such claims are likely to be met with considerable hostility. It may not be conducive to have relatively a homogeneous society. It may lead to religious bigotry which is the bane of mankind. In the nation building with secular character sectarian schools or colleges; segregated faculties or Universities for imparting general secular education are undesirable and they may undermine secular democracy.",

    "content": "would be inconsistent with the central concept of secularism and equality embodied in the Constitution.\"79 This is an argument against having exclusive minority educational institutions which deny admission to students outside the specific minority establishing the institution in question was differed from by the majority in T.M.A.Pai and reinforced unanimously by the decision in P.A. Inamdar v. State of Maharashtra which said: \"The employment of expressions \"right to establish and administer\" and \"educational institution of their choice\" in Art. 30(1) gives the right very wide amplitude. Therefore, a minority educational institution has a right to admit students of its own choice, it can, as a matter of its own free will, admit students of non-minority community. However, non-minority students cannot be forced upon it. The only restriction on the free will of the minority educational institution admitting students belonging to a non-minority community is, as spelt out by Art. 30 itself, that the manner and number of such admissions should not be violative of the minority character of the institution\".80 (d) RELATION BETWEEN ARTS. 29 AND 30 Page 46 A comparison between Arts. 29(1) and 30(1) would show the following: Article 29 protects the rights only of the Indian citizens while Art. 30 does not refer to citizenship as a pre-condition. While any section of the Indian citizens including the majority can invoke Art. 29(1), Art. 30 is available only to the religious or linguistic minorities. There is a close affinity between Arts. 29(1) and 30. A minority community can best conserve its language, script or culture through educational institutions, for it is through education that the language and culture of a minority can be inculcated into the impressionable minds of the children of the community. The right to establish and maintain educational institutions of its choice by a minority is, therefore, concomitant to its right to conserve its distinctive language, script or culture, and that is what is envisaged by Art. 30(1). But it does not mean that only such minority institution is entitled to the protection of Art. 30 as is exclusively engaged in the conservation of minority language, script or culture, and that an institution of general education established by a minority cannot claim such protection. The Supreme Court ruled that Arts. 29 and 30 create two separate rights and that \"the width of Art. 30(1) cannot be cut down by introducing in it considerations on which Art. 29(1) is based.\"81 The advantage of Art. 30 is available to all minority educational institutions and not only to those whose object is to conserve or promote the language of the minority.82 In this connection, the Supreme Court has observed in In re Kerala Education Bill :83 \" Article 30(1) gives certain rights not only to religious minorities but also to linguistic minorities....the right conferred on such minorities is to establish educational institutions of their choice. It does not say that minorities based on religion should establish educational institutions for teaching religion only, or that linguistic minorities should have the right to establish educational institutions for teaching their language only. What the Art. says and means is that the religious and linguistic minorities should have the right to establish educational institutions of their choice. There is no limitation placed on the subjects to be taught in such educational institutions. As such minorities ordinarily desire that their children should be brought up properly and be eligible for higher university education and go out in the world fully equipped with such intellectual attainments as will make them fit for entering the public services, educational institutions of their choice will necessarily include institutions imparting general secular education also. In other words, the Art. leaves it to their choice to establish such educational institutions as will serve their religion, language or culture and also the purpose of giving a thorough good general education to their children.\"84 Article 29(1) gives general protection to minorities to conserve their language etc., while Art. 30(1) gives to them a special right to establish institutions of their 'choice'. The crucial phrase in Art. 30(1) is 'of their choice', and their 'choice' cannot be limited merely to institutions seeking to conserve language, script or culture of the minorities. Thus, a minority whether based on religion or language has a right to establish institutions of a general secular character not designed to conserve their language, etc., such as a college of general education, or a teachers' training college, etc.85 Nor is the choice of the minority taken away if in an educational institution established by it, students of other communities are also admitted. In reality, under Art. 29(2), a State-aided educational institution, even though established and run by a minority, is obligated not to deny admission to members of other communities on grounds only of religion, race, caste and language.86 A provision in the Gujarat University Act authorising the University to undertake teaching in undergraduate classes, and deprive the minority colleges from such teaching was held to infringe Art. 30(1). Similarly, a power in the University to make affiliated colleges as constituent colleges and integrate them with the University was held not applicable to minority colleges for they would thereby lose their individual and minority character.87 C. REGULATION OF MINORITY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS (a) INTRODUCTORY The fundamental freedom under Art. 30(1) is prima facie absolute in nature as it is not made subject to any reasonable restrictions. This means that all minorities, linguistic or religious, have by Art. 30(1) right to Page 47 establish and administer educational institutions of their choice and \"any law or executive direction which seeks to infringe the substance of that right under Art. 30(1) would to that extent be void.\" The above provision does not however mean that the state can impose no regulations on the minority institutions. As early as 1958, in the famous Kerala Education Bill, the Supreme Court has observed: \"The right conferred on the religious and linguistic minorities to administer educational institutions of their choice is not an absolute right\".",

    "content": "right to Page 47 establish and administer educational institutions of their choice and \"any law or executive direction which seeks to infringe the substance of that right under Art. 30(1) would to that extent be void.\" The above provision does not however mean that the state can impose no regulations on the minority institutions. As early as 1958, in the famous Kerala Education Bill, the Supreme Court has observed: \"The right conferred on the religious and linguistic minorities to administer educational institutions of their choice is not an absolute right\". Although Art. 30(1) is couched in absolute terms in marked contrast with such Fundamental Rights as are contained in Art. 19(1), it has to be read subject to the regulatory power of the state. Regulations which do not affect the substance of the guaranteed rights, but ensure the excellence of the institution and its proper functioning in matters educational, are permissible.88 Regulations could be made to maintain educational character and standard of institution. \"When any regulatory measure is assailed, it would be obligatory for the court to find out as to whether the provisions in fact secures a reasonable balance between ensuring a standard of excellence of the institution and of preserving the right of the minority to administer the institution as a minority institution.\"89 The right to administer cannot encompass the right to maladminister. By its interpretative process over the years, the Supreme Court has given a wide sweep to the protection conferred on the minority educational institutions under Art. 30(1) as well as permitted some regulation thereof by the concerned government in the interest of the well being of the institution concerned. From the point of view of regulation, minority educational institutions can be placed into two categories, viz. (1) institutions receiving aid from the state; and (2) institutions not getting aid from the state, each category being further sub-divided according to the nature of the educational institution, namely schools, undergraduate colleges, post-graduate colleges and professional colleges.90 (b) GOVERNMENT GRANTS/RECOGNITION Questions concerning giving of government grants, or according affiliation or recognition, to educational institutions established and managed by the minorities have often been raised before the courts vis-a-vis Art. 30(1). Such questions are of great significance to these institutions. At present, the situation is such that an educational institution cannot possibly hope to survive, and function effectively, without government grants, nor can it confer degrees without affiliation to a University. Although minorities establish and run their educational institutions with a view to educate their children in an atmosphere congenial to the conservation of their language or culture, yet that is not their only aim. They also desire that their students are well-equipped for useful careers in life. The students of unrecognised institutions can neither get admission in institutions of higher learning nor can they enter public service. Therefore, without recognition, a minority run institution cannot fulfil its role effectively and the right conferred by Art. 30(1) would be very much diluted. A meaningful or real exercise of the right under Art. 30(1) must, therefore, mean the right to establish effective educational institutions which may subserve the real needs of the minorities and the scholars who resort to them. This necessarily involves recognition or affiliation of minority institutions, for without this the institutions cannot play their role effectively and the right conferred on the minorities by Art. 30(1) would be denuded of much of its efficacy.91 Art 30(2) debars the state from discriminating against minority institutions in the matter of giving grants. But the question is: can the government impose regulations and conditions on minority institutions for giving them aid or according recognition to them? In Frank Anthony,92 the Court has explained the position thus: \"The extent of the right under Art. 30(1) is to be determined, not with reference to any concept of state necessity and general societal interest but with reference to the educational institutions themselves, that is, with reference to the goal of making the institutions effective vehicles of education for the minority community or other persons who resort to them. It follows that regulatory measures which are designed towards the achievement of the goal of making the minority educational institutions effective instruments for imparting the education cannot be considered to impinge upon the rights guaranteed by Art. 30(1) of the Constitution. The question in each case is whether the particular measure is, Page 48 in the ultimate analysis, designed to achieve such goal, without of course nullifying any part of the right of the management in substantial measure.\" As held in T.M.A. Pai conditions which can normally be permitted to be imposed on the edcational institutions receiving the grant must be related to the proper utilisation of the grant and fulfilment of the objectives of the grant without diluting the minority status of the educational institution.1 In Managing Board, M.T.M. v. State of Bihar, 2 the Supreme Court has emphasized that the right to establish educational institutions of their choice must mean the right to establish real institutions which will effectively serve the needs of their community and the scholars who resort to them. Clarifying the position as regards the question of affiliation of, or grant to, minority institutions, the Court has observed: \"There is, no doubt, no such thing as Fundamental Right to recognition by the State but to deny recognition to the educational institutions except upon terms tantamount to the surrender of their constitutional right of administration of the educational institutions of their choice is in truth and in effect to deprive them of their rights under Art. 30(1). We repeat that the legislative power is subject to the Fundamental Rights and the legislature cannot indirectly take away or abridge the Fundamental Rights which it could not do directly ......\" Can a State deny recognition to a minority institution on the ground that the State already has more such institutions than required and, therefore, the policy of the government is not to permit the starting of any more such institutions?",

Can any such policy be regarded as consistent with Art. 30(1)? The State of Karnataka denied recognition to a minority teachers' training college on this basis. The High Court held the denial of recognition not valid. Without specifically deciding the question whether or not the State can have such a policy, the court concluded that the State had no such firm policy as a matter of fact as it had given permission to another similar institution which applied later than the institution in question.3 The same High Court has also held that a minority institution need not take prior permission of the government to be started. Recognition must be given to a minority institution if all the conditions have been satisfied. Recognition cannot be denied on the ground that because of the existence of one school in the locality there is no need for another school. Such a factor is irrelevant so far as a minority institution is concerned.4 In Managing Board, M.T.M. v. State of Bihar, 5 the Supreme Court quashed an order of the Bihar Government refusing recognition to a minority teachers training college. The inspection committee had inspected the college and recommended recognition while the State Government still maintained that the institution did not fulfil all the requisite conditions. The Court thus came to the conclusion that the government's refusal was based on \"purely illusory grounds which do not exist\", that it was a \"colourable exercise of its jurisdiction\" and, thus, the order was in violation of Art. 30(1). On the question of government aid to minority institutions, the Supreme Court has observed as follows in St. Stephen's College:6 \"The educational institutions are not business houses. They do not generate wealth. They cannot survive without public funds or private aid. It is said that there is also restraint on collection of students fees. With the restraint on collection of fees, the minorities cannot be saddled with the burden of maintaining educational institutions without grant-in-aid. They do not have economic advantages over others. It is not possible to have educational institutions without state aid.. The minorities cannot, therefore, be asked to maintain educational institutions on their own.\" The rights of the minorities under Art. 30 remain unaffected even after receiving financial assistance from the government. In the following case,7 the government granted recognition with aid to classes VI to VIII in a minority school. Later, the government sought to withdraw aid. The Madras High Court quashed the government order withdrawing aid saying that the minorities cannot be asked tomaintain educational institutions on their own. Every child in India, under Art. 21-A, has a right to free education up to the age of 14 years.8 (c) CONDITIONS FOR GRANTS/RECOGNITION Page 49 The next important question is: What conditions can be imposed on these institutions as a requisite to giving grants, or according affiliation or recognition to them? This has proved to be a complex and controversial problem. These conditions may be of two kinds. One type of conditions may relate to such matters as syllabi, curricula, courses, minimum qualifications of teachers, their age of superannuation, library, conditions concerning sanitary, health and hygiene of students, etc. The underlying purpose of such conditions is to promote educational standards and uniformity and help the institutions concerned achieve efficiency and excellence and are imposed not only in the interest of general secular education but also are conducive to the improvement of minority institutions themselves. Regulatory measures are necessary to maintain the educational character and content of minority institutions.9 Such conditions cannot be regarded as violative of Art. 30(1) and should, therefore, be followed by all educational institutions. The standards of education are not a part of management as such. Therefore, a University can prescribe syllabi for examinations to be followed by every institution subject to any special subjects which a minority institution may seek to teach. Such conditions must, however, satisfy a dual test: (i) these conditions should be reasonable; (ii) these are regulative of the educational character of the institution and are conducive to making it an effective vehicle of education for the minority community or other persons who resort to it. A minority institution being run in unhealthy surroundings, or without qualified teachers, or which does not maintain any fair standard of teaching cannot claim to be recognised.10 Conditions for recognition like adequate space for students can be validly imposed.11 Regulations can also be made providing for inspection or inquiry in respect of school buildings, laboratories, etc., and the mode and manner of inspection and inquiry and furnishing returns, statistics and that information to the competent authority by the school management.12 A school seeking recognition and not aid cannot be obligated not to charge fees from the students, for that would, in effect, make it impossible for the minority institution to carry on.13 The other type of conditions relate to management of the institutions. Not all such conditions can be imposed on minority institutions. Art. 30(1) prima facie confers an unqualified right on the minorities to administer the institutions established by them. But, in practice, such a right cannot be absolute. A right to administer cannot be a right to maladminister. The matter has been succinctly explained by the Supreme Court in In re Kerala Education Bill : \"The right to administer cannot obviously include the right to maladminister. The minority cannot surely ask for aid or recognition for an educational institution run by them in unhealthy surroundings.",

    "content": "in practice, such a right cannot be absolute. A right to administer cannot be a right to maladminister. The matter has been succinctly explained by the Supreme Court in In re Kerala Education Bill : \"The right to administer cannot obviously include the right to maladminister. The minority cannot surely ask for aid or recognition for an educational institution run by them in unhealthy surroundings. Without any competent teachers possessing any semblance of qualification, and which does not maintain even a fair standard of teaching or which teaches matters subversive of the welfare of the scholars. It stands to reason, then, that the constitutional right to administer an educational institution of their choice does not necessarily militate against the claim of the State to insist that in order to grant aid the State may prescribe reasonable regulations to ensure the excellence of the institutions to be aided... reasonable regulations may certainly be imposed by the State as a condition for aid or even for recognition.\" According to the recent decision of the two Constitution Benches in T.M.A.Pai14 and P.A. Inamdar15 the considerations for granting recognition to a minority educational institution and casting accompanying regulations would be similar as applicable to a non-minority institution subject to two overriding considerations: (i) the recognition is not denied solely on the ground of the educational institution being one belonging to minority, and (ii) the regulation is neither aimed at nor has the effect of depriving the institution of its minority status. Therefore, the right of a minority to administer an institution can be subjected to conditions for ensuring orderly, efficient and sound administration,16 but these conditions should not be such as to destroy or take away the right of the minorities to administer educational institutions of their choice. Conditions attached to affiliation should be such as are conceived in the interest of minority institutions as such, which make the institutions more effective but which do not amount to surrender by the minorities of their right to administer. Page 50 These conditions should not in any way take away the freedom of management or administration of the institution so as \"to reduce it to a satellite of the University or the State.\" Explaining the concept of reasonableness, the Supreme Court has emphasized that the right under Art. 30 cannot be whittled down by the so-called regulative measures conceived in the interest not of minority educational institutions, but of the public or the nation as a whole. Art. 30(1) would become illusory if every order is held justifiable in public or national interest which, while maintaining the formal character of a minority institution, destroys the power of administration, and may be in its interest as an educational institution. Regulations which may be imposed lawfully as a condition of receiving grant or recognition must be directed to making the institution effective as an educational institution. Regulations may be imposed in the true interests of efficiency of instruction, discipline, health, sanitation, morality, public order and the like. Such regulations are not restrictions on the substance of the right, but secure the proper functioning of the institutions in educational matters.17 In Sidhrajbhai, the Supreme Court refused to accept the contention that public or national interest is the sole measure or test of reasonableness, or that no regulation should be deemed unreasonable unless it is totally destructive or annihilative of the right of the minority to administer educational institution of its choice. This is not permissible. The courts have thus laid down strict parameters within which regulations can be imposed on the minorities' right to administer their institutions. The state enjoys very limited regulatory power as regards minority educational institutions. The state can impose only such regulations on such institutions as would ensure excellence in education. With the enactment of the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions Act, 2004 as amended in 2006, (Act 18 of 2006), a minority educational institution may seek affiliation to any university of its choice (section 10A) in accordance with the prescribed procedure. The Act does not expressly provide for an appeal from a refusal to grant affiliation but does allow the Commission to enquire into any dispute relating to affiliation and report its finding to the appropriate government for implementation (Section 11 (b). (d) COMPOSITION OF MANAGING BODIES Thus, the Supreme Court has invariably invalidated provisions seeking to regulate the composition and personnel of the managing bodies of minority institutions. A provision interfering with the minorities' choice of managing body for an institution has been held to violate Art. 30(1).18 For instance, the Gujarat University Act provided that the governing body of every college must include amongst its members a representative of the University nominated by the Vice-Chancellor, representatives of teaching and non-teaching staff and of the college students. In the celebrated St. Xavier's College case,19 the Supreme Court declared the provision as non-applicable to minority institutions because it displaced the management and entrusted it to a different agency; autonomy in administration was lost and new elements in the shape of representatives of different types were brought in. The Court emphasized that while the University could take steps to cure maladministration in a college, the choice of personnel of management was a part of administration which could not be interfered with. Under the Kerala University Act, 1969, governing body was to be constituted for each private college consisting of 11 members of whom 6 were to be nominated by the body which established or maintained that college. The principal, manager, a nominee each of the University and the government and a representative of the teachers of the College, were also to be on the committee. All members were to hold office for four years. It was to be a body corporate and the management of the college was to vest therein. The Supreme Courtdeclared these provisions invalid as they took away from the founders the right to administer their own institution.",

All members were to hold office for four years. It was to be a body corporate and the management of the college was to vest therein. The Supreme Courtdeclared these provisions invalid as they took away from the founders the right to administer their own institution. After the establishment of the statutory body, the founders or the community were to have no hand in the administration of the college. The governing body had a legal personality distinct from the educational agency, as the powers and functions were to be determined by the Act. Further, power was vested in the University Syndicate to veto any action of the college governing body. Power to select teachers was also taken away from the educational agency and vested in an autonomous Page 51 body. These provisions were held invalid as persons other than those in whom the founder community had confidence would have room to interfere in the college administration. Above all, under certain circumstances, the University had been given power to take away the management of a college from out of the hands of the governing council. This was also held ultra vires Art. 30(1).20 The Court commented on these various provisions as follows:21 \"We have no doubt that the provisions of the Act were made bona fide and in the interest of education but unfortunately they do affect the administration of these institutions and rob the founders of that right which the constitution desires should be theirs. The provisions even if salutary can not stand in the fall of the constitutional guarantees\". The statutes made by a University required that an affiliated college should have a regularly constituted governing body consisting of not more than 20 persons approved by the Senate including, among others, two representatives of the University and the principal of the college as an ex officio member. This was held bad by the Supreme Court because it changed the existing composition of the managing committee of the D.A.V. Colleges run by the Arya Samajists and thus affected the right of the minority under Art. 30 to administer its educational institution according to its \"choice\".22 On a parity of reasoning, it would be unconstitutional for an affiliating University or government to supersede the managing committee of a minority institution and appoint an ad hoc committee instead.23 The Calcutta High Court has said that the Education Board cannot, under any circumstances, interfere with the management of a minority school by superseding its managing committee and appointing an administrator to take charge of the school and administer it.24 On the other hand, a less rigid view on this question has been adopted by the Gauhati High Court when it says that the managing committee cannot be dissolved arbitrarily and reconstituted without giving it an opportunity of being heard. Dissolution of the managing committee of a minority school by the inspector of schools without observing principles of natural justice has been held to be invalid.25 This view accepts the power to dissolve subject to natural justice whereas the Calcutta view does not accept any such power. The Gauhati view is simply an application of the general principles of Administrative Law, especially the norms of natural justice.26 One could arrive at the Gauhati view even without the presence of Art. 30(1). The presence of Art. 30(1) should mean something more than that and the Calcutta view appears to be more in accord with what the Supreme Court has said on this point. A statutory provision conferring power on the school board to dissolve the managing committee of a madarasa, i.e., an educational institution providing instruction in Islamic, Arabic and Persian studies, has been held to be violative of Art. 30(1). A minority educational institution cannot be allowed to maladminister and the state can exercise regulatory powers over minority institutions. But the power to completely take over the management of a minority institution is not permissible under Art. 30(1).27 In All Bihar Christian Schools Association v. State of Bihar, 28 the Supreme Courtconsidered the constitutional validity of the Bihar Non-Government Secondary Schools (Taking over of Management and Control) Act, 1981, vis-a-vis Art. 30. S. 3(2) of the Act provides that the State Government may by notification in the official gazette take over the management and control of a recognised minority secondary school if its managing committee voluntarily makes an unconditional offer to hand over the school with all its property. Another provision in the Act requires every minority secondary school to have a managing committee and written bye-laws. After referring to several earlier cases in which the Supreme Court has expounded the content and scope of Art. 30(1), the Court has pointed out that while the \"minorities based on religion or language have fundamental freedom to establish and manage educational institutions of their own choice\", the \"State has right to provide regulatory provisions for ensuring educational excellence, conditions of employment of teachers, ensuring health, hygiene and discipline and allied matters\". Holding S. 3(2) constitutionally valid, the Court has said that it does not confer any power on the State to compulsorily acquire or take over the management of a minority school. The Government can take over such a school only when the management of the school makes an unconditional offer to that effect. There is no element of compulsion on the Page 52 management of a minority school to make over the school to the Government. In G.F. College, Shahjahanpur v. Agra University, 29 the Supreme Court in a 2:1 decision held a University statute valid which required the managing committee of an affiliated college to consist of the principal and one member of the staff in order of seniority by rotation. This case is more in the nature of an interpretation of the St.",

    "content": "G.F. College, Shahjahanpur v. Agra University, 29 the Supreme Court in a 2:1 decision held a University statute valid which required the managing committee of an affiliated college to consist of the principal and one member of the staff in order of seniority by rotation. This case is more in the nature of an interpretation of the St. Xavier's case.30 According to the majority view, 'regulation' of the manner of the functioning of the managing committee of a minority college to obviate maladministration is permissible. The principal is an important functionary in a college, is an appointee of the management itself, and is not a stranger to the college. His inclusion in the managing committee will be a blessing in many ways and not a curse. The same can be said about the senior-most member of the teaching staff who is also appointed by the management. There can be no objection to the \"two innocuous insiders\" being seated on the managing committee. This would improve the college administration and not inhibit its autonomy. What was held invalid in the earlier cases was the induction of 'rank outsiders' into the management thus compromising the autonomy of the institution. On the other hand, Mathew, J., (who was a party to the St. Xavier's case) took an absolutist position, viz., the determination of the composition of the managing body of a minority institution must be left to the minority itself as that is the core of the right to administer; any interference with the composition of the management of a minority college by an outside body is an abridgement of the right of the management. The minority view would appear to be more in consonance with the decision in T.M.A Pai which said that Regulations can be framed governing service conditions for teaching and other staff for whom aid is provided by the State, without interfering with the overall administrative control of the management over the staff. In case of an unaided minority educational institution, in the matter of day-to-day management, like the appointment of staff, teaching and non-teaching, and administrative control over them, the management should have the freedom and there should not be any external controlling agency. 31. (e) APPOINTMENT OF TEACHERS The selection and appointment of teachers, and the head of the institution, is regarded as pre-eminently a function of the administration. As K.K. Mathew, J., has observed supporting the majority view in Ahmedabad St. Xaviers College case:32 \"It is upon the principal and teachers of a college that the tone and temper of an educational institution depend. On them would depend its reputation, the maintenance of discipline and its efficiency in teaching. The right to choose the principal and to have the teaching conducted by teachers appointed by the management after an overall assessment of their outlook and philosophy is perhaps the most important facet of the right to administer an educational institution.\" Therefore, the position taken by the Supreme Court is that while a University can prescribe qualifications for the academic staff, the actual selection of teachers must remain in the hands of the administration of the institution and any dilution of this right of the management infringes Art. 30(1). Accordingly, a condition that any appointment of a teacher in a college will be subject to the approval of the Vice-Chancellor has been held invalid under Art. 30(1).33 A legal provision required the managing committee of an educational institution to appoint teachers in the school with the concurrence of the School Service Board. The Supreme Court held the provision to be valid.34 The Court has pointed out that as regards the consent of the School Service Board to the appointment of teachers, the Act itself clarifies that the Board while considering the question of granting approval to the appointment of a teacher would ascertain if the appointment was in accordance with the rules laying down qualifications, and the manner of making appointments framed by the Government. The choice of the person for appointment continues to vest in the managing committee of the minority school and the Board has no further power to interfere with the right of the managing committee of a minority school. This provision ensures that only qualified teachers are appointed in the school. There is no interference with the managerial rights of the institution. Appointment of qualified teachers in a minority school is a sine qua non for achieving educational standards and better administration of school. Page 53 A rule conferred on the University Syndicate the power to veto the selection of the principal or other teachers made by a college management. The rule was held non-applicable to minority institutions.35 A legal provision requiring the selection of the teachers of all affiliated colleges including those established by the minorities to be made by the University Service Commission was held to interfere with the rights of the petitioners.36 The board of management of a school established and managed by the Jesuits appointed a junior teacher, a Jesuit, as the Head Master of the school in preference to the senior-most teacher who was not a Jesuit. The Director of Education reversed the appointment and upheld the claim of the senior teacher. The management challenged the order as violative of Art. 30(1). The High Court quashed the Director's order and upheld the appointment made by the management saying that the post of the Head Master in a school is of pivotal importance, and the right to select him is the most important facet of the right to administer the school and this right of the management could not be restricted except to the extent of prescribing requisite qualifications and experience for the post.",

    "content": "rule requiring that the senior-most teacher must be promoted to the Head Master's post cannot be binding on minority schools.37 The significance of the post of headmaster in a school and that of the Principal in a college has been underlined by the courts in a number of cases.38 Accordingly, the courts have insisted that the management of a minority institution is entitled to select a person of its choice for such a post subject to qualifications and experience as may be prescribed. The Supreme Court has again upheld the right of the management of a minority institution to appoint the Headmaster of its choice.39 The Court has insisted that the right to administer the school would get very much diminished if the management does not have wide freedom to choose the personnel for holding such a key post subject, of course, to the restrictions regarding qualifications to be prescribed by the State. The Court has observed in this connection:40 \"Thus the management's right to choose a qualified person as the Headmaster of the school is well insulated by the protective cover of Art. 30(1) of the Constitution and it cannot be chiselled out through any legislative act or executive rule except for fixing up the qualifications and conditions of service for the post. Any such statutory or executive fiat would be violative of the Fundamental Right enshrined in the aforesaid Art. and would hence be void.\" The Gujarat University Act prescribed that for selection of the Principal and the teachers of a college, there should be a college selection committee having a representative appointed by the Vice-Chancellor. The Supreme Courtheld that the provision could not apply to minority colleges as there was no guidance in the Act as to what type of persons could be nominated as the representative of the Vice-Chancellor.41 In R. Sulochana Devi v. D.M. Sujatha42, in respect of the Andhra Christian College, the Supreme Court, allowing an appeal, said that the High Court ought not to have interfered with the discretionary power that is vested with the management to choose the Principal of its choice. In Secy., Malankara Syrian Catholic College v. T. Jose43, the question at issue was the applicability of Section 57(3) of the Kerala University Act, 1974 which provides that the post of Principal when filled by promotion is to be made on the basis of seniority-cum-fitness to minority institutions. The High Court held that aid carries the \"price\" of surrender of a part of its freedom and independence in matters of administration. Raveendran, J speaking for the Court reversed the finding saying that the general principles relating to establishment and administration of educational institutions by minorities under Art. 30, includes the right to appoint teaching staff (teachers/lecturers and Headmasters/ Principals) as also non-teaching staff, and to take action if there is dereliction of duty on the part of any of its employees and that the freedom to choose the person to be appointed as Principal is a vital facet of the right to administer the educational institution. This principle has not been, in any way, diluted or altered by T.M.A. Pai. Consequently Section 57(3) of the Act cannot apply to minority-run educational institutions even if they are aided. 44 A regulation providing for constitution of a selection committee for selection of teachers for appointment in a school comprising of one representative of the Administrative Officer, the Headmaster of the school, and one representative of the managing body of the school, was held invalid qua Art. 30(1) as it made a deep inroad Page 54 into the right of the management of the minority institution. The management having only one representative in a committee of three, could be outvoted by the other two members and, thus, the right of the management of the minority institution to appoint and select teachers could be completely undermined.45 A regulation was made by the University requiring compliance with the requirements laid down in the ordinances governing service conditions and conduct of teachers in affiliated colleges as framed by the University. This provision was held not invalid in its application to minority institutions as it was made in the larger interests of the institutions to ensure their efficiency and excellence. The University may prescribe age of superannuation or the minimum qualifications for the teachers and such other matters. (f) DISCIPLINARY ACTION AGAINST THE STAFF A significant facet of the administration of an educational institution is the maintenance of discipline among the members of its staff. The right of the minority institution to take disciplinary action against the teachers and other employees is a very vital aspect of the management's Fundamental Right to administer the institution. Any rule taking away or interfering with this right cannot be regarded as compatible with Art. 30(1). Thus, while fair procedural safeguards may be laid down for the purpose, the final power to take disciplinary action must vest in the management of the institution and be not subjected to the control or veto of any outside body. However, a rational procedure for the selection of teaching staff and for taking disciplinary action has to be evolved by the management itself.46 This proposition can be illustrated by reference to a few decided cases. A provision that no member of the staff of a college can be dismissed, removed or reduced in rank except after an inquiry at which the concerned person must be given a hearing is valid.47 A provision requiring the governing body of a private affiliated college to take disciplinary action (dismissal, removal, termination of service, or reduction in rank) against teachers on the recommendation of the University Service Commission, a statutory body, and subject to the approval of the University is violative of Art.",

    "content": "as it completely takes away the autonomy of the governing body of the college, and virtually vests control over the college staff in the Commission.48 The Andhra Pradesh Recognised Private Educational Institutions Control Act, 1975, provided that no teacher could be suspended except when an enquiry was contemplated into his gross misconduct. An order of suspension could not remain in force for more than two months; if the enquiry was not completed within that period, the teacher was to be restored without prejudice to the inquiry. The competent authority could extend the two months' period of suspension by two more months after recording the reasons in writing if in its opinion the inquiry could not be completed within the initial two months' period for reasons directly attributable to the teacher concerned. The provision was held valid because-- (a) it was regulatory in character; (b) it did not place an unreasonable restraint on the management's power to proceed against an erring teacher; and (c) the restraint imposed bore a reasonable nexus with the attainment of educational excellence and so it did not contravene Art. 30(1).49 The Andhra Act, mentioned above, also provided that no teacher employed in any educational institution would be dismissed, removed or reduced in rank except with the prior approval of the competent authority. The authority could approve of the management's proposal on being satisfied that there were 'adequate and reasonable' grounds for the proposal. The Supreme Court in All Saints High School50 held the provision invalid as it gave an unqualified mandate that no teacher could be dismissed without the prior approval of the competent authority. Contravention of this provision resulted in a total invalidation of the proposed action; it applied not only when the teacher was dismissed as a punishment but even when his service was terminated without any stigma or aspersion being attached to him. The competent authority was given an unguided discretion so as to make it a sole arbitrator of the question as to which cases would fall within the provision and which outside it. The authority was made the sole judge Page 55 of the propriety of the proposed action as it was for the authority itself to see whether there were reasonable grounds for the proposed action. \"Conferment of such a power or an outside power, the exercise of which is made to depend on purely subjective considerations arising out of the twin formula of adequacy and reasonableness, cannot but constitute an infringement of the right guaranteed by Art. 30(1).\" It may be interesting to note that this case reveals three strands of judicial thought. Kailasam, J., taking a narrow view of Art. 30(1) upheld all these provisions. Fazl Ali, J., adopting a very broad view of Art. 30(1) invalidated all the provisions. But the majority view invalidated the above provisions but upheld the provisions regarding suspension51 and retrenchment.52 Another provision in the Andhra Act conferred a right on the teacher dismissed, removed or reduced in rank, or whose appointment was otherwise terminated, or whose allowances or any condition of service altered to his disadvantage, to prefer an appeal to a prescribed authority. The provision was held invalid as it was too broadly worded because: appeal lay to 'any' authority regardless of its status or standing; appeal lay on all questions of fact and law, thereby throwing open the management's order to the unguided scrutiny and unlimited review of the appellate authority. A provision in the Kerala University Act laid down that a college teacher against whom disciplinary action was taken could appeal to the University Syndicate which could order his reinstatement in case of wrongful dismissal. The provision was held to be contradictory to Art. 30(1) as it took away the power of taking disciplinary action from the governing body and conferred it on the university.53 In Ahmedabad St. Xavier College,54 a provision requiring approval of the Vice-Chancellor for termination of a teacher's services was held as interfering with the minority institution's disciplinary control over the staff. The basic reason for this ruling was that there was no guideline provided in the impugned provision on the basis of which the approval was to be given or refused. The Vice-Chancellor had been given \"unlimited and undefined\" power.55 To the same effect is Lily Kurian v. St. Lewina.56 The power to take disciplinary action against a teacher was vested in the management of the institution, but subject to an appeal to the Vice-Chancellor by the teacher concerned. The Supreme Court held in the instant case that the appeal provision was violative of Art. 30(1) on the following grounds: Art. 30(1) cannot be a charter for maladministration and the minority right to manage an institution must be subject to the state regulatory power. But state regulation is permissible only to the extent the minority's right to administer may be better exercised for the benefit of the institution. \"But the moment one goes beyond that and imposes what is in truth, not a mere regulation but an impairment of the right to administer, the Art. comes into play and the interference cannot be justified by pleading the interests of the general public; the interests justifying the interference can only be the interests of the minority concerned.\" Otherwise, the minority's right to administer would be impaired. Conferring a right of appeal to the Vice-Chancellor takes away the disciplinary power of a minority educational management for a power of appeal carries with it the power to make appropriate orders including reinstatement. The power conferred in the instant case on the Vice-Chancellor is 'uncanalised and unguided' as there are no guidelines for exercising that power; the extent of the apellate power of the Vice-Chancellor not being defined are \"unlimited.\" Such a blanket power would directly interfere with the disciplinary control of the management of a minority educational institution over its teachers.",

    "content": "provision would so affect \"the disciplinary control of a minority educational institution as to be subversive of its constitutional rights and can hardly be regarded as a 'regulation' or a 'restriction' in the interest of the institution.\" In a number of other cases,57 a provision for enabling an aggrieved teacher to appeal to an outside authority against the disciplinary action taken by the management of a minority institution has been held to be violative of Art. 30(1). A provision in the Bihar Act provided, inter alia, that no teacher of a madarsa shall be discharged or dismissed from service without the prior approval of the State Madrasa Educational Board. The Supreme Court considered the provision as interfering with the management of the said school.58 Reference may be made in this connection to the decision of the Supreme Court in Yunus Ali Sha v. Mohamed Abdul Kalam.59S. 10A of the Orissa Education Act requires prior approval of the Director of Page 56 Education before termination of the services of a teacher of an aided institution. The Court has ruled that the provision would not apply to minority educational institutions. While the Directorate of Education may have power to supervise the functioning of the said school in order to ensure that it does not malfunction, or is not mal-administered, the Directorate has no control over the actual management of the school including hiring or terminating the services of teachers. This is because of Art. 30(1). Management of the school is entirely within the control of the Managing Committee of the minority institution. The management has full control over the appointment, termination and disciplinary action against the employees: This can be done without the prior approval of the Directorate unlike in the case of other aided educational institutions. In the instant case, therefore, because of \"the minority status of the educational institution, the Managing Committee of the institution was entitled to terminate the services of respondents 1 and 2 without obtaining prior approval of the Director or Inspector of Schools since the management and discipline of such an institution is entirely under the control of the Managing Committee of the minority institution.\"60 A provision in the Gujarat University Act contemplated reference of a dispute between the governing body and a staff member of a college connected with the conditions of his service to a tribunal of arbitration consisting of a member nominated by the college, one member nominated by the concerned staff member and an umpire appointed by the Vice-Chancellor. The provision was held non-applicable to minority colleges on the ground that reference to arbitration will introduce an area of litigious controversy inside the educational institutions; the domestic disciplinary jurisdiction of the college governing body would be displaced and a new jurisdiction created.61 Another provision in the Act said that no staff member of any college would be dismissed or reduced in rank without the approval of the Vice-Chancellor. This provision was also held invalid as conferring an unlimited and undefined power on the Vice-Chancellor who has been given a blanket power without any guidelines. A provision providing that if because of a government order, retrenchment of any teacher became necessary, the management could retrench a teacher with the prior approval of the competent authority was held valid as it aimed at affording a minimal guarantee of security of tenure to the teachers by eschewing the passing of mala fide orders in the garb of retrenchment. Power conferred on the competent authority was limited and guided as it was to see whether retrenchment was necessitated in fact by any government order and, therefore, it did not interfere with Art. 30(1).62 A regulation saying that a college teacher would not be disqualified to remain a teacher, merely because he had been elected a member of Parliament, State legislature or a local authority, was held to infringe Art. 30(1) as it would enable political parties to come into picture as regards the administration of minority institutions which would not like such an interference.63 In recent years, there have been a spate of cases having a bearing on the staff-management relationship in the minority institutions. The cumulative effect of these rulings seems to be to dilute to some extent the power of the management of such institutions as compared to the Lily Kurian ruling cited above.64 The judicial tendency seems to be in favour of giving some security to the staff as against the arbitrary action of the management of the minority institutions. In Frank Anthony Public School Employees' Association v. Union of India, 65 the Supreme Court has held that a statutory provision providing that where a managing committee of a recognised school intends to suspend any employee such intention should be communicated to the Director and no such suspension should be made except with the prior permission of the Director could be made applicable even to minority institutions. The Court has argued that the clause would not have been applicable to minority institutions if it had conferred a blanket power on the Director to grant or withhold prior approval in every case where the management proposes to suspend an employee. But it is not so in the instant case. The Court has observed: \"The management has the right to order immediate suspension of an employee in cases of gross misconduct but in order to prevent an abuse of power by the management a safeguard is provided to the employee that approval should be obtained within 15 days. The Director is also bound to accord his approval if there are adequate and reasonable grounds for such suspension. The provision appears to be eminently reasonable and sound.66 Page 57 Another provision interdicting that no employee of a recognised private school shall be dismissed, removed or reduced in rank except with the prior approval of the Director of Education has been held inapplicable to minority institutions.67 Further, the Court has ruled that the right guaranteed to minority institutions by Art.",

    "content": "provision appears to be eminently reasonable and sound.66 Page 57 Another provision interdicting that no employee of a recognised private school shall be dismissed, removed or reduced in rank except with the prior approval of the Director of Education has been held inapplicable to minority institutions.67 Further, the Court has ruled that the right guaranteed to minority institutions by Art. 30(1) is not invaded merely because a Tribunal is constituted under an Act to hear appeals against the order of dismissal, removal or reduction in rank of an employee in the service of a minority institution. The Tribunal is to be manned by a judicial officer and not by any departmental official. The right of appeal is confined to a limited class of cases, namely, those of dismissal, removal or reduction in rank and not to every dispute between an employee and the management. \"The limited right of appeal, the character of the authority constituted to hear the appeal and the manner in which the appellate power is required to be exercised make the provision for an appeal perfectly reasonable.\" Another provision requiring that the scales of pay and other perquisites of teachers in minority schools would not be less than those of the teachers in government schools was held as not detracting from the Fundamental Right guaranteed by Art. 30 to the minority educational institutions. For the maintenance of educational standards in such institutions it was essential that they were competently staffed. The Supreme Court has been propounding the view that while the right of the minorities, religious or linguistic, to establish and administer educational institutions \"of their choice\" could not be interfered with, restrictions by way of regulations for the purpose of ensuring educational standards and maintaining excellence thereof can validly be prescribed. Regulations can thus be made for ensuring proper conditions of service for the teachers and also for ensuring a fair procedure in the matter of disciplinary action. The endeavour of the court in all cases has been to strike a balance between the constitutional obligation to protect what has been secured to the minorities under Art. 30(1) and the social necessity to protect the members of the staff against arbitrariness and victimisation. Art. 30(1), the Court has emphasized, is \"not a charter for maladministration\". The Frank Anthony ruling has been reiterated by the Supreme Court in Mrs. Y. Theclamma v. Union of India.68S. 8(4)of the Delhi School Education Act,inter alia, provided that no employee shall be suspended without the approval of the Director of Education. The question was whether this provision would apply to minority institution or not. The principal of a Government aided minority school was suspended by the management pending an inquiry against her. She challenged her suspension. The Frank Anthony ruling holding the provision applicable to minority institutions was reiterated with the remark that the provision in question was designed to afford some measure of protection to the teachers of such institutions without interfering with the management's right to take disciplinary action. The Court has argued: \"A regulation which is designed to prevent maladministration of an educational institution cannot be said to infringe Art. 30(1).\" The Court has observed further: \"It cannot be doubted that although disciplinary control over the teachers of a minority educational institution is with the management, regulations can be made for ensuring proper conditions of service of teachers and also for ensuring a fair procedure in the matter of disciplinary action.\" A statutory provision providing that the managing committee of a minority institution shall have power to remove, terminate, dismiss or discharge a teacher with the approval of the Schools Service Board has been held to be valid as a regulatory provision for the administration of the minority institution.69 The provision required the managing committee of the school to frame regulations regarding the service conditions of the teachers based on natural justice and the prevailing law. As regards the power to dismiss or remove a teacher, the School Service Board enjoys only limited, and not unlimited, power in the matter; its only role is to ensure that the management has taken the disciplinary action in accordance with the rules framed by the managing committee for the purpose. On this point, the Court has observed:70 \"The School Service Board is not invested with any veto or blanket power without any guidance. On the other hand, it has limited power and guidelines are prescribed for the exercise of such powers. Such a provision is reasonable to ensure that rules framed by the minority school are followed and securing of employment of teachers is maintained and there be no arbitrary exercise of power.\" Page 58 The management of a minority educational institution dismissed a teacher. He appealed to the Educational Appellate Tribunal against his dismissal as provided for in the relevant State Act. The Tribunal allowed the appeal and ordered his reinstatement. The school management contended that being a minority institution, the provisions of the Act in question were not applicable to it and, therefore, the teacher had no right to appeal to the Tribunal. The Supreme court rejected the management's contention in the light of its earlier pronouncements in Frank Anthony and Theclamma mentioned above.71 The Supreme Court has ruled recently that if regulatory measures confers power on any specified authority, without indicating any guidelines for exercising of that power, then exercise of that power by the appropriate authority would offend Art. 14.",

    "content": "a regulation cannot be allowed to be retained as it would amount to an arbitrary inroad into the right of the minority72 in the matter of administration of the institution.73 In the words of the Court:74 \"In other words, if the regulatory provision conferring power on the educational authority is uncanalised and unguided and does not indicate any guidelines under which the educational authority could exercise the said power, then in such a case, the conferment of a blanket power on the educational authority would interfere with the right of control of the employer-minority institution in the matter of exercising disciplinary control over the employees of the institution\". In this way, the courts are now endeavouring to strike a balance between the constitutional obligation to protect what is secured to the employers under Art. 30(1) and the social necessity to protect staff members against arbitrariness and victimisation. In Christian Medical College Hospital v. Employees' Union, 75 the Supreme Court was called upon to decide an important question, viz., whether Ss. 9A, 10, 11A, 12 and 33 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, are applicable to educational institutions established and administered by the minorities which are protected by Art. 30(1) of the Constitution. Answering the question in the affirmative, the Court has pointed out that the Industrial Disputes Act has been passed with the twin object of preventing industrial disputes between employers and employees and settlement of such disputes. The argument of the minority institutions was that application of the Act would result in the abridgement of the right of management of minority educational institutions \"to administer such institutions\". The Court distinguished the St. Xavier College case from the present one insofar as in that case, the Act in question conferred a 'blanket' power on the Vice-Chancellor to approve or not to approve any recommendation made by the management regarding the dismissal, removal, reduction in rank or termination of service of a workman. The Act furnished no guidelines to the Vice-Chancellor regarding the exercise of that power. In the instant case, a reference has to be made by the Government either when both parties request the Government to refer an industrial dispute for adjudication or only when it is satisfied that there exists an industrial dispute. There are well laid out principles through a number of judicial decisions as to when an industrial tribunal can interfere with the decision of the management into an act of misconduct by an employee arrived at after a domestic enquiry. The Court has emphasized that there is need to balance the two interests, viz., the right of the minorities guaranteed under Art. 30(1) and the necessity for having a general law which regulates the relationship between employers and workmen. The court has emphasized that the guarantee of freedom to a minority institution under Art. 30(1) of the Constitution does not permit the minority institution to act contrary to law and order, law of contract, industrial laws or other general laws which are enacted for the welfare of the society. If the minorities' claim for immunity from the law of the land is upheld that would be unreasonable and against the interest of the minority institutions themselves. (g) SALARY OF TEACHERS In Frank Anthony,76 another significant question was raised. The salary scales prevalent in the government schools are higher but those in unaided minority schools are much lower. The Teachers' Union of the Frank Anthony Schools sought a declaration that this situation was discriminatory and sought its invalidation under Art. 14. Page 59 Section 12 of the Delhi School Education Act says that the grades prevalent in the government schools would not apply to unaided minority schools. On this question, theSupreme Court has observed that the excellence of the instruction provided in an institution depends directly on the quality and the contentment of the teaching staff. Conditions of service pertaining to minimum qualifications of teachers, their salaries, allowances and other conditions of service which ensure security, contentment and decent living standards to teachers will enable them to render better service to the institution and this cannot be regarded as violative of Art. 30(1). \"The management of a minority educational institution cannot be permitted under the guise of the Fundamental Right guaranteed by Art. 30(1) of the Constitution, to oppress or exploit its employees any more than any other private employee.\"77 Therefore, S. 12 has been declared invalid insofar as it has made government pay scales inapplicable to minority institutions as being \"clearly discriminatory\". The Court has also held valid another clause which requires the prior approval of the Director for dismissal, removal or reduction in rank of an employee of a minority school but making provision for an appeal to a Tribunal consisting of the District Judge. In other words minority institutions cannot exploit the teaching community.78 (h) ADMISSION OF STUDENTS The admission of students to educational institutions is also an aspect of administration. The Gujarat Government ordered that 80% of the seats in the teachers' training colleges be reserved for candidates deputed by the government. On refusal to comply with this direction, the recognition and grants-in-aid of a Christian institution were threatened to be withdrawn. The Supreme Court declared that the regulation under which the order in question was made violated Art. 30(1) as it made a serious inroad into the right of the minority to administer the college established by it. The regulation was imposed with a view not to make the institution as a more effective educational institution but rather in the general public interest and could not thus be regarded as reasonable. The Court has insisted that the right conferred by Art. 30(1) is intended to be a real right for the protection of the minorities in the matter of setting up of educational institutions of their own choice.",

    "content": "Court has insisted that the right conferred by Art. 30(1) is intended to be a real right for the protection of the minorities in the matter of setting up of educational institutions of their own choice. The right is intended to be effective and is not to be whittled down by regulative measures conceived in the interest not of the minority educational institution, but in the interest of the public or the nation as a whole. Only such regulation can be imposed as are directed to making the institution while retaining its character as a minority institution effective as an educational institution. The Court has observed in this connection:79 \"If every order which while maintaining the formal character of a minority institution destroys the power of administration is held justifiable because it is in the public or national interest, though not in its interest as an educational institution, the right guaranteed by Art. 30(1) will be but a 'teasing illusion'--a promise of unreality.\" In the specific fact situation of the instant case, the Court has said: \"Severe restrictions on right of private training college to admit students of Training College to admit students of their choice with a threat to withdraw recognition and to refuse to pay grant-in-aid in case of breach, is violative of Art. 30(1) of the Constitution.\" The Punjab and Haryana High Court has ruled that the students have no right under Art. 29(2) to be admitted to an aided and recognised minority educational institution on merit alone. Only on the four grounds mentioned in Art. 29(2), admission cannot be denied.80 The managers of a Roman Catholic Boys' School applied to the education authorities in Kerala for permission to admit girls as well. There was a Muslim Girls School in the locality, but the Christian community wanted its girls to receive education in its own school. Permission was refused on the ground that a girls school already existed nearby. The Supreme Court held in Mark Netto v. State of Kerala81 that because of the play of Art. 30, education authorities could not refuse permission to the Christian school to admit girls. If the Christian community wants its girls to be educated in its own school, and if it does not regard it in its interest to send the girls to a Muslim school, then denial of permission to do so would violate Page 60 Art. 30 as this would amount to interference with the administration of the institution run by a minority--a right guaranteed by Art. 30. The Court has also ruled in the instant case that the specific rule sanctioning such refusal of permission crosses the barrier of regulatory measures and falls in the region of interference with the administration of the institution--a right which is guaranteed to the minority under Art. 30(1). The Court has restricted the operation of the rule and has made it inapplicable to the minority educational institutions. The basic question which the Supreme Court was called upon to decide in St. Stephen's College v. University of Delhi, 82 was whether a minority institution has the right to admit candidates of the community which founded the college to maintain its minority character on a preferential basis, or reserve seats for them. Adopting a very liberal view of Art. 30(1), in a 4 to 1 decision, the Supreme Court has answered the question in favour of the minority institutions. First, the Court has clarified the criteria to determine the minority character of an institution. The Court has said in this connection:83 \"... there must exist some positive index to enable the educational institution to be identified with religious or linguistic minorities. Art. 30(1) is protective measure only for the benefit of religious and linguistic minorities and it is essential to make it absolutely clear that no ill-fit or camouflaged institution should get away with the constitutional protection.\" The Court has ruled that the St. Stephen's College was established and administered by a minority community, viz., the Christian community which is indisputably a religious minority in India as well as in the Union Territory of Delhi where the college is located and hence enjoys the status of a minority institution. On the question of admission of students of the concerned minority community, the Court has ruled that, according to Art. 30(1), the minorities whether based on religion or language have the right \"to establish and administer\" educational institutions of their choice, and the right to select students for admission is a part of administration. On this point, the Court has observed: \"It is indeed an important facet of administration. This power also could be regulated but the regulation must be reasonable just like any other regulation. It should be conducive to the welfare of the minority institution or for the betterment of those who resort to it.\" Thus, the right of the minority institution to admit students of its own community is a necessary concomitant right which flows from the right to establish and administer educational institutions in Art. 30(1). According to the directions issued by the University, students ought to be selected for admission on a uniform basis of marks secured in the qualifying examinations. But this system would deny the right of the college to admit students belonging to the Christian community. The college is, therefore, entitled to give some concession to the students of its own community. If these students are thrown into competition with the generality of the students belonging to other communities, they cannot be admitted at all. \"Unless some concession is provided to Christian students they will have no chance of getting into the college.\" For this purpose, the College has devised its own admission procedure according to which selection is made on the basis of the candidate's academic record and performance at the interview keeping in mind student's other characteristics. The Court has found the procedure quite valid.",

The Court has found the procedure quite valid. The Court has ruled: \"We are unable to accept the submission that the college Admission Programme is arbitrary and the University criterion for selection is objective.\" Dilating on the inter-relationship between Art. 29(2) and Art. 30(1), the Court has observed that Art. 29(2) is applicable to minorities as well as non-minorities but it does not mean that \"it was intended to nullify the special right guaranteed to minorities in Art. 30(1).\" Thus, the Court has accepted the right of the College to show some concession to the students of its own community subject, of course, in conformity with the University standard. And, also, that in no case such intake is to exceed 50% of the annual admission. A minority institution must make available at least 50% of the annual admission to members of communities other than the minority community. The admission of other community candidates has to be done purely on the basis of merit. Page 61 Kasliwal, J., in a dissenting opinion, has expressed the view that if the college is receiving aid out of state funds then it has to abide by the rigour of Art. 29(2) in the matter of admission of students.84 If the minorities want to run an education institution without the state grants they are free to admit students of their own community. But when they receive from the state funds which money comes from contributions by way of taxes from every citizen, then the minority institution has to fall in line with all other educational institutions and are not entitled to deny admission to any citizen on the ground of religion, race, caste, language or any of them. Kasliwal, J., had then warned:85 \"We cannot overlook that religious fundamentalism and linguistic parochialism leads to fissiparous tendencies and obstructs the national unity as a whole. It is necessary that minorities should join and be part and parcel of common stream of the country. Kasliwal J,'s view was reiterated by Variava & Bhan JJ but did not find favour with the majority in T.M.A. Pai. Kripal, C.J. speaking for the majority said: \"While, therefore, a minority educational institution receiving grant-in-aid would not be completely outside the discipline of Art. 29(2) of the Constitution, by no stretch of imagination can the rights guaranteed under Art. 30(1) be annihilated. It is in this context that some interplay between Art. 29(2) and Art. 30(1) is required.\"86 However, T.M.A Pai indicates an acceptability of greater regulation of aided and unaided minority institutions particularly in the matter of admissions and fees of professional colleges. 87 The decision in T.M.A. Pai led to a spate of litigation, of which many cases came up to the Supreme Court. The two issues which were normally raised related to admission and fees.88 The issues were considered in connection with professional institutions in Islamic Academy of Education89 and generally in P.A. Inamdar90. The result is that in the matter of admissions minority educational institutions can be required: (a) to observe inter se merit amongst the eligible minority applicants and passage of common entrance test by the candidates, where there is one, with regard to admissions in professional and non-professional colleges.91Islamic Academy of Education directed State Governments to appoint a permanent Committee which will ensure that the tests conducted by the association of colleges is fair and transparent. P.A. Inamdar's case while approving the setting up of the Committee directed that it should be temporary and subject to legislation in future; (b) to primarily cater to the requirements of that minority of the State in which it is located with only a \"sprinkling\" of that minority from another State where such community may not be a minority;92 Thus the Telugu Linguistic Minority in the State of Karnataka, could not claim minority status as it ignored the interest of the minority and opened admissions to the entire country by way of an open competition.93 (c) to admit students belonging to the minority to a reasonable extent only to ensure that its minority character is preserved and that the objective of establishing the institution is not defeated. What would be a reasonable extent, would vary with the types of institution, the courses of education for which admission is being sought and other factors like educational needs.1 The State Government concerned is to notify a reasonable percentage of the non-minority students to be admitted having regard to the type of institution, population and educational needs of minorities. Islamic Academy added that in case of any dispute as regards fixation of percentage of quota, it will be open to the management to approach the Committee.2 Islamic Academy's view that this power of percentage fixation was available to the State with regard to unaided educational institutions was overruled in P.A. Inamdar on the ground that it ran counter to T.M.A. Pai.3 (i) FEES There is also the question of fees chargeable by the unaided minority institutions from its students. It is clear that an unaided minority institution cannot be made to charge the same fees as an aided institution. The Page 62 reason is that unaided institutions have to meet the cost of imparting education from their own resources and the main source can only be the fees collected from the students. But these institutions cannot be permitted to indulge in commercialisation of education. Commercialisation of education cannot be permitted. The protection given to such institutions by Art. 30(1) is not intended to shield 'commercialised' activities by such institutions which are intended to reap rich dividends by holding education as a façade.4 The Delhi High Court has ruled5 that under Art.",

    "content": "these institutions cannot be permitted to indulge in commercialisation of education. Commercialisation of education cannot be permitted. The protection given to such institutions by Art. 30(1) is not intended to shield 'commercialised' activities by such institutions which are intended to reap rich dividends by holding education as a façade.4 The Delhi High Court has ruled5 that under Art. 30(1), the right to freely administer educational institutions does not permit the minorities to indulge in commercialisation of education in the garb of constitutional protection. No such institution has the right to maladminister the institution. The court has thus ruled that \"on the aspect of commercialisation and exploitation, minority institution would be similarly placed as other institutions\". Therefore, it would not be unconstitutional for the government to issue an order which places a restriction on the amount of fee chargeable by an institution, if, on facts, the minority institutions indulge in commercialisation of education and maladministration of the educational institutions.5 The unanimous view of all the judges in T.M.A. Pai was that unaided professional educational institutions (both minority and non-minority) cannot be regulated but no institution should charge capitation fee. Reasonable surplus to meet cost of expansion and augmentation of facilities does not, however, amount to profiteering.6 A Committee has been directed by Islamic Academy of Education to be set up to decide whether the fees proposed by an institute are justified and to approve the fee structure which can be charged by the institute. The fee fixed by the Committee shall be binding for a period of three years, at the end of which period the institute would be at liberty to apply for revision. The decision of the Committee is subject to judicial review.7 (j) MEDIUM OF INSTRUCTION The right of a minority to establish and administer educational institutions of its choice also carries with it the right to impart instruction in its institutions to its children in its own language. The result of reading Arts. 29(1) and 30(1) together is that the minority has the choice of medium of instruction and the power of the state to determine the medium of instruction has, therefore, to yield ground, to the extent it is necessary to give effect to this minority right. A rule prohibiting a minority to use the medium of instruction of its own choice constitutes a restriction of the minority's right to administer its own institutions. To hold otherwise will be to denude Arts. 29(1) and 30(1) of much of their content and the state should, therefore, use its power to determine the medium of instruction in such a manner as to effectuate minority right. Thus, a rule made by the Gujarat University prescribing Gujarati or Hindi as the sole medium of instruction and examination in its affiliated colleges was held to infringe the right of the Anglo-Indians under Art. 30(1) and 30(2) insofar as their mothertongue was English8 and they would be prevented thereby from teaching through the English medium in their own institutions. The most significant case on this point is the Panjabi University case.9 By a notification, the Punjab Government compulsorily affiliated certain colleges to the Punjabi Universitywhich prescribed Punjabi in the Gurmukhi script as the sole and exclusive medium of instruction and examination for certain courses. The Supreme Court declared that it violated the right of the Arya Samajists to use their own script in the colleges run by them and compulsorily affiliated to the University. The Court emphasized that if the University compulsorily affiliates minority colleges to itself and prescribes the medium of instruction and examination to be in a language which is not their mother tongue, or requires examination to be taken in a script which is not their own, then it would interfere with their Fundamental Rights. No linguistic minority can, of course, insist that a University must conduct its examinations in the language or script of the minority, but, at the same time, the University also cannot force the minority institutions to compulsorily affiliate themselves to it and impose on them a medium of instruction which is different from the minority's language or script. The State has to harmonise its power to prescribe the medium of instruction with the rights of the religious or linguistic minorities to have the medium of instruction and script of their own choice. The State can therefore either provide for instruction in the media of these Page 63 minorities, or allow their institutions to get affiliated to such other Universities outside the State as have the same media of instruction as the minority institutions. The Supreme Court observed in this connection:10 \"The University by adopting Punjabi as the sole or exclusive medium for the colleges affiliated to the University...acted in excess of the power conferred on it. While the University can prescribe Punjabi as a medium of instruction it cannot prescribe it as the exclusive medium nor compel affiliated colleges established and administered by linguistic or religious minorities or by a section of the citizens who wish to conserve their language, script or culture, to teach in Punjabi or take examinations in that language with Gurmukhi script. The University Act having compulsorily affiliated these Colleges must of necessity cater to their needs and allow them to administer their institutions in their own way and impart instructions in the medium and write examination in their own script...\" The Supreme Court has stated11 that while a State is free to provide for the education of the majority in the regional medium, it is subject to the restrictions contained in Arts. 25 to 30. The State cannot provide for imparting education in a medium of instruction in a language and script which stifles the language or script of any section of the citizens. Such a course will trespass on the rights of those sections of the citizens which have a distinct language or script and which they have a right to conserve through educational institutions of their own.",

    "content": "a course will trespass on the rights of those sections of the citizens which have a distinct language or script and which they have a right to conserve through educational institutions of their own. An order was issued dated July 20, 1982 by the Government of Karnataka making the study of Kannada language as a compulsory subject for the children belonging to linguistic minority groups in the State from the first year of the primary school. The Government order compelled the primary schools established by linguistic minorities to introduce Kannada as a compulsory subject from the first year of the primary school. The Government order also compelled the students joining high schools to take Kannada as the sole first language and also compelled the high schools established by the linguistic minorities to introduce Kannada as the sole first language in the secondary schools. The Karnataka High Court ruled in General Secretary, Linguistic Minorities Protection Committee v. State of Karnataka, 12 by a majority of 2 : 1, that the Government Order was violative of Arts. 14, 29(1) and 30(1). This view was reiterated recently by the Karnataka High Court13 which relied on the provisions of Art. 350-A of the Constitution to hold that in fact an obligation was cast upon every State and every local authority within the State to provide adequate facilities for instruction in the mother tongue at the primary stage of education to children belonging to linguistic minority groups. (k) ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY OF A MINORITY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION The Constitution Forty-fourth Amendment enacted in 1978 added Art. 30(1A) to the Constitution which runs as follows: \"In making any law providing for the compulsory acquisition of any property of an educational institution established and administered by a minority, referred to in clause (1), the State shall ensure that the amount fixed by or determined under such law, for the acquisition of such property is such as would not restrict or abrogate the right guaranteed under that clause.\" Article 30(1A) became necessary because Art. 31 was being abrogated from the Constitution.14 The above clause previously existed as a proviso to Art. 31(2). The State has a right to acquire property belonging to a minority institution. This provision seeks to protect minority rights somewhat in this regard but the actual implications of Art. 30(1A) are not clear. Does it mean that the State is to give adequate compensation for the property acquired? The Supreme Court has now commented on the scope of Art. 30(1A) in Society of St. Joseph's College v. Union of India.15 The Court has pointed out that Art. 30(1A) has been introduced in the Constitution because Parliament in its constituent capacity16 apprehended that minority educational institutions could be compelled to close down or curtail their activities by the expedient of acquiring their property and paying them inadequate amounts as compensation. Page 64 The Court has emphasized that Art. 30(1A) requires that Parliament or a State Legislature, as the case may be, ought to make a specific law to provide for the compulsory acquisition of the property belonging to minority educational institutions. The provisions of this law should be such as would ensure that the amount payable to the educational institution for the acquisition of its property will not in any manner impair the functioning of the educational institution. The general law viz.the Land Acquisition Act is not adequate for the purpose of acquiring the property of minority educational institutions. Because the question of determining compensation for acquiring such property will have to take into account several factors which do not come into play while determining amounts payable for acquisition of other property. * ED: The decision of eleven Judges in T.M.A. Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka, (2002) 8 SCC 481 was delivered immediately before the last revision of the book. It was therefore treated separately. The present edition has included the development in the law effected by the case under the appropriate heads. The separate sections dealing with the case in the earlier edition have therefore been omitted. 1. Per Kripal C.J., T.M.A. Pai Foundation v.

Mukharji, J., quashed the government order on the simple ground that in the facts and circumstances of the case, it was action \"without reason\" and \"an act of arbitrariness\". He did not wish to invoke Art. 30 as there was no allegation that affiliation was being denied to the institution on the ground that it was a minority institution. There was no discrimination as such against the institution on the ground of its minority character. \"It was inaction or an act of arbitrariness on the part of the authorities.\" He thus decided the matter by applying the principles of Administrative Law rather than of Constitutional Law. 6.

INTRODUCTORY The Constitution (Forty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1978, constitutes a watershed in the evolution of the Fundamental Right to Property in India. Truly speaking, this Amendment signifies demise of the Fundamental Right to Property. Before 1978, there existed mainly two Articles to protect private property, viz., Arts. 19(1)(f) and 31. Both these constitutional provisions were repealed by this Constitutional Amendment, and, thus, left private property defenceless against legislative onslaught. The present Chapter focusses on Arts. 19(1)(f) and 31 as they existed before 1978. This Chapter is thus primarily of historical value and it puts the continual devaluation of the right to property since the inauguration of the Constitution in a historical perspective. The present position in the area of property rights is discussed in the following Chapter. It may not be out of place to mention that the natural law jurists regarded protection to property, alongwith life and liberty of a person, as being of paramount necessity in a free society.",

    "content": "present position in the area of property rights is discussed in the following Chapter. It may not be out of place to mention that the natural law jurists regarded protection to property, alongwith life and liberty of a person, as being of paramount necessity in a free society. It is for this reason that the U.S. Constitution in the V Amendment ordains : \"No person can be deprived of his life, liberty or property without due process of life\". In India, on the other hand, the policy-makers under the impact of the socialist philosophy started devaluing the institution of private property almost from the very day the Constitution came into force. In Independent India, no Fundamental Right has caused so much trouble, and has given rise to so much litigation between the government and the citizen, as the right to property. While the Supreme Court has sought to expand the scope and ambit of many Fundamental Rights, including the right to property, this right has been progressively curtailed through constitutional amendments.1 Although, originally, the Constitution contained adequate provisions to protect private property, and although the Supreme Court sought to interpret these constitutional provisions liberally in favour of the protection to the institution of property, the fact remains that the right to property has practically ceased to exist in India. Some of the locusclassicus cases in Indian Constitutional Law have arisen in the area of property rights. The reason for such a development is that the Central and State Governments have enacted massive legislation to regulate property rights. First, the government undertook to reconstruct the agrarian economy, inter alia, by trying to confer rights of property on the tiller, abolition of zamindaris, giving security of tenure to tenants, fixing a ceiling on personal holding of agricultural land and redistributing the surplus land among the landless. Secondly, in the area of urban property, measures have been initiated to provide housing to the people, clearance of the slums and town planning, control rents, acquire property and impose a ceiling on urban land ownership, etc. Thirdly, the government has undertaken regulation of private enterprise and nationalization of some commercial undertakings. These various legislative measures have been undertaken to effectuate some of the Directive Principles of Page 72 State Policy2 as well as to usher in the accepted goal of establishing a socialist pattern of society in India.3 These multifarious measures concerning property have led to the uprooting of vested interests and property rights on a large scale. Consequently, in a large number of cases, legislation came to be challenged before the courts. The most significant controversy in these cases was the question of payment of compensation for the property right acquired. Important constitutional battles have been fought around this question and the Constitution has been amended several times to get over some inconvenient judicial rulings.4 So much bitterness has been generated in relation to property rights that while, at times, on the one hand, demands have been made to abolish the Fundamental Right to property, on the other hand, it has been asserted that property rights are essential for the survival of a democratic society, and that the dilution of property right has defaced and defiled the Constitution.5 Two trends, rather inconsistent, hold out in this area. On the one hand, generally speaking, the Courts have leaned towards protecting property rights and payment of adequate compensation for property rights acquired by the state. On the other hand, the state has progressively, by amending the Constitution, reduced the occasions when compensation is payable for disturbance of property rights and has sought to minimise intervention by the courts in this area. The action and interaction thus produced between legislative and judicial processes form an extremely fascinating Chapter in India's constitutional development, so much so that the enactment of the First and the Seventeenth Amendments curtailing property rights even led to the raising of the critical question of the amendability of the Constitution itself.6 EMINENT DOMAIN It is regarded as an inherent right of the state, an essential incident of its sovereignty, to take private property for public use. This power, known as Eminent Domain, depends on the superior domain of the state over all property within its boundaries; it is supposed to be based upon an implied reservation by the state that property acquired by its citizens under its protection may be taken, or its use controlled, for public benefit irrespective of the wishes of the owner. An incident of this power, however, is that property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation.7 The power of eminent domain has been described by the U.S. Supreme Court thus: when public need requires acquisition of property, the need is not to be denied because of an individual's unwillingness to sell. When the need arises, individuals may be required to relinquish ownership of property so long as they are given just compensation which the Constitution requires.8 The power of eminent domain can, therefore, be defined as the power of the state to take property for public use, without the owner's consent upon making just compensation to him. The two essential ingredients of eminent domain are: (1) property is taken for public use; (2) compensation is paid for the property taken. In the U.S.A., compensation is payable for 'taking' the property9 which does not necessarily mean vesting of possession or ownership in the government. If regulation of a property right goes too far, it may be recognised by the courts as 'taking' and compensation may become payable.",

    "content": "observed by Justice Holmes:10 \"The general rule at least is that while property may be regulated to certain extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognised as a taking.\" Thus, in United States v. Causley, 11 it was held that the respondent's property was 'taken' by regular and frequent flights of army and navy aircraft over his land at low attitude which did depress the value of the land.12 The question of compensation is justiciable as it is a question of a constitutional right. In Britain, on the other hand, the rule is that, unless Parliament explicitly provides to the contrary, it must be assumed that any legislation authorising compulsory acquisition of property intends to provide full compensation.13 The Indian version of eminent domain is to be found in entry 42, List III, which says \"acquisition or requisitioning of property\".14 In Kameshwar,15 the Supreme Court emphasized that the power to acquire Page 73 property compulsorily meant power to take property for a public purpose and for compensation. The Court defined eminent domain as \"the power of the sovereign to take property for public use without the owner's consent upon making just compensation\". The ideas of 'public purpose' and 'compensation' are thus inherent in entry 42.16 To start with, the Constitution had Art. 19(1)(f) and Art. 31 to protect property rights. In course of time, Art. 31 came to be modified drastically through several constitutional amendments. Ultimately, in 1978, by the Constitution 44th Amendment, Arts. 19(1)(f) and 31 were abrogated. Although these provisions have lost their relevance after the 44th Amendment, nevertheless, a brief discussion on these provisions is included here in view of the importance of the subject. This discussion is necessary to understand the genesis, and appreciate the implication, of the existing provisions relating to property. Also, since the 44th Amendment is not retrospective,17 and Arts. 19(1)(f) and 31 have been deleted with effect from June 20, 1979, all laws enacted earlier are still subject to these Articles. Arts. 31A, 31B and 31C as well as Art. 300A are the existing constitutional provisions concerning private property. Art. 300A has been added by the 44th Amendment.18 B. ARTICLES 19(1)(f) AND 19(5) Until 1978, Art. 19(1)(f) existed in the Constitution which gave a modicum of protection to private property. Art. 19(1)(f) was repealed by the 44th Constitution Amendment and Art. 300A was introduced in the Constitution in its place. This move has very much diluted constitutional protection to the institution of private property in India. Although repealed, the following discussion on Art. 19(1)(f) has been included here for its historical interest. Article 19(1) (f) guaranteed to the Indian citizens a right to acquire, hold and dispose of property. Art. 19(5), however, permitted the state to impose by law reasonable restrictions on this right in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe. A few words in these provisions need some explanation. 'To acquire' means, in common parlance, to become the owner of. Unless there is a transfer of property to another, or vesting and divesting of property, there cannot be any acquisition of property. The acquisition must, however, be through legal means. Thus, a thief who steals property, or a usurper of another's property, or one who cannot justify in law his acquisition, would not be protected by Art. 19(1)(f). The term 'to hold' means to possess the property and enjoy the benefits which are ordinarily attached to its ownership including its management. 'To dispose of' means to transfer, assign or sell the property. The power to dispose of property is a necessary concomitant of the power to hold property, for the latter would be meaningless without the former. (a) PROPERTY What is the meaning of the term 'property'? Generally speaking, the word 'property' has a very broad connotation, and is indicative and descriptive of every possible interest which a person can have. Not only the thing which is the subject-matter of ownership, but even dominium, or the right of ownership, possession, etc., fall within the scope of this term. To begin with, the courts sought to interpret the term 'property' in Art. 19(1)(f) somewhat restrictively in order to limit the guarantee thereunder. In Chiranjit Lal v. India, 19 the right of voting enjoyed by the shareholders of a company, or their right to select the directors, or their right to pass resolutions, or institute winding up proceedings, were held to be not 'property'. A share in a joint stock company was 'property' but these rights or privileges were appurtenant to, or flowed from, the ownership of the share, and \"by themselves and taken independently they cannot be reckoned as property capable of being acquired, held or disposed of.\" These rights were characterised as 'personal rights'. It was stated that for purposes of Art. 19(1)(f), property was that which could by itself be acquired, disposed of or taken possession of. This restrictive view would appear to strike at the root of the protection of incorporeal rights. Further, the right Page 74 of management of a company was ordinarily vested in the shareholders; and as management was an important incident of holding property, the right to hold property was affected if right of management was affected. Further, by regulating the right of management, the right to the property, i.e., the share, was also affected from another point of view, viz., undoubtedly, the value of the share must fall, and so the matter could still be brought under Art. 19(1)(f). In State of West Bengal v. Subodh, Gopal,20 Sastri, C.J., propounded the theory that Art. 19(1)(f) dealt only with the natural rights inherent in a citizen to acquire, hold, dispose of property in the abstract without any reference to any particular property; that Art. 19(1)(f) concerned only with the abstract right and capacity to hold, acquire and dispose of property and had no relation to concrete property rights.",

    "content": "dealt only with the natural rights inherent in a citizen to acquire, hold, dispose of property in the abstract without any reference to any particular property; that Art. 19(1)(f) concerned only with the abstract right and capacity to hold, acquire and dispose of property and had no relation to concrete property rights. In other words, the Article forbade the state to deny to particular individuals, or classes of individuals, the right to own property, but did not protect a citizen's interest in a particular piece of property or business from state interference. Jagannadha Das, J., protested against this view. He stated there that to construe Art. 19(1)(f) as not referring to concrete property rights would enable the legislature to impose unreasonable restrictions on the enjoyment of concrete property interests. In course of time, the Supreme Court, to some extent, moved away from the restrictive view of property. In Dwarka v. Sholapur Mills, 21 Das, J., held specifically that the mills, machinery, stock, etc., were property as also contract or agreement which a person might have with another. The term 'property' was given a broad meaning in Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments v. Lakshmindra, 22 where the Supreme Court observed that there was no reason why the word 'property' as used in Art. 19(1)(f) should not be extended to those well recognised types of interests which have the characteristics of proprietary rights and that Art. 19(1)(f) \"applies equally to concrete as well as abstract rights of property\". In the instant case, therefore, the office of a mahant of a math was held to be a proprietary right as in the conception of mahantship, both the elements of office and property, of duties and personal interest, are blended together and neither can be detached from the other. A mahant is entitled to enjoy the property or the beneficial interest so long as he is entitled to hold his office, and to take away the beneficial interest and leave him merely to discharge his duties would be to destroy the character of a mahant altogether. The reasonableness of restrictions placed upon him could, therefore, be judged under Art. 19(1)(f). If, however, the holder of a religious office in a temple does not have any personal beneficial interest in the properties of the temple, then the office cannot be regarded as property.23 A mutwalli of a Muslim wakf differs from a mahant, for he has purely a right of management of the property but no interest in the property as such. His duties are merely of a secular nature. Art. 19(1)(f) was not, therefore, applicable to a mutwalli.24 A trustee administering trust property for the benefit of a beneficiary has no right to property, but the beneficiary has such a right and he could, therefore, invoke Art. 19(1)(f).25 Interference by the government with the bare right of management of an institution did not infringe property right under Art. 19(1)(f). Accordingly, a law dissolving the existing board of management of a registered society, and appointing another board instead, did not infringe Art. 19(1)(f), for the board had no interest in the society's property.26 Business is property and so a restriction on business could be tested under Art. 19(1)(f) read with Art. 19(5) as well as Art. 19(1)(g) read with Art. 19(6). This, however, made no difference in practice for the ambit of Art. 19(6) being broader, whatever was valid under it was also valid under Art. 19(5).27 Right to a sum of money is property.28 A right to get pension is property as the right accrues from the service rules and is not a bounty payable on the sweet will and pleasure of the government.29 Privy purses payable to the ex-rulers prior to 1971 were held to be property.30 Article 19(1) (f) did not protect a mere contractual right or a licence as it did not create an interest in property.31 A right to carry away forest produce, like timber or tendu leaves, was a mere licence and would not fall within the protection of Art. 19(1)(f). A profit-a-prendre is property; the interest of a tenant in the demised property was held to be property for purposes of Art. 19(1)(f),32 but not a statutory right to apply for the purchase of land, and so it fell outside Art. 19(1)(f).33 Page 75 The Supreme Court ruled definitively that Art. 19(1)(f) applied equally to concrete as well as to abstract rights of property. The Court stated, \"To suggest that abstract rights of a citizen in property cannot be infringed by the State but his concrete rights can be, is to deprive Art. 19(1)(f) of its real content.\"34 In M.M. Pathak v. Union of India, 35 it was held that 'property' within the meaning of Art. 19(1)(f) [as well as Art. 31(2)]36 comprised every form of property, tangible or intangible, including debts and choses in action. (b) RESTRICTIONS The expression \"interest of general public\" in Art. 19(5) was held synonymous with \"public interest\". It did not mean the interest of the public of the whole of India; it meant interest of a \"section of the public\" and, thus, a law affecting a limited class of persons in a local area could well be legislation in the public interest. The removal of a serious abuse, grievance, discontent or hardship of a particular class was a matter of public interest for it was not in public interest to allow any class of people to labour under some grievance.37 The term 'public interest' was very broad and was held to include public order, public health, morality, etc. Whether a piece of legislation was in public interest or not was a justiciable matter. A law designed to abate a grave nuisance and thus protect public health,38 or a law to protect the weaker sections of the public, especially members of low castes,39 was held to be in public interest.",

A law designed to abate a grave nuisance and thus protect public health,38 or a law to protect the weaker sections of the public, especially members of low castes,39 was held to be in public interest. The Bombay Legislature levied a tax on owners of residential buildings, the proceeds of which were to be spent on the repairs of dilapidated and dangerous buildings. It was argued that the scheme of taxation provided bounties to such house owners as had neglected to maintain their buildings properly and this was not a public purpose. The Supreme Court, however, held the tax to be for a public purpose. Many residential buildings collapsed for want of repairs affecting poor people residing therein. The law sought to ameliorate the condition of these people. The Court emphasized that the ultimate and not the immediate purpose of expenditure of tax money determined its nature. The test was not as to who received the money but what was the character of the purpose for which it was to be spent.40 A restriction to be 'reasonable' must not be excessive or arbitrary.41 A few examples may be cited here to indicate how the courts adjudicated upon the reasonableness of restrictions under Art. 19(5). Seizure of goods from the possession of a citizen by the police without authority of law infringed Art. 19(1)(f).42 If the government acquired an undertaking, either its purchase price should be paid immediately, or interest should be paid on the price from the date of acquisition till the date of payment. To defer payment of purchase price, and not to pay interest on it, constituted an unreasonable restriction under Art. 19(5).43 Certain restrictions were imposed by the Gold Control Act on pawnbrokers of gold and gold ornaments. A breach of any of these conditions could have resulted in the confiscation of the gold found in his possession, or he could be liable to a fine twice the value of the gold. TheSupreme Court held these punishments to be unduly harsh and, therefore, unreasonable.44 Under the Electricity Act, 1910, a non-licensee could engage in the business of supplying electricity with the sanction of the State Government subject to such conditions as it could impose. A condition imposed by the government was that of compulsory acquisition of the assets of the supplier on payment of proper compensation on termination of the sanction. The condition was held to be reasonable.45 The provision in the Sea Customs Act laying down that if a public officer seizes gold, diamonds, cigarettes, cosmetics in reasonable belief that these are smuggled goods then the burden to prove that they are not smuggled falls on the person from whose possession the goods have been seized was held valid, forex facie it enacts a rule of evidence, its ratio being that the person in possession of gold, etc., would be in a better position to prove that it was legally within the country than the customs authorities. The provision has been made to check wide-spread smuggling which if not checked would undermine national economy and so was held to be in the interest of the general public. The words 'reasonable belief' prescribe a condition precedent to the application of the provision against any person and the question whether the seizing officer entertained such a reasonable belief could be objectively determined by the adjudicating authority.46 Page 76 A Bombay Act created a labour welfare fund and asked the employees to pay into it all unpaid wages due to the employees. The provision was held to be invalid for it was taking away the employer's property (i.e., money) without compensation and without discharging him from his obligation to the unpaid employees.47 Legislation controlling accommodation and rents in urban areas, and imposition of drastic restrictions on the right of the landlords to evict their tenants,48 the Administration of Evacuee Property Act which imposed drastic restrictions on evacuee property,49 restrictions imposed by the Punjab Customary Law on the alienation of ancestral land,50 limitations imposed on owners of land to construct,51 provisions for registration of religious endowment,52 were all held valid with reference to Art. 19(1)(f). Generally speaking, Art. 19(1)(f) did not prove to be much of a hindrance in the way of the government programme implementing agricultural land reforms. Courts characterised as reasonable a very drastic re-ordering of the agrarian economy showing that the courts themselves had assimilated and imbibed, and were influenced by, the contemporary economic philosophy. Many laws regulating relationship between landlord and tenants were declared to be constitutional.53 A law preventing ejectment of a tenant from his holding by a landholder was held valid for the object of such a law was to ensure to the actual tiller some fixity of tenure.54 Further, under Art. 19(1)(f), a landholder had only a right to recover reasonable rent from his cultivating tenants and, therefore, a law fixing fair and equitable rent did not invade the right to hold and enjoy property, even when the law had retrospective effect, for whatever was reasonable for the future was also so for the past.55 A law promoting consolidation of holdings,56 a law limiting the size of holdings in the hands of a single individual to a specified limit,57 was each held to be valid. The law of pre-emption imposed restrictions on the right of the vendee to acquire and hold property, and on the right of the vendor to dispose of his property to whomsoever he pleased. It was a clog on the freedom of sale, and diminished the market value of the property. For sometime after the commencement of the Constitution, there was a difference of opinion among the High Courts on the question of constitutional validity of the right to pre-emption. The right of pre-emption of urban property by vicinage was held to be unreasonable because it raised litigation and was not in the interest of the general public.",

    "content": "sometime after the commencement of the Constitution, there was a difference of opinion among the High Courts on the question of constitutional validity of the right to pre-emption. The right of pre-emption of urban property by vicinage was held to be unreasonable because it raised litigation and was not in the interest of the general public. The real reason behind the law which was introduced during the Muslim rule, was to prevent strangers, i.e., people belonging to different religion, race or caste, from acquiring property. Such a division of society into groups, and exclusion of strangers from any locality, could not be considered reasonable under Art. 19(5). The right of pre-emption in favour of a co-sharer was held to be valid as introduction of a stranger would make management of the property extremely difficult and would destroy the benefit of ownership in common. Similarly, the right of pre-emption in the owners of properties sharing a common staircase or entrance was held valid.58 In case of agricultural property, a provision permitting members of the family of the vendor, e.g., those who would have succeeded to the property if no sale had been made, to pre-empt a sale was sustained under Art. 19(1)(f), for it sought to implement the agnatic rule of succession and avoided fragmentation of holdings.59 Thus, the Supreme Court ruled that the right of pre-emption based on consaguinity did not infringe Art. 19(1)(f). But in Atam Prakash v. State of Haryana, 60 the Supreme Court held such a right as being inconsistent with Art. 14, characterising it as \"a relic of the feudal past\" and \"inconsistent with modern ideas.\" Right of pre-emption in favour of tenants has however been held invalid. Normally, a provision depriving people retrospectively of the property rights which had become vested in them before the enactment of the law in question was regarded as unreasonable.61 But there could be exceptional circumstances when such a law was held valid. Thus, an evacuee property law which rendered prior transactions in respect of evacuee property ineffective unless confirmed by the custodian was held reasonable because of the situation prevailing in the country at the time.62 Taxing statutes were not immune from being challenged under Art. 19(1)(f), though, in practice, it was only rarely that such a statute would be characterised as unreasonable. The general principle was that levy of a tax, within the competence of the legislature concerned, did not ordinarily infringe Art. 19(1)(f).63 But a taxing statute which was discriminatory, or provided no procedural machinery for assessment of the tax, or where Page 77 the tax was confiscatory in nature, was struck down as unconstitutional.64 Kerala imposed a land tax. The Act authorised the government to make a provisional assessment in respect of the land held by a person. But the Act made no provision for issue of notice to the assessee, or submission of a return by him, or any appeal against the assessment order. Tax assessment procedure was of an administrative character and ignored the well-established principle that a tax assessment was of a quasi-judicial nature. This was held as imposing an unreasonable restriction on the right to hold property under Art. 19(1)(f). The tax was also held to be confiscatory, as the petitioner in the instant case was required to pay a tax of Rs. 50,000 per year on his property from which he secured an income only of Rs. 3,100 per year.65 Explaining the effect of the Moopil Nair case, the Supreme Court stated in later cases that a tax could not be challenged merely on the ground that the tariff imposed was high or heavy, but where a tax statute was of a colourable nature, i.e., where the legislature used taxation as a device or cloak to confiscate the property taxed, then it could be held unreasonable as being confiscatory.66 Levy of a profession tax and a procedure for its assessment were held valid.67 Increase in the licence fee on cinema shows from Rs. 400 to 6000 a year was held to be non-expropriatory when according to its seating capacity, a cinema could collect Rs. 1000 per show.68 A provision in the Income-tax Act treating a loan by a company to one of its share-holders as dividend and hence subject to income-tax was held to be not unreasonable.69 Another provision in the same Act provided that in computing the total income of any individual for the purpose of assessment of the tax, the income of his wife and minor child from their membership in the firm of which the individual was a partner was to be included in the income of the individual himself. This was challenged as unreasonable on the ground that the individual was being made to pay tax on the income of another, and that he had to pay tax at a higher rate on his own income than he would have to pay if the income of his wife or minor son were not added. Nevertheless, the provision was held reasonable because its object was to prevent evasion of tax by an individual doing business under a partnership nominally entered into with his wife and minor children.70 Retrospectivity by itself did not make a tax unreasonable, though it was a consideration to be kept in view while adjudging the reasonableness of a tax measure.71The Madras Legislature levied an urban land tax with effect from July 1, 1963. The Act was declared invalid in 1966. The Legislature then passed a validating Act with effect from the original date. The retrospective operation of the tax in such circumstances was held not bad.72 Imposition of a tax on lands and buildings without the authority of law, or not in accordance with law, could never be valid.73 (c) ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRETION TO INTERFERE WITH PROPERTY The validity of statutory provisions conferring discretionary powers on administrative officers to interfere with private property was also tested with reference to Art. 19(5).",

Speaking generally, the courts did not take kindly to conferment of absolute discretion on administrative officers uncabined by any procedural safeguards. At the minimum, right of hearing to the party affected was insisted upon as an essential safeguard,74 but, at times, courts insisted that the statute should incorporate some substantive norms to regulate administrative discretion to interfere with property. Under a law, the Deputy Commissioner (acting as the Court of Wards) could, in his subjective determination, assume the superintendence of property of a landlord who habitually infringed the rights of the tenants. The discretion so conferred could not be called into question in any civil court. The law was held unreasonable for it deprived the landlord of his property for an indefinite period merely on the subjective satisfaction of an executive officer without giving him a right to take recourse to a civil court.75 On the other hand, a legal provision empowering the municipal commissioner to make a clearance order was held valid because the tenants affected by such an order had a right to file objections against the order, and they could also appeal to a civil court.76 Page 78 An administrative order imposing a cut in superannuation pension of a civil servant without giving him an opportunity to show cause against it was held not valid.77 A law authorising the reclamation officer to declare any land as kans infested and to enter and start reclamation operations therein without giving any opportunity to the landowner to show that his land was not really so infested was held to be void because the absence of the right of hearing to the landowner made the provision arbitrary.78 Power given to the Commissioner to take over the administration of a religious endowment for five years, was held invalid as 'extremely drastic in character', because no access was allowed to the court to set aside the order. But a provision authorising the Commissioner to pass any order which he deemed necessary to ensure that an endowment was properly administered and its income duly appropriated for the purpose for which it was founded, was held not unreasonable, for some amount of control over the due administration of the endowments was certainly necessary in the interests of the public.79 Similarly, power given to the Commissioner to make an inquiry into or try the charges against the mahant and order his removal if such charges were established had been held to be valid as it was subject to a few safeguards: (1) proceedings before the Commissioner were quasi-judicial; (2) order of removal could be challenged in a court; (3) an appeal could be taken to the High Court, and (4) the grounds for removal were specified in the Act.80 An Act authorised an administrative officer to evict a person occupying any government premises if the officer was satisfied that he was in unauthorised occupation of the premises. Before making the order, the affected person was to be given an adequate opportunity to tender an explanation and produce evidence in his support. He could then appeal to the State Government against the order, but could have no recourse to the courts. The Act was held valid because of adequate procedural safeguards contained therein.81 A law making the right of disposal of property subject to the uncontrolled discretion of an administrative officer was regarded as bad. The most fundamental element of ownership being the right to alienate. Therefore, to be valid, the law should contain guidelines for the exercise of the administrative discretion.82 A law conferred on administrative authorities the power to acquire fisheries as well as the power to decide the amount of compensation payable for the property acquired. The authorities were to act in a quasi-judicial manner in deciding the amount of compensation, but the jurisdiction of the courts was excluded in this matter. The law was found to be not unreasonable because the concerned authorities were still to be subject to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the High Courts under the relevant constitutional provisions.83 A law authorised the State Government to acquire any movable property if it considered 'necessary and expedient' to do so and pay such compensation as it might determine. It was held void because it gave arbitrary power to the government; it contained no guidelines regarding the purpose and object for which the property could be acquired; it did not even say that the property was to be acquired for a public purpose.84 The Bombay Town Planning Act, 1954, made elaborate provisions for formulation of town planning schemes. Under the Act, the petitioners were allotted a piece of land which was nearly half of what had been taken away from them, and they were also required to pay a sum of money as increment in the value of land. The petitioner challenged the Act inter alia on the ground that it vested arbitrary powers in administrative officers and, thus, infringed Art. 19(1)(f). The Supreme Court, however, upheld the Act as valid for it contained elaborate substantive and procedural provisions for formulation of the plans. The draft plan had to be publicized; objections received against the plan had to be considered by the concerned authorities; many decisions of the town planning officers had been made appealable to a tribunal consisting of a civil judge and two assessors. The Act thus imposed only reasonable restrictions on the right to hold and enjoy property.85 Under an Act, when government auctioned land and full consideration was not paid for it, unpaid money constituted the first charge on the auctioned property.",

    "content": "Act thus imposed only reasonable restrictions on the right to hold and enjoy property.85 Under an Act, when government auctioned land and full consideration was not paid for it, unpaid money constituted the first charge on the auctioned property. The auction purchaser was further prohibited from creating any third party right in the land until the unpaid amount was fully paid. Further, the government had power to forfeit the whole or part of the money paid in case of non-payment of the rest of the consideration money and there was no relief against forfeiture. Under the ordinary law of the land, it was open to the government to enforce the charge and recover the money due. The fact that government had two alternative Page 79 remedies, without there being any thing in the Act to guide the exercise of power by the government as to when and how one of the remedies would be chosen, amounted to discrimination. In such cases, government may discriminate by proceeding against one person in one manner and against another person in another manner. The Court ruled that it was an unreasonable restriction on the enjoyment of property to forfeit the money paid and resume the land for default in payment.86 The Slum Areas (Improvement and Clearance) Act, 1956, provided that a court decree of eviction of a tenant from any building in a slum area could not be executed without the written permission of the competent authority who would grant or refuse such permission after hearing the parties concerned. The provision was held valid because the discretion vested in the authority was not unguided. Rules for his guidance could be gathered from the policy and purpose of theAct as set out in the preamble and operative provisions. The restriction imposed on the right of property was not excessive and it had a reasonable and rational relation with the object of the Act which was the ultimate elimination of slums with protection to the slum dwellers in the meantime.87 S. 132 of the Income-tax Act authorised the Director of Inspection or the Commissioner to order search of any building if he had reason to believe that an assessee would not produce his books of account or had in his possession assets which he had not disclosed for purposes of income taxation. The books of accounts or assets found on the premises could be seized by the authorised officer. The provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code were made applicable to such searches. The provision was held not invalid under Art. 19(1)(f) as it was directed against those who were believed on good grounds to have illegally avoided payment of the tax. A search by itself did not constitute restriction on the right to hold or enjoy property. Seizure was only a temporary interference with property right for the limited purpose of investigation. S. 132 had several inbuilt safeguards making it less onerous and restrictive, e.g., power to order search and seizure was vested in high officials and they had to entertain reasonable belief with respect to matters laid down in the Act before ordering search and seizure.88 Interference with the right of property merely by executive action without there being a law for the purpose constituted an infringement of Art. 19(1)(f). Similarly, an order affecting property but not in accordance with law was invalid.89 The above discussion shows that, on the whole, courts did extend protection to private property against administrative interference. In assessing reasonableness of restrictions on property rights, courts were influenced by the prevailing politico-economic and sociological views, as for example, they conceded a good deal of flexibility to the legislature in the matter of re-organising landlord--tenant relations in the area of agricultural property. In State of Maharashtra v. Kamal Durgule, 90 the Supreme Courtinvalidated the Maharashtra Vacant Lands (Prohibition of Unauthorised Occupation and Summary Eviction) Act, 1975,qua Art. 19(1)(f),91 confirming the decision by the Bombay High Courtdelivered in 1980. The underlying purpose of the Act was to discourage unauthorised occupation of lands in urban areas in Maharashtra and to provide for the summary eviction of persons from such land. The Act in question conferred on the competent authority the discretion to declare a piece of land as vacant land without laying down any guidelines to control the exercise of that discretion. Neither the preamble to the Act nor the statement of objects and reasons attached to the relevant bill provided any guidelines for the exercise of the discretion by the concerned authority. The result was that the competent authority had the freedom to pick and choose lands on which there were unauthorised structures and declare some of them as vacant lands and leave other lands similarly situated untouched. The Supreme Court said: \"It is true that abuse of power is not to be assumed lightly but experience belies the expectation that discretionary powers are always exercised fairly and objectively.\"92 The Court also emphasized that the fact that the power to make the requisite declaration under the Act was vested in the officers of the higher echelons would make no difference to this position and that this was \"not a palliative to the prejudice which is inherent in the situation\".93 Page 80 Also, the impugned Act did not provide for any safeguards against any arbitrary exercise of discretion by the competent authority. No procedure was laid down for any notice to the concerned parties or hearing before the competent authority. The Court emphasized that in the matters covered by the Act, a hearing preceding a decision was of the essence of the matter. Further, the Act made no distinction between land-owners who had themselves constructed unauthorised structures on their land and those on whose lands trespassers had constructed such structures. Massive encroachments on private lands had led to the virtual deprivation of the title of rightful owners of those properties. The Act penalised such owners for no fault of theirs, and, that, too, without giving them an opportunity to be heard.",

The Act penalised such owners for no fault of theirs, and, that, too, without giving them an opportunity to be heard. Lack of classification was hit by Art. 14 as it suffered from the infirmity of according equal treatment to unequals. This class of owners were silent spectators to the forcible and lawless deprivation of their title to their lands but had been placed on par with the trespassers who taking the law into their hands defied not merely private owners but even public authority.94 C. ARTICLE 31 Article 31(1) laid down that no person could be deprived of his property without the authority of law. This provision has been repealed through the 44th Amendment but it re-appears as Art. 300A noted later in the next Chapter.95 Therefore, nothing need be said on Art. 31(1) at this place. Article 31(2) has also been repealed now but discussion thereon has been included here partly for its historical importance; partly to illustrate judicial activism and creativity in interpreting the Constitution; partly because of a kind of tussle between the Supreme Court and Parliament, as the constituent body, on the question of compensation for property acquired, and partly because some of the ideas developed under Art. 31(2) might come to be incorporated by the courts in the interpretation of Art. 300A. Article 31(2) as it stood before its abrogation in 1978 ran as follows: \"No property shall be compulsorily acquired or requisitioned save for a public purpose and save by authority of a law which provides for acquisition or requisitioning of the property for an amount which may be fixed by such law or which may be determined in accordance with such principles and given in such manner as may be specified in such law, and no such law shall be called in question in any court on the ground that the amount so fixed or determined is not adequate or that the whole or any part of such amount is to be given otherwise than in cash.\" This was an amended version of the original Art. 31(2) as it appeared in the Constitution in 1950. The above clause was substituted by the XXV Amendment of the Constitution in 1971.1 The process of amending Art. 31(2) from 1950 to 1978 is discussed below. The original Art. 31(2) ran as follows: \"No property... shall be taken possession of or acquired for public purposes under any law authorising the taking of such possession or such acquisition, unless the law provides for compensation for the property taken possession of or acquired and either fixes the amount of compensation, or specifies the principles on which, and the manner in which, the compensation is to be determined and given\". Four concepts were involved in Art. 31(2): (1) Property; (2) Compulsory acquisition and requisitioning by the State; (3) amount; and (4) public purpose. Each of these concepts is discussed below. (i) PROPERTY The term 'property' was used in this provision not in a narrow, but in a comprehensive, sense. \"Any legal right which can be enforced through a court is a right in the nature of property within the meaning of Art. 31(2).\" Even an actionable claim could be regarded as property.2 Page 81 (ii) COMPULSORY ACQUISITION OR REQUISITIONING These words did not occur in the Article originally. To begin with, in their place, the words in the Article were \"taken possession of or acquired\". The Supreme Court giving a liberal interpretation to these words held that they meant the same things as 'deprivation' in Art. 31(1). The result of this judicial approach was that abridgement of the incidents of property might amount to 'deprivation' for which compensation became payable even though the state might not have acquired the same. In State of West Bengal v. Subodh Gopal, 3 the Supreme Court stressed that Arts. 31(1) and 31(2) were not mutually exclusive in scope and content; that they should be read together and understood as dealing with the same subject-matter, viz., protection of private property, and that 'deprivation' contemplated in Art. 31(1) was nothing else but \"acquisition or taking possession\" of property referred to in Art. 31(2). Thus, curtailment of an incident of estate was held to fall within Arts. 31(1) and (2).4 In Dwarkadas v. Sholapur Spinning and Weaving Co .,5 the Central Government promulgated an ordinance vesting the assets and management of the Sholapur Mills in government-appointed directors. This step was taken to avert closure of the mills due to mismanagement. The Supreme Court declared the law bad because vesting of Company's property in government nominees, who functioned under government orders, meant that the company's property had in effect been taken possession of by the State, depriving the company of it, without compensation. The Court rejected the argument that \"taking possession of\" in Art. 31(2) meant that Art. 31(2) would not apply unless the property was vested in the State for State purpose. The Court ruled that compensation was payable no matter by what process a person was deprived of his property, or what use the State made of it. In Saghir Ahmad v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 6 the Court held that depriving a person of his interest in a commercial undertaking attracted Art. 31(2) although the State did not acquire or take possession of the same. Taking of possession of kans infested land temporarily by the state for purposes of reclaiming it was held to amount to taking possession of land within the meaning of Art.",

    "content": "Saghir Ahmad v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 6 the Court held that depriving a person of his interest in a commercial undertaking attracted Art. 31(2) although the State did not acquire or take possession of the same. Taking of possession of kans infested land temporarily by the state for purposes of reclaiming it was held to amount to taking possession of land within the meaning of Art. 31(2) for which compensation was payable.7 These cases established the proposition that the words 'acquisition' or 'taking possession' in Art. 31(2) were synonymous with 'deprivation' in Art. 31(1). Therefore, if the right to enjoy property was impaired, or if any incident of property was abridged or diluted, or if the value of the property was affected, by any law, compensation became payable irrespective of the fact whether the state was acquiring the property for public use or just seeking to regulate it. The crucial question, however, in any such situation was whether the 'deprivation' resulting from government regulation was 'substantial' or not. This was a question for the courts to decide and, thus, the courts had effective power to draw a balance between State 'regulation' and private property.8 Had Art. 31(2) stood as it was at this time, it might have been possible for the courts in India to create a body of rules, on the basis of what constituted \"substantial deprivation\", to lay down in what kinds of deprivation of property should compensation be payable. The position might have been somewhat akin to the position in the U.S.A., discussed earlier. But that was not to be as Art. 31(2) was drastically amended by the Fourth Constitutional Amendment which caused a change of great consequence as it took such matters out of the area of compensation and restricted its payment only to situations when the state took possession or acquired the ownership of property. It appeared to the Central Government that the judicial approach that compensation was payable even when a mere 'regulatory' law curtailed the right to property, too much restricted the capacity of the State to regulate economic affairs. To get over this difficulty, Art. 31(2) was amended in 1955 by the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act by which the words 'acquisition and taking possession of' were replaced by the expression \"compulsorily acquired or requisitioned\". To explain these terms, a new provision, Art. 31(2A), was added. Article 31(2A) said that unless a law provided for the transfer of ownership or right to possession of any property to the State, or to a State-owned or controlled corporation, \"it shall not be deemed to provide for the compulsory acquisition or requisitioning of property, notwithstanding that it deprives any person of his property.\" Page 82 Compensation was not payable for mere deprivation of property or extinction of ownership therein.9 Where no transfer of ownership or possession of property was effected, Art. 31(2) could not apply. Art. 31(2), therefore, held non-applicable when there was a mere extinction of a right arising under a contract.10 The purpose of these amendments was to restate more precisely the State's power of compulsory acquisition and requisitioning of property and to distinguish it from deprivation of property by the operation of regulatory or prohibitory laws. The Fourth Amendment made it clear that it is only in the first situation, and not for the second, that compensation was payable. To justify the necessity of the Fourth Amendment, so far as Art. 31(2) was concerned, an argument advanced by the Central Government was that the judiciary had held that compensation was payable for \"any deprivation of property', even by a purely regulatory law. The actual position, however, was somewhat different from that which this statement sought to make out. What the Supreme Court had actually held was that compensation was payable in case of \"substantial dispossession\" or \"serious impairment\" of the property right. The Central Government was not satisfied with this judicial approach and wanted to restrict payment of compensation only when there was acquisition involving transfer of ownership, or requisitioning involving transfer of the right of possession to the state, and not for mere deprivation of property right. The right to private property thus became very much circumscribed as a result of the Fourth Amendment. As a result of this new provision, the rulings in cases like Sholapur Mills or Saghir Ahmad could no longer be invoked. Thus, deprivation of property now became divided into two categories: (1) compulsory acquisition and requisitioning of property by the State for a public purpose; (2) deprivation of property without the ownership or right of possession being transferred to the state. The new Art. 31(2) applied to the former, but not to the latter, situation. Thus, compensation was payable by the state in case (1), and not in case (2), in which case only a valid law was needed. Consequently, a provision imposing certain restrictions on sale of lands by an occupant and declaring that a sale contravening these conditions would be invalid and the land forfeited to the government was held to amount to 'deprivation' under Art. 31(1) and not 'acquisition' under Art. 31(2).11 A law authorising State transport authority to cancel existing permits of a person carrying on his transport business, and issuing the same to the State transport undertaking was held not to involve the transfer of undertaking of the quondam permit holder to the new entrant.12 This overruled Saghir Ahmad on this point. Land of some persons had been sold by public auction for non-payment of revenue during the struggle for independence. A State law re-transferred this land from the present holder to the original owners. It was held that transfer of land from one person to another, without the State itself getting any interest therein, was 'deprivation' under Art. 31(1) and not 'compulsory acquisition or requisition' under Art.",

    "content": "State law re-transferred this land from the present holder to the original owners. It was held that transfer of land from one person to another, without the State itself getting any interest therein, was 'deprivation' under Art. 31(1) and not 'compulsory acquisition or requisition' under Art. 31(2).13 (iii) AMOUNT After the inauguration of the Constitution, for a number of years, the question of quantum of compensation payable by the government for private property acquired by it became a very controversial matter. Before the year 1971, the word 'compensation' occurred in Art. 31(2). Since the inauguration of the Constitution, the Courts had been faced with two critical questions: (1) What was the significance of the word 'compensation'? (2) What should be the role of the courts in this respect? The developments in this area could be discussed in three stages as follows. (a) BEFORE 1955 As Art. 31(2) originally stood in the Constitution, the word 'compensation' used therein was not qualified by any adjective like 'just' or 'adequate', unlike the U.S. Constitution where the V Amendment requires the payment of 'just compensation' when the Federal Government takes private property for public use. Page 83 Nevertheless, the Supreme Court displaying a creative stance, took the position that the omission of the word 'just' or 'adequate' before 'compensation' was immaterial, and that the word 'compensation' standing alone, by itself, meant 'just' and 'equivalent' compensation for the interest in property acquired. This approach was adopted in a number of cases by the Supreme Court. The foremost case advocating this judicial point of view was State of West Bengal v. Bella Banerji.14 The West Bengal Legislature enacted a law to acquire land for settling refugees from East Pakistan. It provided that the 'compensation' to the owners of the land acquired was not to exceed the market value of the property as on December 31, 1946. The law was held to be unconstitutional on the ground that the 'compensation' bore no relation to the market value of the land on the date of acquisition. Land could be acquired many years after the prescribed date, but compensation for it was still to be assessed with reference to the prescribed date and not the date of acquisition, which was objectionable. The Court emphasized that 'compensation' meant 'just equivalent' of the property acquired and that it was a justiciable matter which the courts could adjudicate upon.15 The same principle was applied by the Supreme Court in State of Madras v. D. Namasivaya Mudaliar .16 A Madras law providing for payment of compensation for acquisition of lignite-bearing land on the basis of the land value on April 28, 1947, irrespective of the date of acquisition was held invalid. The Court held that freezing land value with reference to a specified date denied the landowners increment in land value since the specified date till the date of acquisition and this did not amount to 'compensation' as envisaged in Art. 31(2).17 Thus, before 1955, the Supreme Court had taken the position that a statute was liable to be struck down as infringing Art. 31(2) on the ground that 'compensation' provided by it was inadequate and that 'compensation' ought to be the just equivalent of the property of which a person was deprived and that 'adequacy' of 'compensation' was a justiciable matter. An interesting point to note in this connection is that while in 1950, in Gopalan,18 the Supreme Court had adopted a strictly literal interpretation of Art. 21 in a matter dealing with personal liberty, the Court adopted a liberal and purposive interpretation of Art. 31(2) dealing with the question of property. This dichotomy of judicial attitudes towards the two constitutional provisions indicates that, at this time, the Court attached far more importance to property rights than to right of person and, therefore, it was prepared to give greater protection to property than to person. (b) FROM 1955 TO 1971 The Central Government became uneasy at the judicial insistence on payment of full market value for the property acquired, as it thought that it would place an onerous burden on the country's slender resources and would throw out of gear the envisaged socioeconomic programme involving reconstruction of property relations, especially, in the area of agricultural land. Therefore, to get over this hurdle, the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1955, was undertaken.19 The Fourth Amendment amended Art. 31(2) with a view to make the question of 'adequacy' of compensation as 'non-justiciable'. The courts were now debarred from going into the question whether the quantum of compensation provided by a law for property being acquired or requisitioned by the state was 'adequate' or not. Art. 31(2) at this time ran as follows: \"(2) No property shall be compulsorily acquired or requisitioned save for a public purpose and save by authority of a law which provides for compensation for the property so acquired or requisitioned and either fixes the amount of the compensation or specifies the principles on which, and the manner in which, the compensation is to be determined and given; and no such law shall be questioned in any court on the ground that the compensation provided by that law is not adequate. (2A) Where a law does not provide for the transfer of the ownership or right to possession of any property to the State or to a corporation owned or controlled by the State, it shall not be deemed to provide for the compulsory acquisition or requisitioning of property, notwithstanding that it deprives any person of his property\". The Supreme Court has explained the purport of the Fourth Amendment as follows:20 \"After the 4th Amendment, the word \"compensation\", could not mean a full and fair money equivalent, for if it did, the law would have remained unchanged and the 4th Amendment would have failed of its purpose.",

    "content": "excluding a Page 84 challenge on the ground that the compensation provided by the law was not adequate, the 4th Amendment removed the restriction on legislative power in the sense that for the law to be valid it was no longer obligatory to provide for the payment of full and fair money equivalent.\" According to the sponsors of the Fourth Amendment, its purpose was to bring the Constitution in accord with the intentions of the framers of the Constitution, that the quantum of compensation ought to be decided finally by the Legislature. Pandit Nehru said in the Lok Sabha:21 \"It was obvious that those who framed the Constitution failed to give expression to their wishes accurately and precisely and thereby the Supreme Court and some other Courts have interpreted it in a different way.\" It was thus claimed that the Amendment was designed to word the Constitution precisely in accordance with what the framers of the Constitution at that time had envisaged, meant and openly said. It is true that Nehru and a few others in the Constituent Assembly had thought that the original article 31(2) made the Legislature the final arbiter of the quantum of compensation which ought not to be challengeable in the court except when there was fraud on the Constitution or a fraudulent exercise of the power so given. To the extent the Fourth Amendment made compensation non-justiciable, it could be said to accord with the intentions of some of the constitution-makers. But the Fourth Amendment did not stop at this. It had a much broader coverage. Arts. 31A and 31B22 were also added. These provisions were much more extensive in scope than what the framers of the Constitution had ever thought of. The Constitution was amended to serve certain purposes which the constitution-makers had never dreamt of. As for example, social welfare legislation and regulatory legislation were only recently thought of. The Amendment in effect reconstituted original Art. 31 in a very fundamental manner. The IVth Amendment however failed to exclude the courts completely from the area of 'compensation'. In 1961, in Burrakur Coal Co. v. Union of India, 23 a law acquiring coal-bearing land provided compensation only for the land but not for the minerals therein. The Supreme Court refused to hold the law bad arguing that the question of non-payment of compensation for minerals referred to adequacy of compensation in which the court could not go. This pronouncement may be regarded as being in tune with what the Fourth Amendment was designed to envisage. But, thereafter, from 1965 onwards the judicial view underwent a change. The Supreme Court again started showing some activism on the question of compensation. In its bid to break through the shackles imposed by Art. 31(2) after the IV Amendment, and provide some protection to private property, the Supreme Court took the view in Vajravelu v. Special Deputy Collector, 24 that the amended Art. 31(2) still retained the word 'compensation' which meant that the meaning of the expression 'compensation' as given to it in Bella Banerjee had been accepted. Therefore, a law for acquisition or requisitioning should still provide for a 'just compensation' for what the owner was being deprived of. Although, under the amended Art. 31(2), the principles prescribing the 'just equivalent' could not be questioned on the ground of inadequacy yet, if the principles were not relevant to the value of the property acquired at the time of acquisition, then the courts could intervene and scrutinise the validity of the principles. The Supreme Court was careful to emphasize that this formulation had reference not to the 'adequacy' of 'compensation' but to 'no compensation' at all. Thus, \"if the compensation is illusory, or if the principles prescribed are irrelevant to the value of the property at or about the time of its acquisition\" then it could be said that the legislature had played a fraud on the Constitution. The compensation given might not be adequate, yet it should not be so little as to constitute a fraud on the legislative power. If, however, the principles to determine compensation were relevant to the fixing of \"compensation\", and were not arbitrary, then the 'adequacy' of the resultant product could not be questioned in a court. The Supreme Court thus asserted a power of judicial review of compensation in certain situations. In effect, however, under the new norm, compensation could be less than the market value of the property acquired. The new formula was somewhat different from, rather less rigorous than, the Bella Banerjee view, but still the courts claimed a foothold in the area of compensation and did not completely vacate the field. This ruling was an attempt on the part of the Supreme Court to break through the restrictive Art. 31(2). The government could not escape by providing shadowy compensation merely to fulfil the letter of the law. This shows that Page 85 the Court was anxious to extend some protection to property rights. In pursuance of this judicial approach, in 1967, the Supreme Courtdeclared invalid the Metal Corporation of India (Acquisition of Undertaking) Act, 1965. The Act aquiring the corporation laid down two principles for valuation of its assets: (1) the unused equipment in good condition was to be valued at the actual cost of its acquisition to the company; (2) the used equipment was to be valued at the written down value determined in accordance with the principles contained in the Income-tax Act. The Court held these principles not 'relevant' to the fixing of compensation for the machinery at the time of its acquisition.",

    "content": "Supreme Court, however, insisted that if the principles were relevant to the fixing of 'compensation', and were not 'arbitrary', then the 'adequacy' of the resultant product could not be questioned in a court.25 The judicial view appeared to have undergone some change in State of Gujarat v. Shantilal .26 Under a Town Planning Act, a notification expressing intention of the government to acquire a plot of land was issued in 1942; the actual acquisition took place in 1957, and compensation was assessed with reference to its market value in 1942. This was challenged on the ground that the value of the land determined with reference to a date far removed from the date of actual acquisition could not be regarded as the 'just equivalent' of the property acquired. The Supreme Courtupheld the Act because the principle for determining 'compensation' laid down therein could not be said to be 'irrelevant' to the determination of 'compensation', nor could the 'compensation' be regarded as 'illusory'. The Court emphasized that it could not go into the question of 'adequacy' of compensation unless the legislature abused its legislative power and called something as 'compensation' which was not a recompense at all or was 'illusory'. Principles to determine compensation could be challenged on the ground that \"they are irrelevant to the determination of compensation,\" but not on the plea that the compensation being awarded was not \"just or fair compensation\". The Metal Corporation case was overruled with the remark that there \"the principles were not irrelevant to the determination of compensation and the compensation was not illusory.\" The dichotomy of the judicial views expressed in Metal Corporation and Shantilal was this: in the former case, the Court laid emphasis on 'just equivalent' of the property acquired, and, therefore, if the law in question specified principles for fixing 'compensation' for the property acquired to achieve that object then the 'adequacy' of the 'compensation' was not challengeable in a court. In Shantilal, the Court repudiated the idea of 'just equivalent'; it now laid emphasis merely on 'compensation' and would intervene only if it was 'illusory', or if the principles specified for the purpose were 'irrelevant'. To appreciate Shantilal ruling, it is necessary to remember that it is a well recognised principle of land acquisition that compensation is payable with reference to its value on the date of notification acquiring the land and not on the date the state takes actual possession thereof. The Court could not jettison this entrenched principle. So, it had to uphold the law in Shantilal even if it involved dilution of the Metal Corp. principle. The Shantilal case thus restored much greater freedom to the legislature to order compensation in the way it wanted for any property acquired. The scope of judicial review was restricted to the extreme situation of abuse of legislative power.27 Then came the celebrated Bank Nationalization case.28 It arose out of the nationalization of 11 commercial banks in 1969. The principles laid down in the relevant law for payment of compensation to the banks for their undertakings acquired was challenged on the ground that it did not seek to provide just compensation. This line of attack followed substantially the judicial approach adopted in Vajravelu and Metal Corporation. The government argued on the basis of Shantilal that it was not predicated for the validity of a law that it must aim at awarding just equivalent for the property acquired, and if the law was not confiscatory, or the principles to determine compensation not irrelevant, then the Court could not go into the propriety of such principles, or the adequacy or reasonableness of compensation. The Supreme Court declared the relevant law to be unconstitutional by a majority of 10 to 1. The Court ruled that if the principles specified by the law were relevant to the determination of compensation, then they would be beyond challenge. The Court explained that the principles adopted should be such as were appropriate to, and recognised for, determining the value of the class of property sought to be acquired. A method appropriate to determining the value of one class of property might be wholly inappropriate to determining the value of another class of property. There might be several appropriate principles to determine the value Page 86 of the class of property acquired. If one appropriate principle was applied to determine compensation, the fact that by applying another appropriate principle, a different value was reached was irrelevant. The Court would not entertain the plea that out of the two appropriate methods, the legislature should have adopted the one more generous to the owner. However, in the instant case, the statute in question was held unconstitutional on the ground that it failed \"to provide to the expropriated banks compensation determined according to relevant principles\". The method specified to value lands and buildings were not relevant to the determination of compensation. The Court objected to the taking into account of the value of only some of the components of the undertaking. It emphasized that the entire undertaking should be taken as a unit for purposes of assessing compensation. \"Aggregate of the value of components is not necessarily the value of the entirety of a unit of property acquired, especially when the property is a going concern, with an organised business.\" In the instant case, no compensation had been paid for certain items of property. e.g., for goodwill of the banks; unexpired leases of properties held by the banks, etc. A single debt owed by a bank had been debited twice, once while computing the value of the assets, and again in computing the liabilities. The method specified to value lands and buildings were not relevant to the determination of compensation for them, etc. Thus, the expropriated banks had not been given \"a true recompense\" for the loss of their undertakings.",

    "content": "method specified to value lands and buildings were not relevant to the determination of compensation for them, etc. Thus, the expropriated banks had not been given \"a true recompense\" for the loss of their undertakings. Although the Supreme Court asserted that the new formulation regarding compensation payable for property acquired was the point of convergence of the two trends of judicial thought as represented by Vajravelu and Shantilal, in reality, the new approach was much closer to Vajravelu. The Court now claimed wider power to intervene in matters of compensation than it had asserted in Shantilal. The Court could now intervene not only when compensation was illusory, or the principles to determine the same were irrelevant, but also when relevant principles appropriate to the property in question were not applied to determine compensation. In the instant case, the difficulty created in the Court's ruling was got over by amending the invalidated law so as to withdraw the principles laid down therein to determine compensation and, instead, mentioning a specified amount for each bank nationalised as compensation. This strategy could not possibly be challenged because it would be extremely difficult to substantiate the argument that the specific sum specified as compensation was illusory, or was based on irrelevant considerations, or was not based on relevant principles.29 The BankNationalization case was criticised on the ground that it ran counter to what the Fourth Amendment was designed to achieve. This was, in effect, taking too mechanistic a view of the Constitution. So long as a Fundamental Right exists in the Constitution, it is the duty of the courts to apply it in a meaningful way. The Supreme Court could, however, be criticised on the ground that it had often changed its views on the question of compensation. There was also some substance in the criticism that judicial quantification of compensation would create some difficulties in the way of enactment of socio-economic legislation. But, because of Arts. 31A and 31B, such criticism had limited validity. Only a few types of laws not falling within the purview of Arts. 31A and 31B could even be questioned under Art. 31(2). Most of the socioeconomic legislation was thus protected from any challenge. The Supreme Court's stand that principles of compensation should be 'relevant' to the type of property acquired left a lot of flexibility to the legislature in the matter of compensation as it could select any of the several relevant formulae. One and the same formula was never predicated for all types of acquisitions. Thus, acquisition of a dilapidated building could be treated differently in the matter of compensation from the acquisition of a going, profitable, wealth-producing industrial undertaking. In P.A. Shah v. State of Gujarat, 30 the question was raised whether the Bank Nationalization case overruled Shantilal. In Kesavananda,31 opinions were expressed by several Judges to the effect that the Bank Nationalization case was inconsistent with, and had 'virtually overruled' Shantilal. In Shah, however, the Supreme Court opined that Shantilal remained intact after, and was not overruled by, the Bank Nationalization case, but was merely explained therein. Page 87 (c) AFTER 1971 The judicial view enunciated in the Bank Nationalisation case was not palatable to the Central Government which thought that it ran counter to what the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution was designed to achieve and would create difficulties in the way of the government's socio-economic programme. Accordingly, Parliament enacted the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution in 1971. This Amendment effected several significant changes in the relevant constitutional principles and, thus, further diluting property rights.32 The major change effected in Art. 31(2) by the XXV Amendment was to substitute the word 'amount' for the word 'compensation'.33 The reason for making this change was that the word 'compensation' had developed certain connotations because of its interpretation by the courts as being 'just equivalent' of the property acquired. The word 'amount' had no such connotation. The underlying purpose of the Amendment, therefore, was to exclude judicial review of the quantum of money offered by the government in lieu of the property acquired by it. The XXIV Amendment also clarified that the 'amount' may be given wholly or partly otherwise than in cash. This only reiterated what the courts had already held earlier in relation to payment of compensation. Payment of compensation in bonds had been upheld.34 It had also been held that cash payment of compensation was not always necessary and that the satisfaction of the expropriated owner could be made by the State allotting him some other property in exchange.35 Further, advance payment of 'amount' was not envisaged by Art. 31(2) and, therefore, the time-factor within which the 'amount' was to be paid was within the discretion of the Legislature. The task of fixing the amount, or laying down the principles on which it was to be paid, must be discharged by the legislature itself and this matter could not be left to the discretion of the executive. Thus, a legal provision leaving it entirely to the government to requisition property at any rate fixed by it in its discretion violated Art. 31(2) as it failed to specify the principles on which the amount was to be paid for the property acquired.36 When the legislature laid down the principles for assessment of amount, provided that it could be paid partly in cash and partly in bonds, and also fixed the number of instalments in which the amount had to be paid, the legislature had applied its mind to prescribing the manner and form in which the amount was payable and it could then validly leave it to the government to fix the ratio between cash and bonds and also the time-lag between the instalments. These matters depend on the financial resources of the concerned State and availability of funds and only the government could have adequate knowledge about these matters.37 The effect of the change made in Art.",

State of Kerala, 38 The broad effect of the multiple judicial opinions delivered therein was broadly as follows: 'Amount' was not the same concept as 'compensation', and the courts would not go into the question of its adequacy or inadequacy. Nevertheless, 'amount' could be 'illusory' or 'arbitrary' or 'grossly low' which would shock not only the judicial conscience but the conscience of every reasonable human being. Though the 'amount' need not be the market value of the property acquired or requisitioned, yet it should have some reasonable relationship with the value of such property. The majority agreed that the word 'amount' indicated that the law must provide for payment of some amount in lieu of the expropriation. The court could still invalidate the law as unconstitutional if it provided no amount, or some amount which was illusory. As Chandrachud, J., observed in Kesavananda:39 \"The specific obligation to pay an 'amount' and in the alternative the use of the word 'principles' for determination of that amount must mean that the amount fixed or determined to be paid cannot be illusory\". Shelat and Grover, JJ., emphasized in Kesavananda that \"the right to receive the amount continues to be a Fundamental Right\" under Art. 31(2) and, in a democracy, the legislature cannot use its power in an arbitrary manner. Therefore, the court will have to be satisfied that the 'amount' has reasonable relationship with the value of the property acquired or requisitioned and one or more of the relevant principles have been applied and further that the 'amount' is neither illusory nor it has been fixed arbitrarily, not at such a figure that it Page 88 means virtual depreciation of the right under Article 31(2). The question of adequacy or inadequacy, however, cannot be gone into.\"40 On this view of the matter, a restricted judicial review of the 'amount' payable for property acquired was still a possibility. The ambit of judicial review was limited to the illusory nature of the amount fixed and the arbitrariness of the principles laid down for determination of the amount. In State of Karnataka v. Ranganath Reddy, 41 the Supreme Court observed by majority: \"....still the overwhelming view of the majority of the Judges in Kesvananda Bharati's case is that the amount payable for the acquired property either fixed by the legislature or determined on the basis of the principles engrafted in the law of acquisition cannot be wholly arbitrary and illusory....\" An example of the application of this principle is to be found in Chaman Mal v. State of Haryana .42 The petitioners purchased saltpetre-bearing land from the State Government for over one lakh of rupees. He also incurred other additional expenditure on this land for the extraction of saltpetre. Under a law acquiring minerals, this land was acquired by the State, and in lieu thereof the petitioner was to get only Rs. 5,000, payable over the next ten years, at the rate of Rs. 500 per year. The High Court struck down the law holding that the amount had no relation with the value of the minerals to be found in land, and that it was 'illusory and arbitrary' and was 'shocking to the judicial conscience' and the 'conscience of every reasonable human being'. In a number of cases, the Supreme Court affirmed the proposition that the compensation fixed by law was justiciable not on the ground of its inadequacy but on the ground of being illusory.43 The Maharashtra Housing and Development Act, 1977, provided for acquisition of land for the Maharashtra Housing and Development Board. Procedure to acquire land was laid down in the Act. Different scales of compensation were laid down for urban and rural lands. For urban land, compensation was 100 times the net average monthly income actually derived from such land during the last five years. But for rural land, the compensation was as laid down in the Land Acquisition Act which was higher than payable for urban land. TheSupreme Court ruled in State of Maharashtra v. Basantibai, 44 that the amount payable, i.e., 100 times the net monthly income was neither illusory nor too low having regard to the rate of interest on safe investments. In Achutananda Purohit v. State of Orissa, 45 it was held that fixation of compensation on slab system providing smaller multiples for estates yielding larger income would not violate Arts. 14 and 31(2). In Tinsukhiya,46 payment of amount based on the basis of the written down value of the assets calculated according to the Income-tax law was held not violative of Art. 14 and it was held to be not illusory nor arbitrary. In Bhim Singhji v. Union of India, 47 the Supreme Court adopted an extreme view. Fixation of an amount of Rs. 2 lacs as the maximum amount under s. 11(6)of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976, for a property worth Rs. 2 crores (thus payment of 1% of the value of the property) was held to be not illusory, not confiscatory and, thus, not violative of Arts. 14 and 31(2). Krishna Iyer, J., observed:48 \"Full compensation or even fair compensation cannot be claimed as a fundamental right by the private owner and that short of paying a 'farthing for a fortune' the question of compensation is out of bounds for the court to investigate\". He went on the say that a sum of Rs. 2 lakhs is not a \"farthing for a fortune\" whatever the total market value of the property may be. It cannot be regarded as a fictitious or flimsy payment. One fails to understand what does the word 'illusory' really mean if payment of Re. 1/- for the property worth Rs.",

One fails to understand what does the word 'illusory' really mean if payment of Re. 1/- for the property worth Rs. 100/- is held to be not 'illusory'. Though the language of Art. 31(2) prima facie comprehended movable property including choses in action and money, these were held to fall outside the power of acquisition. Taking away money and then giving an Page 89 'amount' in lieu thereof could be nothing more than a forced loan. Thus, choses in action and money could not be acquired and, accordingly, the State could not abolish cash grants payable by it.49 In State of Bihar v. Kameshwar, 50 it was held that arrears of rent due to a landlord by his tenants up to a date prior to acquisition of his land could not be acquired by the State. (iv) PUBLIC PURPOSE Under Art. 31(2), the State could acquire or requisition property for a public purpose only. Therefore, a legislature had no power to acquire property for a private purpose. Under entry 42, List III, a legislature could acquire property even without a public purpose, but Art. 31(2) would be an obstacle for such a law. That obstacle would disappear if the law fell within the compass of Art. 31A.51 The concept of 'public purpose' connotes public welfare. With the onward march of the concept of socioeconomic welfare of the people, notions as to the scope of general interest of the community are fast changing and expanding. The emphasis is unmistakably shifting from the individual to the community. The concept of 'public interest' is thus elastic and not static, and varies with time and needs of the society. Whatever furthers the general interest of the community, as opposed to particular interest of the individuals, may be regarded as 'public purpose'. 'Public purpose' does not always mean benefit of the public at large; benefit of only certain individuals, or even of one individual may be 'public purpose' if public derives an advantage out of it, or if it furthers some scheme of public utility. A few examples of what were held judicially as 'public purpose' for which land could validly be acquired under Art. 31(2) are: (i) finding accommodation for an individual having no housing accommodation;52 (ii) housing a staff member of a foreign consulate;53 (iii) accommodating an employee of a road transport corporation--a statutory body;54 (iv) accommodating a government servant;55 (v) nationalization of land;56 (vi) agrarian reform abolishing intermediaries between government and tillers of the soil;57 (vii) establishing an institution of technical education;58 (viii) constructing houses for industrial labour by a company;59 (ix) promoting co-operative housing societies in Delhi to relieve housing shortage;60 (x) planned development of Delhi;61 (xi) development of housing, shopping and industrial sites.62etc. Since the existence of 'public purpose' was an essential condition for acquiring or requisitioning property under Art. 31(2), a law enacted for the purpose, but having no 'public purpose' to support it, was unconstitutional. Whether a public purpose existed or not was a justiciable matter. As stated by the Supreme Court in State of Bombay v. Nanji, 63 \"Prima facie the Government is the best judge as to whether 'public purpose' is served by issuing a requisition order, but it is not the sole judge. The courts have the jurisdiction and it is their duty to determine the matter whenever a question is raised whether a requisition order is or is not for a 'public purpose'.\" The Courts, however, adopted a very liberal attitude on the question of public purpose, and it was rare indeed for a court to hold that an acquisition of land was not for public purpose. The courts showed a good deal of deference on this matter to the legislative and executive determination and judgment, but, nevertheless, the ultimate power vested in the courts.64 Accordingly, a provision excluding the jurisdiction of the courts from this area, and making decisions of either the executive or the legislature as to public purpose final and conclusive was held ultra vires Art. 31(2).65 S. 6(3)of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, provides that the declaration by the State Government of the existence of public purpose for land acquisition \"shall be conclusive evidence that the land is needed for public purpose\". This provision would have beenultra vires Art. 31(2) had it not been protected under Art. 31(5)(a).66This provision completely barred judicial review of public purpose of an acquisition under the Act except when it is 'colourable'. Neither the meaning nor the existence of public purpose under this Act was Page 90 justiciable. The finding of the government under S. 6(3) was conclusive not only with regard to public purpose but also regarding its need and government's satisfaction thereon. Where, however, acquisition would not serve any purpose, or where it was for a 'private purpose', it could be challenged as being 'colourable.'67 D. LAW ENACTED BY A STATE In addition to the above-mentioned conditions imposed by Art. 31(2), a law made by a State Legislature, and falling within the purview of Art. 31(2), was to fulfil yet another condition, viz., it was not to be effective until it had been reserved for the President's consideration and had received his assent.68 This was the effect of Art. 31(3). A State law falling within the purview of Art. 31(2), but not reserved for President's assent under Art. 31(3), had no legal effect. The purpose underlying Art. 31(3) was to bring under Central control the State Legislation acquiring or requisitioning property so as to ensure that no unjust expropriatary legislation was enacted by a State. The Central Government could ensure that the States follow some uniform norms for payment of compensation for similar property.",

    "content": "A State law falling within the purview of Art. 31(2), but not reserved for President's assent under Art. 31(3), had no legal effect. The purpose underlying Art. 31(3) was to bring under Central control the State Legislation acquiring or requisitioning property so as to ensure that no unjust expropriatary legislation was enacted by a State. The Central Government could ensure that the States follow some uniform norms for payment of compensation for similar property. Such a precaution was necessary because the question of adequacy of 'amount' payable for land acquired lay outside the judicial purview.69 E. INTER-RELATION OF ART. 31, ART. 14 AND ART. 19(1)(F) Article 31(2) did not remove the bar of Art. 14. A law could be challenged on the basis of discrimination in the matter of payment of compensation. Art. 31(2) precluded challenge to the adequacy of amount but not a challenge on the basis of discrimination, if any, made between owners of land under like circumstances and conditions. For example, a person whose land was acquired for construction of a hospital or a school could not be paid less amount than one whose land was acquired for any other lucrative project. Classification could not be made for the purpose of payment of compensation on the basis of the public purpose for which the land was acquired. As regards the owner, he lost his land and it was immaterial for him whether his land was acquired for one or the other public purpose. Art. 14 confers an individual right and a classification can be justified only if there is something to justify a different treatment to this individual right. Similarly no classification could be made for the purpose of payment of the amount on the basis of the land-acquiring authority. Whether the land acquired by the State is for an improvement trust, or a municipality, the same principles to assess the amount for the land acquired should apply. For the landowner, it hardly matters as to who acquires the land. Similarly, it is equally immaterial whether the land is acquired under the one or the other statute. Art. 14 comes into play if there are two acquisition statutes enabling the state to give one owner different treatment from another equally situated owner.70 The question concerning the inter-relationship between Arts. 19(1)(f) and 31 created difficulties and there were several changes in the judicial view in this area. Initially, the judicial view was that Art. 19(1)(f) would not apply to a law 'depriving', as distinguished from, 'restricting' a citizen of his property and that the validity of a law depriving a person of his property could be adjudged only under Art. 31 and not under Art. 19(1)(f). The rationale of the view was that Art. 19(1)(f) \"postulates the existence of property which can be enjoyed and over which rights can be exercised\" because otherwise the reasonable restrictions contemplated by Art. 19(5) could not be brought into play; Art. 19(1)(f) dealt with substantial and substantive rights and not with illusory phantoms of title; when every form of enjoyment which normally accompanied an interest in property was taken away leaving only the husk of title, Art. 19(1)(f) was not attracted.71 If an acquisition law was valid under Art. 31(2), the acquisition of property would be justified under the law, and once the property was acquired there was no property left in respect of which Art. 19(1)(f) could apply. Page 91 This view underwent a change in Kochunni.72 The factual situation was that the petitioner was the holder of the Kavalappara Sthanam73 having extensive properties attached to it. These properties constituted an impartible estate in which the members of the family had no interest. The Madras Legislature enacted a law declaring that sthanam property having certain characteristics would be deemed to be tarwad property.74The validity of the Act was challenged under Art. 19(1)(f). The Supreme Court held that the Act by treating sthanam property, by a fiction of law, as tarwad property, deprived the sthanees of their properties without compensation. The law was thus expropriatary in character and on its face stamped with unreasonableness. Also, no public interest was served by the law. Thus, it was held bad under Art. 19(1)(f) and was not saved by Art. 19(5). The Supreme Court explained the reasons to apply Art. 19(1)(f) to 'deprivation' of property falling under Art. 31(1) as follows: The amendment of Art. 31(2) by the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution in 1955 had changed the position. Before the amendment, Arts. 31(1) and (2) were regarded as not mutually exclusive in scope and content, but as dealing with the same subject-matter viz., acquisition or taking possession of property referred to in Art. 31(2). On this view, Art. 31 was a self-contained provision providing for a subject different from that dealt with in Art. 19 and, therefore, to harmonise Arts. 19 and 31, and to avoid overlapping between the two provisions, Art. 19(1)(f) was not applied to 'deprivation' of property. But such an analogy could not be drawn after the Fourth Amendment, because Arts. 31(1) and 31(2) then came to deal with two different concepts: Art. 31(1) with 'deprivation' of property by authority of law, and Art. 31(2) read with Art. 31(2)(A) with 'acquisition and requisition'. The law depriving a person of his property, as envisaged by Art. 31(1), should be a 'valid' law which meant that it should not infringe any other Fundamental Right including Art. 19(1)(f). The ruling in Kochunni denoted a correct approach and became the accepted norm. The Kochunni view was a consequence of watering down the efficacy of Art. 31 by the Fourth Amendment. Arts. 19(1)(f) and 31(1) both dealt with property and, therefore, in the very nature of things, they should have been treated as 'supplementary' and 'co-ordinate' to, and not 'isolated' from, each other. A curious result of the Bhanji Munji ruling was that while the freedom of the legislature to affect enjoyment and possession of property was regulated by Art.",

    "content": "Kochunni view was a consequence of watering down the efficacy of Art. 31 by the Fourth Amendment. Arts. 19(1)(f) and 31(1) both dealt with property and, therefore, in the very nature of things, they should have been treated as 'supplementary' and 'co-ordinate' to, and not 'isolated' from, each other. A curious result of the Bhanji Munji ruling was that while the freedom of the legislature to affect enjoyment and possession of property was regulated by Art. 19(1)(f), and that to acquire and requisition property was controlled by Art. 31(2), it could freely deprive a person of his property under Art. 31(1). The Kochunni ruling meant that the legislative power to deprive a person of his property came to be controlled by Art. 19(1)(f), and the reasonableness of the law could be adjudged under Art. 19(5). 'Deprivation' does affect the right to hold, acquire and possess property. The biggest advantage of Art. 19(1)(f) was that procedural norms of a law depriving a person of his property could be adjudged for their reasonableness, and the law could be declared void if it lacked proper procedural safeguards against the exercise of administrative power.75 Kochunni represented a judicial attempt to interpret Fundamental Rights somewhat liberally, and restraints on these rights narrowly. Art. 31(1) gave practically an unlimited right to a legislature to deprive a person of his property, and so the courts sought to invoke Art. 19(1)(f) to impose some limitations on that power. In Gopalan,76 the Supreme Court had refused to apply Art. 19 to the area of preventive detention falling under Arts. 21 and 22. Bhanji Munji followed this approach and excluded the operation of Art. 19(1)(f) from the area of Art. 31(1). This approach denoted a literalistic, and not a liberal, approach to the process of constitutional interpretation.77 With the liberal approach adopted in Kochunni, the Court also came to adopt a similar approach to the relationship of Art. 19 with Arts. 21 and 22, a matter which has already been discussed earlier.78 Kochunni did not extend Art. 19(1)(f) to the area of acquisition and requisition covered by Art. 31(2). Bhanji Munji was a case on acquisition of property; Kochunni dealt with deprivation and not with acquisition. Therefore, Kochunni did not ipso facto overrule Bhanji Munji. This position was reiterated in several judicial Page 92 pronouncements.79 In 1967, the author had commented on this situation as follows: \"The flaw in this formulation is that an acquisition law has only to fulfil the requirements of Art. 31(2), and there are no norms of administrative procedure which such a law might have to fulfil. It is no gainsaying the fact that even a law of acquisition fulfilling the two requirements of compensation and public purpose should have some procedural norms, like a right of hearing to the party whose property is sought to be acquired. The courts may imply such procedural norms from the concept of 'natural justice', but the courts cannot insist that such a law not fulfilling the minimum procedural norms would be unconstitutional, and the concept of 'natural justice' can be excluded by legislation. The position is, therefore, unsatisfactory as regards acquisition laws.\"80 The Supreme Court sought to do away with this anomaly in the celebrated Bank Nationalisation case.81Overruling its previous pronouncements, the Court held that Art. 19(1)(f) would apply to acquisition of property falling under Art. 31(2) and, therefore, an \"enquiry into the reasonableness of the procedural provisions\" of an acquisition law was not excluded. Thus, \"if a tribunal is authorised by the Act to determine compensation of property compulsorily acquired without hearing the owner, the Act would be liable to be struck down under Art. 19(1)(f).\" Thus, an acquisition law had to pass the test of procedural reasonableness. The challenge to an acquisition law under Art. 19(1)(f) was limited to the question of procedural unreasonableness.82 This, no doubt, was a very justifiable view to take. It was the culmination of the trend initiated by the Court in Kochunni. But, this view could not last very long. By the Twenty-fifth Constitutional Amendment, a new clause, Art. 31(2)(A), was added to say that nothing in Art. 19(1)(f) \"shall affect any law as is referred to in Art. 31(2)\". The idea was to ensure that a law enacted to acquire any property by the government would not be tested with reference to Art. 19(1)(f). A law of acquisition was only to be adjudged under Art. 31(2). But Art. 19(1)(f) could still be invoked in case of deprivation. F. SAVING OF CERTAIN LAWS (1) Art. 31(5)(a) protected from Art. 31(2) an 'existing law' whether Central or State. An 'existing law', as defined in Art. 366(10), was a law enacted before the commencement of the Constitution, i.e., January 26, 1950. The Land Acquisition Act, 1894, being an 'existing law', was saved by Art. 31(5)(a).83 Article 31(5) (a) had reference only to Art. 31(2). It did not protect a law if it infringed Art. 14,84 or which was beyond the competence of the legislature at the time of its enactment.85 (2) According to Art. 31(5)(b)(i), Art. 31(2) was not to affect any law made to impose or levy any tax or penalty. Thus, the Constitution treated taxation as distinct from eminent domain. Taxation was governed by Art. 265 and not by Art. 31(2).86 (3) According to Art. 31(5)(b)(ii), Art. 31(2) did not affect a law made for the promotion of public health, or prevention of danger to life or property. This Article embodied, to some extent, the American concept of 'police power'.",

    "content": "doctrine of 'police power' was evolved in the U.S.A. to contain, to some extent, the ambit of the 'due process' and the 'commerce' clauses.87 The 'due process' clause appeared to be putting grave limitations on the States' regulatory powers regarding private rights of person and property and, therefore, the concept of 'police power' was evolved by the courts to curtail individual's rights somewhat and enable the government to prescribe regulations to promote health, peace, morals and good order of the people.88 The concept of police power constitutes an implied limitation on the Fundamental Rights of the people claimed under the due process clause. The doctrine of police powers has also enabled the States to impose some regulations on inter-State commerce which otherwise falls within the Central field. The concept of police power is not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution but is the creation of courts. It is a concept of broad ambit.89 Under it, the States are able to make provisions for general convenience, welfare Page 93 and prosperity of the people. The concept is flexible and it is ultimately for the Courts to decide whether the exercise of this power by a State in a particular case is reasonable or not. In relation to property, police power differs from eminent domain. Whereas eminent domain authorises the government to take property for a 'public use' and for compensation, the concept of police powers authorises the government to adversely affect private property without compensation for the protection of the community, e.g., animals suffering from a contagious disease may be destroyed, or buildings may be demolished to prevent fire from spreading.90 The general concept of 'police power' as it is extant in the U.S.A. has not been adopted in India. The Indian Courts have preferred to interpret the Constitution on its own terms and avoid such a vague and flexible concept as 'police power' which has grown in its own peculiar context in the U.S.A.91 However, without adopting the general concept of 'police power', the State in India could achieve most of what has been achieved in the U.S.A. under that concept. Art. 19(1)(f) read with Art. 19(5) conferred regulatory power on the State which could be utilised for the purpose.92 Under Art. 31(1), a person could be deprived of the property by authority of law, and, as Art. 31(2) stood at the time, no compensation was payable if the State was not acquiring or requisitioning the property. Above all, Art. 31(5)(b)(ii) freed the state from the restraints of Art. 31(2) in respect of legislation enacted for the promotion of public health, or prevention of danger to life or property. These were components of the concept of 'police power' in the U.S.A. Article 31(5) (b)(ii) was held not to protect a law for permanent acquisition of land, even though it might have been enacted to prevent danger to life and property. Such a law had to conform with Art. 31(2). Article 31(5) (b)(ii) protected only a law authorising abatement of public menace by destroying or taking temporary possession of private property, if the peril could not otherwise be abated.93 Article 31(5) (b)(ii) being an exception to Art. 31(2) had to be strictly construed. Thus, acquisition of property for opening a public park, or for erecting dams and embankments, or for town planning, fell under Art. 31(2) and not Art. 31(1)(5)(b)(ii), although the object in such cases was to promote public health.94 This judicial approach was justifiable, otherwise the State might be tempted to bypass Art. 31(2) and acquire property in the name of public health without paying any compensation. Therefore, Art. 31(5)(b)(ii) had to be restricted only to requisitioning of property for a temporary period for abating a public menace. No compensation was payable in such a case. A law extinguishing the right of the owner of an animal in its carcass with a view to destroying it for abating nuisance and preventing danger to public health was held protected under this provision.95 (4) Under Art. 31(5)(b)(iii), Art. 31(2) was not applicable to any law with respect to the property declared to be 'evacuee property' by law. This constitutional provision thus protected the evacuee property legislation enacted after 1947 in the wake of the partition of the country. Evacuee property could be acquired by the State without paying any compensation and Art. 31(2) did not apply.96 Finally in 1978, the 44th Constitutional Amendment removed the Fundamental Right to property by repealing Arts. 32(1) and 31(2). The right to property has now been converted into an ordinary right which can now be regulated by an ordinary law. The Constitutional Amendment in question introduced Art. 300A in the Constitution to give some protection to property. The scope and ambit of Art. 300A has been discussed later in this Chapter. Besides, Arts. 31A, 31B and 31C are still there to curtail property rights. With the repeal of Art. 31(2) in 1978 by the Constitution (Forty-Fourth Amendment) Act,97 all the above propositions of law are no longer applicable except in relation to legislation enacted prior to June 20, 1979, the day the Amendment Act came into force. 1.

M P Jain Indian Constitutional Law/Volume 2/PART V POLITICAL AND CIVIL RIGHTS/CHAPTER XXXII FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS (13) RIGHT TO PROPERTY : PRESENT POSITION CHAPTER XXXII Fundamental Rights (13) Right to Property : Present Position A. INTRODUCTORY After 1978, in the area of property relations, we are left with only four constitutional provisions, viz., Arts. 31A, 31B, 31C and 300A. Arts. 31A, 31B, 31C although included in the Chapter on Fundamental Rights, can hardly be characterised as amounting to Fundamental Rights to property in the real sense, for, these three Page 101 constitutional provisions, in effect, do not confer any rights, but instead seek to impose drastic restrictions on the right to property. The purport of these three provisions is to confer immunity on various types of laws curtailing property rights. Article 300A does confer some semblance of protection on private property, but this constitutional provision does not enjoy the status of a Fundamental Right. B. ARTICLE 31A: SAVING OF LAWS FROM ARTS. 14 AND 19 Abolition of zamindari came first and foremost in the economic programme of the Congress Party which was in power at the Centre and in almost all the States. But payment of compensation posed a particularly difficult problem as it appeared to be beyond the financial resources of the country to pay the just equivalent of the interests to be affected by such a programme. To ensure that agrarian reform legislation did not run into heavy weather, the constitution-framers had provided for an in-built safeguard in the constitutional provisions relating to property, viz., the use of the word 'compensation' in Art. 31(2) without any adjective like 'just' or 'reasonable'. It was thought that this would ensure that compensation need not necessarily be adequate or equal to the property interests affected.1 In course of time, however, this provision proved to be inadequate to immunize land legislation from challenge in the courts. The word 'compensation' by itself standing alone came to be interpreted by the Supreme Court as meaning 'just compensation'.2 Legislation pertaining to land also came to be challenged under other constitutional provisions, especially, Arts. 14 and 19(1)(f). Some land legislation was declared invalid by the High Courts,3e.g., the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950, was held bad under Art. 14, for it classified the zamindars, for the purpose of payment of compensation, in a discriminatory manner. As a result of these judicial pronouncements, the Central Government got apprehensive that the whole zamindari abolition programme would be endangered. To overcome the difficulty, the Constitution was amended and a new provision, Art. 31A, was added by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951.4 To begin with, the scope of the First Amendment was somewhat narrow, viz., to protect the Zamindari Abolition Acts from being attacked under the Fundamental Rights. Art. 31A as added to the Constitution by the First Amendment in 1951 laid down that no law providing for the acquisition by the state of any estate or of any rights therein, or for the extinguishing or modifying any such rights, would be void on the ground of any inconsistency with any of the Fundamental Rights contained in Arts. 14, 19 and 31. As Art. 31 was the only constitutional provision providing for compensation, it would mean that an estate could be acquired or rights therein modified without paying any compensation. However, any such law made by a State Legislature could not be protected under Art. 31A unless it received the assent of the President. In enacting the first Constitutional Amendment, Parliament had an extremely limited vision. While the original Art. 31A smoothened the process of zamindari abolition, it did not immunize legislation dealing with other aspects of agrarian economy, e.g., fixation of ceiling on agricultural holdings in the hands of one person so as to prevent large holdings; the development of village panchayats for effective village planning and management; the consolidation of fragmented holdings. In course of time, it was also felt that protection be extended to some types of industrial law as well, such as, temporarily taking over management of industrial concerns. Hence, the scope of Art.",

    "content": "course of time, it was also felt that protection be extended to some types of industrial law as well, such as, temporarily taking over management of industrial concerns. Hence, the scope of Art. 31A was extended by the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1955, by adding a few more categories of 'deprivation' of property which were to be immune from an attack under Arts. 14, 19 and 31. These categories of laws exempted under Arts. 31A from challenge now extended from the area of agricultural land reform to that of industry and mining. Article 31A is still a part of the Constitution, although with the repeal of Arts. 19(1)(f) and 31, much of the rationale underlying Art. 31A has disappeared. Page 102 Article 31A(1), as enacted in 1955, protected the laws mentioned therein from Arts. 14, 19 and 31. This position stayed till 1978. In 1978, Art. 31 was repealed by the Constitution (Forty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1978, and, therefore, reference to Art. 31 in Art. 31A(1) was dropped. But, for purpose of pre-1979 laws, Art. 31A(1) should be read as containing reference to Art. 31 as well. Article 31A(1) as it stands now after the 44th Amendment says: \"Notwithstanding anything contained in Art. 13\", no law providing for the following \"shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by Article 14 or Article 19\". (a) the acquisition by the state of any 'estate' or of any rights therein or the extinguishment or modification of any such rights; or, (b) the taking over of the management of any property by the State for a limited period either in the public interest or in order to secure its proper management of the property; or (c) the amalgamation of two or more corporations either in the public interest or in order to secure proper management of any of the corporations; or, (d) the extinguishment or modification of any rights of managing agents, secretaries and treasurers, managing directors, directors, or managers of corporations, or of any voting rights of shareholders thereof; or, (e) the extinguishment or modification of any rights accruing by virtue of any agreement, lease or licence for the purpose of searching for, or winning, any mineral or mineral oil, or the premature termination or cancellation of any such agreement, lease or licence. No law providing for any of the above, is to be deemed to be void on the ground of its inconsistency with Art. 14 or 19. The protection of Art. 31A(1) does not apply to a law made by a State Legislature unless it has been reserved for the President's consideration and has received his assent [First Proviso to Art. 31A(1)]. Article 31A(1)(a) has been very active and has generated massive case-law because of the enactment of extensive land legislation to reconstruct agrarian economy. Art. 31A(1)(a) is the protective armour for agricultural land reform laws. Article 31A(1)(a) envisages-- (i) acquisition by the state of 'estate' or of any rights therein; or (ii) extinguishment of the rights of the holder; or (iii) modification of any such right. 'Acquisition' involves transfer of ownership of the property to the state or a corporation owned or controlled by it. 'Extinguishment' signifies complete termination of the rights which can be effectuated without acquisition by the state. In 'modification' also, the state is not the beneficiary. Suspension of rights falls within the term 'modification'.5 A law providing for take-over of management of agricultural land if its full and efficient use is not being made by its owner is not protected by Art. 31A(1)(a) as a mere take-over of management of land by the state cannot be regarded to be acquisition, extinguishment or modification. Take-over of management of agricultural land for a limited period is protected under Art. 31A(1)(b).6 (a) ESTATE The term 'estate' in Art. 31A(1)(a) raises its own problems of connotation. The word 'estate' does not have a uniform meaning throughout the country. Its connotation varies from place to place. Hence, one uniform definition of 'estate' could not have met the situation. To achieve comprehensive agrarian reform throughout the country, it was felt necessary to cover all shades of meaning of the term 'estate'. Accordingly, Art. 31A(2)(a) explains that the term 'estate' would have the same meaning as is given to it by a local law relating to land tenures. Thus, to define the word 'estate' one has to look to the relevant local law and adopt the definition given therein. Even this strategy could not solve all the problems. There could be cases where the local law does not Page 103 define 'estate'. To cover such a situation, Art. 31A(2)(a) says that if in any area the term 'estate' is not defined, then its local equivalent would be included therein. To determine whether a term used in a local law is an 'equivalent' of 'estate' or not, the basic concept of 'estate' has to be kept in view which is that there must be land paying land revenue and held in accordance with a law relating to land tenures. A term corresponding to this basic concept may be taken as the local equivalent of 'estate'.7 Article 31A(2)(a) further explains that the term 'estate' includes any jagir, inam or muafi or other similar grant, and in the States of Madras and Kerala, any janman rights as well [ Art. 31A(2)(a)(i)]. 'Jagir' connotes a State grant which confers on the grantees rights in respect of land revenue with or without rights in the soil. 'Inam' is a holding free or partially free from land revenue with a right in the land as well.8 A grant by the British for services rendered to them falls within this clause.9 In K.",

    "content": "is a holding free or partially free from land revenue with a right in the land as well.8 A grant by the British for services rendered to them falls within this clause.9 In K. Kunhi Koman v. State of Kerala, 10 the Supreme Court held that the local law in South Canara so defined the term 'estate' as not to include ryotwari tenures and, therefore, a law seeking to acquire ryotwari land was not protected by Art. 31A(1)(a), and it could be tested under Art. 14.11 To overcome this difficulty, the Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act, 1964,12 added two new clauses. Art. 31A(2)(a)(ii) brings 'ryotwari' settlement within the term 'estate' and Art. 31A(2)(a)(iii) brings \"any land held or let for purposes of agriculture or for purposes ancillary thereto, including waste or vacant land, forest land, land for pasture or sites of buildings and other structures occupied by cultivators of land, agricultural labourers and village artisans within the term \"estate'\".13 In this way, the connotation of 'estate' has been very much broadened and the entire corpus of agrarian land legislation has now been immunized from challenge under Arts. 14 and 19. However, if some land does not fall within the term 'estate' as defined in Art. 31A(2)(i) and (ii), and is also not held or let for purposes of agriculture or ancillary purposes, then it falls outside the scope of Art. 31A(1)(a).14 Article 31A(1)(a) also uses the expression 'rights in relation to an estate' which, according to Art. 31A(2)(b), includes any rights vesting in a proprietor, sub-proprietor, under-proprietor, tenure-holder, raiyat, under-raiyat, or other intermediary and any rights or privileges in respect of land revenue. Thus, the terms 'estate' and 'rights in estates' have been used in Art. 31A(1)(a) in their widest amplitude and cover all possible kinds of rights in estates. This was necessary to save legislation for agrarian reform. (b) SCOPE OF ART. 31A(1)(A) The protection afforded by this provision to agrarian legislation is very broad. It is a complete answer to any challenge under Arts. 14 and 19. It protects a law even if it is confiscatory or discriminatory, or compensation payable under it is illusory. Thus, any tenancy legislation, howsoever drastic, is protected under Art. 31A(1)(a). The following are some examples of the laws which have been held to be protected under Art. 31A(1)(a): (i) a law extinguishing 'inams' and subjecting all 'inam' lands to land revenue without providing any compensation;15 (ii) a law transferring agricultural land from the landlords to the tenants and making them full owners which was tantamount to extinguishing the rights of the landlords in the estate and conferring the same upon the tenants;16 (iii) a law fixing ceiling on agricultural land;17 (iv) a legal provision authorising the collector to annul leases with retrospective effect.18 (v) The Bihar Land Reforms Act empowered the collector to annul anticipatory transfers of land designed to defeat the object of the Act. The provision was held valid although it did not by itself extinguish or modify any rights in an estate.19 (vi) Power given to collectors to annul transfers made by landholders to defeat the provisions of law was held non-challengeable on the ground of lack of procedural safeguards.20 (vii) A law abolishing big landed estates.21 Prima facie, Art. 31A(1)(a) appears to be applicable to all kinds of 'extinguishment' or 'modification' of estates Page 104 for whatever purpose. But in Kochunni,22 the Supreme Court read down this provision and held that its purpose was to facilitate 'agrarian reforms' and, therefore, it would protect only such legislation as had reference to agrarian reform. Art. 31A(1)(a) deprived the citizens of their Fundamental Rights and such a provision could not be extended, by interpretation to overreach the object implicit therein. Since then, the view has become established that Art. 31A(1)(a) does not protect legislation which has no relation to agrarian reform.23 The Court will extend protection of Art. 31A(1)(a) to a law only when it feels satisfied that its purpose is to effect some agrarian reform. The expression 'agrarian reform', however, is interpreted broadly. It covers rural development, raising of economic standards, bettering of rural health and social conditions. The concept of agrarian reform is complex and dynamic; it is wider than mere conventional reorganisation of the land system or distribution of land. It involves restructuring of village life itself taking in its broad embrace the socioeconomic regeneration of the rural population.24 In Kochunni, the Supreme Court held that a law regulating inter se the rights of a proprietor in his estate and the junior members of the family were not protected by Art. 31A(1)(a) as it had no reference to agrarian reform. The law merely sought to compel a proprietor to divide his self-acquired property between himself and other members of his family, and, thus, created interest in land in favour of persons other than tenants, who had none before. Art. 31A(1)(a) did not empower the State to divest a proprietor of his estate and vest it in another without reference to any agrarian reform. In Vajravelu,25 a law providing for acquisition of land for urban development, such as, slum clearance, housing schemes, creation of modern suburbs near towns, could not be protected under Art. 31A(1)(a) as it had no relation to agrarian reform. The Court emphasized that if the State were enabled to acquire land of citizens without reference to any agrarian reform in derogation of their Fundamental Rights without payment of compensation, Art. 31(2) would practically become a dead letter. In Balmadies,26 a legal provision vesting private forests on 'Janman' land in the State was held not protected by Art. 31A(1)(a) in the absence of any material to show that this was linked in any manner with a scheme of agrarian reform or bettering village economy. Mere transfer of land to the State does not show that the object of transfer was to bring about agrarian reform. On the other hand, acquisition of forests for promotion of agriculture, or the welfare of agricultural population is protected by Art.",

    "content": "transfer of land to the State does not show that the object of transfer was to bring about agrarian reform. On the other hand, acquisition of forests for promotion of agriculture, or the welfare of agricultural population is protected by Art. 31A(1)(a).27 Abolition of intermediaries between the State and the cultivator and helping the actual cultivator by establishing direct relationship between him and the State, is a measure of agrarian reform for purposes of protection under Art. 31A(1)(a).28 Godavari Sugar Mills v. S.B. Kamble29 is the most significant pronouncement in this area. A law was passed to impose ceiling on land. The surplus land acquired from landlords was to be distributed among landless persons and poor peasants. However, the surplus land acquired from industrial undertakings being used by them to produce raw materials for manufacture of goods was to be allotted to the State Farming Corporation for production of raw materials. The scheme, it was argued, was not for agrarian reform in so far as land was vested in a State corporation. It was stressed that allotment of land to the landless or the poor agriculturists was an essential attribute of agricultural reforms but not allotment of land to a State corporation. The Supreme Courtrejected the argument. The main purpose of the Act was to prevent concentration of agricultural land in the hands of a few. It sought to remove economic imbalance by taking surplus land from the holders in excess of the ceiling. The bulk of the land thus acquired was being distributed to the landless persons. Retaining a few blocks of land for cultivation of raw materials for industrial undertakings was meant to avoid fragmentation of this land and also to ensure that manufacturers were not starved of raw materials. This provision could not be detached from the rest of the Act, the general scheme of which was to bring about agrarian reform. It was true that acquisition simpliciter of land by the State to augment its resources and without specifying the purpose for which it was to be used after acquisition would not get the protection of Art. 31A. But vesting of some land in the State would not militate against the object of agrarian reform if it is a part of the general scheme of agrarian reform and there was no oblique deviation from the avowed purpose. It was necessary to look at the general scheme of the Act acquiring land, object of acquisition, reasons for retaining land with the State and not distributing it among the poor peasants. Page 105 The Court emphasized that the concept of agrarian reform was not static. \"With the change of times under the impact of fresh ideas and in the context of fresh situations, the concept of agrarian reform is bound to acquire new dimensions. A measure which has the effect of improving the rural economy or promoting rural welfare would be a part of agrarian reform.\"30 Once a law is found to have relation to agrarian reform, it is protected by Art. 31A(1)(a), no matter how drastic its provisions may be. In State of Kerala v. Gwalior Rayon & Silk Mfg. Co. Ltd .,31 a law enacted in 1971 vested forest lands in the State without compensation and, thus, lands having standing timber worth crores of rupees were taken away without any compensation at all. At that time, Art. 31A(1)(a) provided protection against Art. 31(2) which guaranteed compensation. The Court held the Act valid under Art. 31A(1)(a) as a measure of agrarian reform treating forest lands as agricultural lands. The Court emphasized that once \"the legislative area is barricaded by Art. 31A, it cannot be breached by Arts. 14, 19 and 31.\" The Supreme Court held in Kunjukutty v. State of Kerala, 32 that Art. 31A(1)(a) would not protect the acquisition of money or a debt. Kerala passed a law to give relief to agriculturists against arrears of rent accrued before a specified date. For instance, a tenant possessing 5 acres or less of land was to be discharged from the arrears of rent payable by him by paying one year's rent, or the actual rent whichever might be less. Similar provisions giving relief to tenants with larger pieces of land were also made. The Court held that the law was not protected under Art. 31A(1)(a). Rent to accrue in future was a legal incident of the property and the right to receive the same could be regarded as a right in land. But the rent already due was a debt and not an interest in land. Even if under the prevailing law, the rent due constituted a charge on land and therefore an interest in land, it could still not be regarded as 'right' in land and could not thus be extinguished as 'estate'. Besides, liability to pay rent was also a personal liability which made it a debt. Acquisition or extinguishment of such a personal liability was not covered by Art. 31A. Art. 31A would not come into play when a right in the land was not being acquired. Art. 31A could not protect acquisition of money and thus acquisition of arrears of rent fell outside the protection of Art. 31A. The provision in question was held to partake prima facie of \"the character of forfeiture or confiscation of the discharged arrears.\" (c) SECOND PROVISO The Seventeenth Amendment in 1964, while seeking to expand the concept of 'estate',33 also added the second proviso imposing one limitation, viz.; the land held by a person under his personal cultivation up to the ceiling fixed by law, or any building or structure standing thereon, or as appurtenant thereto, would not be 'acquired' by the state unless the law provides for compensation not less than its market value. This means that the land of the cultivators within the ceiling fixed by law cannot be acquired without at least paying compensation at the market value. Any law contravening this provision would be void.",

    "content": "means that the land of the cultivators within the ceiling fixed by law cannot be acquired without at least paying compensation at the market value. Any law contravening this provision would be void. This provision seeks to confer some protection on small cultivators having small pieces of agricultural land for self-cultivation. If their land is acquired, they should at least be compensated at the market value of the land. The legislature may however pay more if it so likes. But the extremely restrictive nature of this provision needs to be emphasized. First, for this provision to apply, there must necessarily be a law fixing the ceiling on agricultural land. Without there being a ceiling law, this provision cannot apply even if a person is in personal cultivation of his land.34 Secondly, the prohibition of the second proviso operates only in case of land within the ceiling fixed under the law as existing at a given time. The proviso has nothing to do with what the ceiling limit should be. It comes into effect only after the ceiling has been prescribed by law. The legislature can thus vary the ceiling. Once a ceiling is fixed by law, it is not static or unalterable for all times. New ceiling limit may be fixed by a new law. The ceiling can be lowered by another law and there is no question of paying any compensation. It is only when land in personal cultivation which is within the ceiling as fixed under the existing law, is acquired that the compensation has to be paid at the market value. Lowering of ceiling by law does not earn any right to compensation at market price under this provision.35 Thirdly, it is only when land is 'acquired' that the proviso in question comes into operation. If there is no 'acquisition' but 'deprivation' in any way, then the provision does not operate. Thus, reservation of some Page 106 portion of the land of cultivators having land within the ceiling for the income of the panchayat, falls within the proviso as it is a case of acquisition. For this, compensation at market price has to be paid for the land reserved.36 But, lands of cultivators reserved on a pro rata basis for common purposes of the land-owners, is not 'acquisition' by the State and, thus, falls outside the scope of the provision in question. The beneficiaries of the lands taken away are the proprietors and not the State and so it does not amount to 'acquisition'.37 This appears to be too technical a view to take. It is arguable whether this approach accords with the spirit of the provision in question. It stands to reason whether a distinction can legitimately be drawn between a panchayat and the proprietors who constitute the former. S. Section 25 of the Land Acquisition Act has been held to be unconstitutional as regards the actual tillers of the soil. Under the Proviso to Art. 31(1), the cultivators have the right to be paid full market value for their land. The State cannot acquire their lands for less than the market value.38 Talking of the proviso in question, the Supreme Court observed in D.G. Mahajan v. State of Maharashtra :39 \"A great right is created in favour of the owners to get compensation at not less than the market value if lands within the ceiling limit and in personal cultivation are acquired by the State. This is a Fundamental Right and is a creature of the second proviso to Art. 31A.\" (d) ART. 31A(1)(b) Article 31A(1)(b) seeks to protect the state against a claim for compensation, and from a challenge to the law under Arts. 14 and 19, in a situation like that of Sholapur Mills, where taking over of the management of mills through Government nominated directors was held bad in the absence of payment of compensation to the mills.40 The state is now protected from any liability in case it takes over, for a temporary period, management of any property in public interest, or to secure its proper management. Management of any property can be taken over by the state for a temporary period without paying any compensation. Take-over of management of property should be for a limited, and not for an unlimited, period. There should, therefore, be a time-limit on such take-over. Without a time-limit, a take-over of management would be an excuse for deprivation of property without compensation and that is not the intention of Art. 31A(1)(b). The constitutional provision protects neither a take-over of management for an unlimited period nor a permanent deprivation of property.41 Thus, a law to take over management of coal mines for a limited period in order to secure their proper management falls under Art. 31A(1)(b).42 The scope of Art. 31A(1)(b) has been discussed by the Supreme Court in Union of India v. Elphinstone Spinning and Weaving Co. Ltd.43 The Court has emphasized that the Article provides for taking over of the management of any property, movable or immovable, agricultural or non-agricultural for 'a limited period' without being obliged to justify its action in a Court of law, with reference to Art. 14 or 19. The necessary conditions for the application of the Article, therefore, are that the taking over in question must be for a limited period as distinguished from any indefinite period and such taking over must be either in the public interest, or in order to secure the proper management of the property. The validity of any law attracting Art. 31A(1)(b) cannot be questioned on the ground of its violation of Arts. 14 and 19 of the Constitution. A law enabling taking-over of a sick mill pending its nationalisation has been held to be a law providing for taking over of the management for a limited period in public interest and such law falls within the purview of Art. 31A(1)(b). Therefore, the validity of such a law cannot be assailed under Arts.",

A law enabling taking-over of a sick mill pending its nationalisation has been held to be a law providing for taking over of the management for a limited period in public interest and such law falls within the purview of Art. 31A(1)(b). Therefore, the validity of such a law cannot be assailed under Arts. 14 and 19 of the Constitution.44 A State take-over of management of municipal schools along with all their property ostensibly for ten years was held to be not protected by Art. 31A(1)(b), because it was not only taking over management, but the entire property, movable and immovable, pertaining to the schools became vested in the State which was no less than requisitioning of property. Take-over in fact appeared to be for good as there was no provision for an automatic re-transfer of these properties to the schools after the lapse of ten years for which the management or the schools was sought to be taken over.45 Page 107 (e) ARTS. 31A(1)(C) & 31A(1)(D) These provisions protect changes introduced in the company law to eliminate the managing agency system, or to provide for compulsory amalgamation of two or more companies in the national interests, transfer of an undertaking from one company to another. Article 31A(1)(c) has been held to extend to cooperative societies as well. The Court gave a broad interpretation to the word 'corporation' used in the constitutional provision.46 (f) ART. 31A(1)(E) Article 31A(1)(e) has been introduced to enable the state, in the interest of national economy, to have full control over the oil and mineral resources of the country. A law enabling the state to cancel prospecting licences, mining leases or other similar agreements, or to modify their terms, is now protected from being challenged under Arts. 14 and 19. Legislation providing for suspension of the rights of a mineowner or lessee of a mine for a certain period has been held to be covered by the term 'modification.'47 Adverse modification in the terms of a mining lease, or premature termination of a lease for extracting minerals, is provided by Art. 31A(1)(e). A view has been expressed that under Art. 31A(1)(e), the acquisition of mines and minerals can be for the purpose of searching for, or winning, any mineral and not for mineral development.48 C. ARTICLE 31B: VALIDATION OF CERTAIN LAWS Article 31B along with the Ninth Schedule was added to the Constitution by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951.49 Article 31B provides that the Acts and Regulations mentioned in the Ninth Schedule shall not be deemed to be void, or ever to have become void, in spite of any adverse judicial pronouncement, on the ground that they are inconsistent with, or that they take away or abridge, any of the Fundamental Rights. The provision thus immunizes the various pieces of legislation included in the Ninth Schedule from an attack on the ground of their non-conformity with any of the Fundamental Rights. No Act mentioned in the Ninth Schedule can be invalidated on the ground of its violation of any other Fundamental Right.50 Not only this, Art. 31B is retrospective in nature. When a statute declared unconstitutional by a Court is later included in the Ninth Schedule, it is to be considered as having been in that Schedule from its inception. The Act cannot then be deemed to be void, or ever to have become void, on the ground of its inconsistency with any Fundamental Right.51 In short, the judicial decision is nullified when the statute is included in the Schedule. Article 31B contains a device for saving laws from challenge on the ground of violation of Fundamental Rights. The scope of Art. 31B is wider than Art. 31A in so far as any law included in the Ninth Schedule is immunized from all Fundamental Rights whether or not the law falls under any of the categories in Art. 31A. Art. 31B is thus not controlled by Art. 31A. The protection of Art. 31B extends to the Act in question as it stands on the date on which it was included in the Ninth Schedule. This means that when an Act is included in the Schedule, all the amendments made therein till the date of its inclusion in the Schedule are protected. It is not necessary to separately mention these amendments in the Schedule.52 The protection of Art. 31B does not however extend to any amendment to any Act after the date of its inclusion in the Schedule. Such an amendment has to be adjudged on its own merits. The reason for this view is that an Act is included in the Schedule by the process of constitutional amendment which requires a special majority in the two Houses of Parliament, while an amendment to the Act is made by the Legislature Page 108 by the ordinary legislative process. To immunize statutory amendments by extending the effect of the Ninth Schedule would be tantamount to giving to the Legislature a power to amend the Constitution by ordinary procedure.53 The Supreme Courthas also repudiated the view that the protection of Art. 31B can be extended to any subsequent provision inserted in the protected Act by its amendment on the ground that it is 'ancillary or incidental' to the provisions which have already been protected by inclusion in the Ninth Schedule. Art. 31B makes an inroad into the Fundamental Rights and, therefore, in the very nature of things, it should be construed very strictly. The frontiers of the protected zone should not be extended beyond what the language of Art. 31B warrants. Therefore, the protection of Art. 31B would not extend to any provisions made subsequent to the inclusion of an Act in the Ninth Schedule, and it does not matter whether the subsequent provisions deal with new substantive matters, or with matters which are incidental or ancillary to those already protected.54 Article 31B represents a novel, innovative, and drastic technique of constitutional amendment.",

    "content": "enactments are incorporated into the Constitution and immunized against all attack on the ground of breach of any of the Fundamental Rights.55A blanket protection is thus given to the statutes mentioned in the Ninth Schedule howsoever violative of the Fundamental Rights they may be. Even an Act declared unconstitutional is revived by inclusion in the Ninth Schedule. Such a technique of constitutional amendment is open to serious objections. The State enactments immunized by inclusion in the Ninth Schedule are not critically examined by any one as to the principles and policies underlying them.56 The proper technique of constitutional amendment should be to lay down broad principles and then leave it to the courts to work out their implications and apply them to concrete situations. On this view of the matter, Art. 31B appears to be an unjustifiable technique of constitutional amendment. Since 1951, the Ninth Schedule has been expanded constantly so much so that to-day 284 Acts are included therein. From the context of Art. 31B--it is put under the heading right to property immediately after Art. 31 and 31A, and its opening words are \"Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in Art. 31A\"--it could plausibly be assumed that Art. 31B was meant to protect legislation dealing with property rights and not any other type of legislation. But, in practice, Art. 31B has been used to invoke protection for many laws not concerned with property rights at all. Art. 31B is thus being used beyond the socioeconomic purposes which was its only justification. In Waman Rao v. Union of India, 57 the Supreme Court has ruled by majority that all amendments to the Constitution made before 24th April, 1973 (the date on which Kesavananda was decided),58 and by which the Ninth Schedule was amended from time to time by the inclusion of various Acts and Regulations therein were valid and constitutional. But amendments made on or after 24th April, 1973, which amended the IX Schedule by including various Acts or Regulations therein were \"open to challenge on the ground that they, or any one or more of them, are beyond the constituent power of the Parliament since they damage the basic and essential features of the Constitution or its basic structure\". The Court in Waman Rao has not pronounced upon the validity of such subsequent constitutional amendments except to say that \"if any Act or Regulation included in the Ninth Schedule by a constitutional amendment made after April 24, 1973, is saved by Art. 31A, or by Art. 31C, as it stood prior to its amendment by the Forty Second Amendment, the challenge to the relevant constitutional amendment by which that Act or Regulation is put in the Ninth Schedule on the ground that the amendment damages or destroys a basic or essential feature of the constitution or its basic structure as reflected in Arts. 14, 19 or 31, will become otiose\". Chandrachud, C.J., said in his judgment in Waman Rao that laws and regulations included in the IX Schedule before 24th April, 1973, could not be challenged on the ground of being inconsistent with a Fundamental Right. But Acts and Regulations included in the IX Schedule after 24th April, 1973 would not be protected by Art. 31B for the simple reason that because of Kesavananda decision there would be no justification for making additions to the IX Schedule with a view to confer a blanket protection on the laws included therein. He further observed: \"The various constitutional amendments by which additions were Page 109 made to the Ninth Schedule on or after April 24, 1973, will be valid only if they do not damage or destroy the basic structure of the Constitution.\" According to Bhagwati, J., also \"all constitutional amendments made after the decision in Kesavananda Bharti's case would have to be treated by reference to the basic structure doctrine.\" Bhagwati, J., added further that \"in every case where a constitutional amendment includes a statute or statutes in the Ninth Schedule, its constitutional validity would have to be considered by reference to the basic structure doctrine and such constitutional amendment would be liable to be declared invalid to the extent to which it damages or destroys the basic structure of the Constitution by according protection against violation of any particular Fundamental Right.\" The above judicial observations in Waman Rao exhibit some inconsistencies, viz., whether an Act or Regulation which, or a part of which, is or has been found by the Supreme Court to be violative of any of the Arts. 14, 19 and 31 can be included in the Ninth Schedule, or whether it is only a constitutional amendment amending the IX Schedule that damages or destroys the basic structure of the Constitution that can be struck down. In I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu, a constitutional bench of the Supreme Court consisting of five Judges has referred this matter for decision to a larger bench of nine Judges.59 The propriety of having a provision like Art. 31B read with Schedule IX is highly questionable. No Act mentioned in the Schedule can be invalidated on the ground of its violation with any Fundamental Right. A blanket protection is given to the statutes mentioned in Schedule IX howsoever violative of Fundamental Rights it may be. Even when an Act is declared unconstitutional it is revived as soon as it is included in Schedule IX. Thus, judicial review on the ground of Fundamental Rights is completely excluded as soon as an Act is put in Schedule IX. The Schedule has at present 284 statutes listed therein which have been totally immunized from the effect of the Fundamental Rights. The Supreme Court has asserted time and again that judicial review constitutes the basic structure or feature of the Constitution.60 The serious question thus arises: how are Art. 31B and Schedule IX which exclude hundreds of all and sundry Acts from the scope of judicial review on the ground of breach of Fundamental Rights, especially Art.",

    "content": "Schedule has at present 284 statutes listed therein which have been totally immunized from the effect of the Fundamental Rights. The Supreme Court has asserted time and again that judicial review constitutes the basic structure or feature of the Constitution.60 The serious question thus arises: how are Art. 31B and Schedule IX which exclude hundreds of all and sundry Acts from the scope of judicial review on the ground of breach of Fundamental Rights, especially Art. 14, the right to equality, which has also been declared as a basic feature, constitutionally valid? All said and done, it seems necessary to reconsider the question of the validity of Art. 31B, especially, after the Supreme Court's pronouncement in L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India, 61 where the Court has unequivocally asserted in relation to Art. 323B:62 \"We, therefore, hold that the power of judicial review over legislative action vested in the High Courts under Art. 226 and in this Court under Art. 32 of the Constitution is an integral and essential feature of the Constitution, constituting part of its basic structure. Ordinarily, therefore, the power of the High Courts and the Supreme Court to test the Constitutional validity of legislation can never be ousted or excluded.\" One may raise the question: how is Art. 31B compatible with the above assertion of the Supreme Court? There is also another serious question to be considered: can an Act which infringes, a basic feature of the Constitution be validated by including it in Schedule IX? In substance, it amounts to validating an Amendment of the Constitution which infringes the basic feature of the Constitution, something which the constituent power in India cannot achieve. Certain aspects of these questions have been recently recognized and a nine Judge Bench was constituted for determining the nature and character of protection provided under article 31B of the Constitution made after 24-4-1973 i.e. the date on which the judgment in Kesavananda Bharati63 was delivered. As the judgment itself records, the fundamental question faced by the Court is \"whether on and after 24-4-1973 when the basic structure doctrine was propounded, it is permissible for Parliament to immunise legislations from fundamental rights by inserting them into the Ninth Schedule and, if so, what is its effect on the power of judicial review of the Court\".64 After elaborate discussion and considering various jurisprudential concepts regarding constitutionalism and principles of constitutionality [whether such arguments were necessary or Page 110 not] the Court noted that Article 31B only provides restricted immunity and it seemed that the original intent was only to protect a limited number of laws [referring thereby to laws relating to agrarian reforms] But, the Court also noted that from the 13 initial laws which were inserted in the Ninth Schedule the number had gone upto 284 over the years which showed that \"it is no longer a mere exception\". It was observed that the absence of guidelines for exercise of such powers meant the absence of constitutional control which results in destruction of constitutional supremacy at the cost of parliamentary hegemony as well as denial of full powers of judicial review conferred by the Constitution [ Art. 32 and Art. 226] to determine the constitutional validity of such exercise. The Court clearly stated that Part-III is amendable but subject to the basic structure doctrine. This judgment is an authoritative precedent for the proposition that Articles 14, 15, 19 and 21 are part of the basic structure of the constitution.65Coelhio, in substance, does not lay down any new principle as such since the basic issue had already been decided in Waman Rao.66 It may, however, be of some relevance as an overview of the constitutional limitations on the powers of the parliament and the state legislatures. It also recognizes Minerva Mills67 on the question of the balancing of Part --II and Part -IV of the Constitution. Ultimately the Court, while concluding pointed out what the Court had held. They are: (i) A law that abrogates or abridges rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution may violate the basic structure doctrine or it may not. If former is the consequence of the law, whether by amendment of any article of Part III or by an insertion in the Ninth Schedule, such law will have to be invalidated in exercise of judicial review power of the Court. The validity or invalidity would be tested on the principles laid down in this judgment. (ii) The majority judgment in Kesavananda Bharati case68 read with Indira Gandhi case69 requires the validity of each new constitutional amendment to be judged on its own merits. The actual effect and impact of the law on the rights guaranteed under Part III has to be taken into account for determining whether or not it destroys basic structure. The impact test would determine the validity of the challenge. (iii) All amendments to the Constitution made on or after 24-4-1973 by which the Ninth Schedule is amended by inclusion of various laws therein shall have to be tested on the touchstone of the basic or essential features of the Constitution as reflected in Article 21 read with Articles 14, Article 19 and the principles underlying them. To put it differently even though an Act is put in the ninth Schedule by a constitutional amendment its provisions would be open to attack on the ground that they destroy or damage the basic structure if the fundamental right or rights taken away or abrogated pertains or pertain to the basic structure.",

    "content": "Justification for conferring protection, not blanket protection, on the laws included in the Ninth Schedule by constitutional amendments shall be a matter of constitutional adjudication by examining the nature and extent of infraction of a fundamental right by a statute, sought to be constitutionally protected, and on the touchstone of the basic structure doctrine as reflected in Article 21 read with Article 14 and Article 19 by application of the \"rights test\" and the \"essence of the right\" test taking the synoptic view of the articles in Part III as held in Indira Gandhi case. Applying the above tests to the Ninth Schedule laws, if the infraction affects the basic structure then such laws(s) will not get the protection of the Ninth Schedule; D. ARTICLE 31C (a) AS INTRODUCED IN 1971 The Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution in 197170 added a new clause, Art. 31C, to the Constitution. Originally, Art. 31C ran as follows: \"Notwithstanding anything contained in Art. 13, no law giving effect to the policy of the State towards securing the principles specified in clause (b) or clause (c) of Art. 39 shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by Art. 14, Art. 19 or Art. 31; and no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy shall be called in question in any Court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy.\" Page 111 Up to the year 1971, the position was that Fundamental Rights prevailed over the Directive Principles of State policy,71 and that a law enacted to implement a Directive Principle could not be valid if it conflicted with a Fundamental Right. Art. 31C sought to change this relationship to some extent by conferring primacy on Arts. 39(b) and 39(c)72 over Arts. 14, 19 and 31. Article 31C was of a drastic character. The avowed objective underlying Art. 31C was to usher in the country at an early date the era of a socialist pattern of society.73 Art. 31C had two parts. The first part protected a law giving effect to the policy of the state towards securing the principles specified in Arts. 39(b) and (c) from being challenged on the ground of infringement of the Fundamental Rights under Arts. 14, 19 and 31. Thus, Art. 31C was much broader than Art. 31A. While Art. 31A was limited to specified topics,74 Art. 31C was not so limited. It did not lay down specific heads which were immunized but left a general power to the State Legislatures to select any topic or adopt any measures which might purport to have some nexus with the objectives underlying Arts. 39(b) & 39(c). Art. 31C thus dealt with objects with unlimited scope. The second part of Art. 31C originally sought to oust the jurisdiction of the courts to find out whether the law in question gave effect to the principles of Arts. 39(b) and 39(c). It said that when the law in question made a declaration that the law was to give effect to the policy underlying Arts. 39(b) and 39(c), the courts would be debarred from reviewing the same even if the law might not, in reality, be concerning Arts. 39(b) and 39(c). The constitutional validity of Art. 31C was challenged in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala .75 The Supreme Court held by a majority that while the first limb of Art. 31C was valid, its second limb (italicised words) was invalid. Thus, a declaration as mentioned in the original Art. 31C could not be conclusive. The Court must consider, notwithstanding the declaration, whether there was a nexus between the Act and the policy of the Directive Principles in Arts. 39(b) and (c). If the Court came to the conclusion that the declaration was merely a pretence and that the real purpose of the law was the accomplishment of some object other than to give effect to the policy underlying Arts. 39(b) and (c), the declaration could not debar the Court from striking down any provision therein violating Arts. 14, 19, and 31. This means that while a law enacted to implement Arts. 39(b) and (c) would not be challengeable under Arts. 14 and 19, the courts do have the power to go into the question whether the law in question does really achieve these objectives or not. Thus, when a law is challenged, the courts would have the power to consider whether it could reasonably be described as a law giving effect to the policy of the state towards securing the said aims. The law to be unquestionable under Art. 31C must have some nexus with the objectives mentioned in Arts. 39(b) and (c). Whenever a question is raised that the Legislature has abused its power and inserted a declaration in law not for giving effect to Arts. 39(b) and 39(c), the Court has necessarily to go into this question and decide the issue. If the Court finds that the declaration is merely a pretence and the real purpose of the law is to accomplish some object other than effectuating the policy underlying Art. 39(b) or 39(c), the declaration could not bar the Court from striking down the provision as being inconsistent with Art. 14 or 19. As Mathew, J., has observed in Kesavananda:76 \"...if a law passed ostensibly to give effect to the policy of the State is, in truth and substance, one for accomplishing an unauthorised object, the Court would be entitled to tear the veil created by the declaration and decide according to the real nature of the law.\" Article 31C could not give protection to a law which has merely some remote or tenuous connection with a directive principle. The last limb of Art. 31C being invalid, no legislature by its own declaration could make the law challenge proof. The ruling has several positive aspects. By upholding the first limb of Art.",

    "content": "last limb of Art. 31C being invalid, no legislature by its own declaration could make the law challenge proof. The ruling has several positive aspects. By upholding the first limb of Art. 31C, the legislatures in India have been conceded greater power to implement the socialist socio-economic programmes. Invalidation of the second limb of Art. 31C avoids the possibility of the State Legislatures immunizing all sorts of laws from judicial scrutiny. To permit each and every legislature to enact review proof legislation in the name of Arts. 39(b) and (c), could have led to socioeconomic chaos in the country. Page 112 (b) AS AMENDED IN 1976 In 1976, Art. 31C was amended, its scope further expanded, and it was sought to be made much more drastic, through the Forty-second Amendment.77 The first part of Art. 31C now said that no law giving effect to any of the Directive Principles would be deemed to be void on the ground of its inconsistency with Arts. 14 and 19. Thus, the 42nd Amendment gave primacy to all the Directive Principles, and not only to Arts. 39(b) and 39(c), over Arts. 14 and 19. The scope of Art. 31C was thus made much wider than what it was before 1976 when it referred only to Arts. 39(b) and 39(c). Now Art. 31C referred to all the Directive Principles. It will, thus, be seen that while before 1971, Fundamental Rights had precedence over the Directive Principles, after 1976, this scenario has undergone a drastic change as all Directive Principles came to have precedence over Arts. 14 and 19.78 This change was sought to be justified on the ground that the rights of the community must prevail over the rights of the individual. In response to this argument, it must be asserted that the idea underlying the concept of Fundamental Rights is that there are certain inherent rights in an individual which the society cannot take away. To give precedence to the society over the individual all through could lead to a totalitarian regime in the country. More has been said on this point later in the Chapter on Directive Principles.79 In the new expanded form giving precedence to all Directive Principles over the Fundamental Rights could Art. 31C be regarded as constitutionally valid? In Minerva Mills,80 the extended version of Art. 31C was struck down by the Supreme Court. The Court ruled that the extension of the shield of Art. 31C to all the Directive Principles was beyond the amending power of Parliament under Art. 368, because by giving primacy to all Directive Principles over the Fundamental Rights in Arts. 14 and 19, the basic or essential feature of the Constitution, viz., judicial review has been destroyed. In Waman Rao v. Union of India, 81 also the Supreme Court maintained that Art. 31C, as it stood prior to the 42nd Amendment made in 1976, was valid as its constitutionality had been upheld in Kesavananda. But, in Sanjeev82, the Supreme Court dissenting from Minerva Mills opined that \"the question of the constitutional validity of Art. 31C appears to us to be concluded by the decision in Kesavananda Bharati's case.\" But this observation appears to be an obiter dicta and not conclusive on the question of the validity of Art. 31C because in Kesavananda, Art. 31C was partly held valid and partly invalid, and then Art. 31C referred to only two clauses of Art. 39 and not wholesale to all Directive Principles. To begin with, Art. 31C was of a limited scope; after 1976, its dimension became much too much enlarged, drastically curtailing the scope of judicial review and also that of the Fundamental Rights. In Kessavananda, the Supreme Court never considered the question of constitutional validity of this extended version of Art. 31C. Also, the statute in question involved in Sanjeev was enacted in 1972 when Art. 31C stood as enacted in 1971 and, therefore, any discussion on the validity of 31C in its extended version was not at all called for. The fact-situation raised no such question and, therefore, the judicial opinion expressed in Sanjeev was nothing more than casual and gratuitous.83 The matter has been considered in detail at a later stage. The prevalent view seems to be the same as was expressed by the Supreme Court in Minerva.84 (c) PRESENT POSITION It may, however, be noted that the declaration made in the law as envisaged in Art. 31C is not conclusive. The Court can go behind the declaration and ascertain whether the law in question gives effect to the policy underlying the Directive Principle concerned. \"It is settled proposition of law that notwithstanding the declaration by the Legislature that the Act has been made to implement the Directive Principles specified in Art. 39, it would be open to the Court to ignore such a declaration in a given case and examine the constitutional validity of the Act. The declaration cannot act as a cloak to protect the law bearing no relationship with the objectives contained in Article 39 of the Constitution\".85 Page 113 In order to decide whether a law gives effect to the policy of the State towards securing the Directive Principles specified in Art. 39(b) or 39(c), a Court will have to examine the pith and substance, the true nature and character of the law as also its design and the subject-matter dealt with by it together with its object and scope.86 For a law to get the protection of Art. 31C, the Court has to determine whether there is a connection between the law in question and Art. 39. There should be a 'real and substantial' connection. To determine whether the law satisfies this test, the Court would have to examine the pith and substance, the true nature and character of the law as also its design and the subject-matter dealt with by it together with its object and scope.",

    "content": "the Court has to determine whether there is a connection between the law in question and Art. 39. There should be a 'real and substantial' connection. To determine whether the law satisfies this test, the Court would have to examine the pith and substance, the true nature and character of the law as also its design and the subject-matter dealt with by it together with its object and scope. If the Court finds that the dominant object of the law is to give effect to the Directive Principle, it would accord protection to the law under Art. 31C. But if the law, though passed seemingly for effectuating the Directive Principle is, in pith and substance, one for accomplishing an unauthorised purpose not covered by the Directive Principle, then such law would not have the protection of Art. 31C. In such a case, the Court is entitled to tear the veil created by the declaration and decide according to the real nature of the law. If the Court finds that the law though passed seemingly for giving effect to the Directive Principle is, in pith and substance, one for accomplishing an unauthorised purpose--unauthorised in the sense of not being covered by the Directive Principle, such law would not have the protection of Art. 31C. This Article does not give protection to a law which has merely some remote or tenuous connection with the Directive Principle. What is necessary is that there must be real and substantial connection and the dominant object of the law must be to give effect to the Directive Principles in Arts. 39(b) and 39(c). Also, even where the dominant object of the law is to effectuate Art. 39(b) or 39(c), it is not every provision thereof which is entitled to protection. The words of Art. 31C, on a plain, natural construction do not include all the provisions of the law but only those which give effect to the Directive Principle. On this point, Bhagwati, J., has observed in Minerva:87 \"....It is not every provision of a statute which has been enacted with the dominant object of giving effect to a directive principle, that is entitled to protection, but only those provisions of the statute which are basically and essentially necessary for giving effect to the directive principles are protected under the amended Art. 31-C.\" The Supreme Court said in Sanjeev that a law would get protection under Art. 31C if \"its object is to give effect to the Directive Principle,\" and that this connection must not be \"some remote or tenuous connection\". The Court refrained from using such terms as \"real and substantial\", \"dominant\", \"basically and essentially necessary\", or, \"closely and integrally connected\". The Court preferred to stick to the very words of Art. 31C without using any adjective. In Basantibai,88 the Bombay High Court applying the Minervatest concluded that the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Act, 1977, providing for acquiring land for a public purpose did not effectuate the policy underlying Art. 39(b). \"Remote and tenuous\" connection there might be but no \"real and substantial\" connection between the law and the Directive Principle. Further, the Court ruled that the provisions in the law regarding acquiring of the lands were \"merely subsidiary or incidental\" to the object of the Act, and were not \"essentially and integrally connected with the implementation of the directive principle\" and, as such, could not enjoy the protection of Art. 31C. But, on appeal, the Supreme Courtreversed the High Court and ruled that the Act gave effect to the objects contained in Art. 39(b). Acquisition of private land for providing housing sites to the community amounts to distribution of the material resources of the community, land being such a resource. Provision of public amenities, like markets, roads, etc. are all necessary for civic life and as these amenities are enjoyed by all, that is \"also a kind of distribution\". The impugned Act did not contain a declaration that it was being enacted to give effect to Art. 39(b). The question was whether the Act could claim the protection of Art. 31C in the absence of such a declaration. The Supreme Court answered in the affirmative. The Court observed:89 \" Art. 31C does not say that in an Act there should be a declaration by the appropriate legislature to the effect that it is being enacted to achieve the object contained in Art. 39(b). In order to ascertain whether it is protected by Art. 31C, the Page 114 Court has to satisfy itself about the character of the legislation by studying all parts of it. The question whether an Act is intended to secure the objects contained in Art. 39(b) or not does not depend upon the declaration by the legislature but depends on its contents.\" This proposition is now well-established that an express legislative declaration in the legislation is not a condition precedent to attract Art. 31C. The nexus between the impugned law and the objects of Art. 39(b) could be shown independently of any such declaration by the legislature. An express incantation in the law itself is not necessary to attract Art. 31C. The absence of evidence of nexus, in the form of an express declaration, was not by itself evidence of absence of such nexus.90 Article 31C is not confined in its scope only to the industrial sphere; it covers both the industrial as well as the agrarian spheres. The legislation relating to land reforms is a device to bring about radical alterations in property rights and economic obligations and aims at removal of concentration of wealth and distribution of means of production and material re-sources of the community--objectives contained in Arts. 39(b) and (c)--and, thus, such legislation is protected under Art. 31C.91 Accordingly, the Land Reforms Act effectuating the objectives of Art. 39(c) was held valid in Madhusudhan Singh v. Union of India, 92 as no ground of challenge survived because of Art. 31C. But other laws fulfilling Arts. 39(b) and 39(c) are also protected.",

Union of India, 92 as no ground of challenge survived because of Art. 31C. But other laws fulfilling Arts. 39(b) and 39(c) are also protected. Once a law fell within the protection of Art. 31C, application of Art. 31 was out. The purpose of Art. 31C was to exclude Art. 31 as it then stood. This means that the question whether the 'amount' offered for property acquired was \"illusory\" or not would not be open for the courts to probe into.93 Even if no amount is offered, the courts can do nothing. Appointment of a committee to enquire into the economics of the newspaper industry was held not protected by Art. 31C for its object was not to enquire into the ownership and control of the material resources of the community, nor did it relate to concentration of wealth etc., and so it was not relatable to the policy underlying Arts. 39(b) and (c).94 In Bhim Singhji v. Union of India, 95the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976, was held to be protected under Art. 31C. The purpose of the law is to inhibit concentration of urban lands in the hands of a few persons and to achieve equitable distribution of such land to subserve the common good. The Act is thus intended to achieve and implement the purposes of Arts. 39(b) and (c).96 But s. 27 thereof was held to be invalid as it imposed a restriction on the transfer of any urban, or urbanisable, land with a building or a portion of such building, which was within the ceiling area. The Judges, however, did not give any reasons for this ruling. In Minerva Mills, the Supreme Courtrefused to follow this ruling. The Court held that the Sick Textile Undertakings, (Nationalisation) Act, 1974, did fall within the purview of Art. 31C and, therefore, the Court refused to adjudicate upon the contention of the petitioners that some of the provisions of this Act were violative of Arts. 14 and 19.97 In Sanjeev Coke Mfg. Co. v. Bharat Coking Coal Ltd., 98 the Supreme Courtconsidered the question whether the Coking Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act, 1972, was entitled to the protection of Art. 31C. The Court ruled that the Act in question promoted the policy of Art. 39(b).1 Reference in Art. 39(b) to \"material resources\" of the community is not only to the resources owned by the community as a whole but also to resources owned by individual members of the community. \"Resources of the community do not mean public resources only but include private resources as well. The word \"distribute\" in Art. 39(b) has been used in a wider sense so as to take in all manner and method of distribution. It includes \"transformation of wealth from private ownership into public ownership and is not confined to that which is already public owned. The expression 'material resources of the community' is not confined to natural resources; it is not confined to resources, owned by the public; it means and includes all resources, natural and man-made, public and private owned.\" In Sanjeev, the Supreme Court has also rejected the argument that a discriminatory law could not be protected under Art. 31C. \"To make it a condition precedent that a law seeking the haven of Art. 31C must be non-discriminatory or based on reasonable classification is to make Art. 31C meaningless. If Art. 14 is not offended, no one need give any immunity from an attack based on Art. 14.\" Thus, \"where Art. 31C comes in Page 115 Art. 14 goes out.\" (d) NATIONALIZATION Nationalization laws have invariably been held to be valid under Art. 31C.2 The Supreme Court has ruled in a number of cases that nationalization laws give effect to the objectives of Art. 39(b).3 In State of Karnataka v. Ranganatha Reddy, 4 nationalization of transport was held to be a distributive process for the good of the community.5 The law was upheld without making any reference to Art. 31C. In State of Tamil Nadu v. L. Abu Kavur Bai, 6 a State law7 nationalising transport service was held valid as there was nexus between the Act and Arts. 39(b) and (c). The Court emphasized that in assessing nexus, \"a narrow approach\" ought not to be adopted. What is necessary is that there should be a reasonable connection between the Act and the object mentioned in Arts. 39(b) and (c). The Court said: \"The only question open to judicial review under the unamended Art. 31C was whether there is a direct and reasonable nexus between the impugned law and the provisions of Arts. 39(b) and (c). Reasonableness is regarding the nexus and not regarding the law.\"8 In Minerva Mills,9 it was held that as the Nationalization Act gave effect to the policy of the state underlying Arts. 39(b) and (c), it came under the protective umbrella of Art. 31C, and, therefore, the petitioners were not entitled to challenge the constitutional validity thereof on the ground of violation Arts. 14 and 19 of the Constitution. A declaration in the Act regarding the purpose mentioned in Arts. 39(b) and 39(c) may generally be evidence of nexus between the law and the objects of Arts. 39(b) and (c). If once the conditions mentioned in Art. 31C were fulfilled by law, no question of compensation would then arise as Art. 31 was expressly excluded. The question of compensation became totally irrelevant. The Court observed: \".... Art. 31C was not merely a pragmatic approach to socialism but imbibed a theoretical aspect by which all means of production, key industries, mines, minerals, public supplies, utilities and service may be taken gradually under public ownership, management and control.\" Similarly, when a law nationalising an undertaking is enacted and Art.",

    "content": "is attracted to protect such a law, then the Court cannot interfere even if no compensation is provided or what has been provided is illusory.10 Basing itself on various judicial statements made in Kesavananda Bharati by various Judges, the Court has now ruled in Tinsukha11 that \"whenever any immunity is claimed for a law under Art. 31C, the Court has the power to examine whether the provisions of law are basically and essentially necessary for the effectuation of the principles envisaged in Arts. 39(b) and (c).\" The legislative declaration of the nexus between the law and the principles in Art. 39 is inconclusive and is justiciable. That part of Art. 31C which sought to impart a constitutional sanctity, conclusiveness and non-justiciability to such legislative declarations was struck down in the Kesavananda case. The words \"material resources of the community\" found in Art. 39(b) comprise of electrical energy generated and distributed. An Act to nationalise an undertaking generating and distributing electricity is entitled to protection under Art. 31C as the object underlying the impugned legislation had \"a direct and reasonable nexus with the objective of distributing the material resources so as to subserve the common good.\" Under a law protected by Art. 31C, \"the adequacy, or justness or fairness of the compensation\" would not be justiciable. To the same effect is the pronouncement of the Supreme Court in Maharashtra State Electricity Board v. Thana Electric Supply Co .12In the instant case, the Act sought to buy out an electricity company. The Act Page 116 contained no declaration that it was enacted to give effect to the principles of State Policy in Arts. 39(b) & (c), yet the Court ruled, following Basantibai, that in spite of the absence of an express declaration in the law to the effect that the law had nexus with Art. 39(b), such a nexus could be established independently of any such declaration. \"The absence of evidence of nexus, in the form of an express declaration was not by itself evidence of absence of such nexus.\" The Court has to satisfy itself about the character of the law in question by studying all parts of it. A law having \"direct and substantial relationship with the objects of Art. 39(b)\" is entitled to the protection of Art. 31C. The law cannot then be challenged on the ground of violation of Arts. 14, 19 and 31.13 The Court has also ruled that the protection of Art. 31C is accorded only to those provisions which are basicallynecessary for giving effect to the objects of Art. 39(b). The proposition that the 'declaration' made in the law as envisaged in Art. 31C is not conclusive and that the Court can go behind the declaration and ascertain whether the law in question gives effect to the policy underlying the Directive Principles is illustrated by Lakshmanan.14 The Tamil Nadu Legislature enacted a law acquiring the Madras Race Club. The law contained a declaration that it was being enacted to give effect to the policy underlying Arts. 39(b) and (c). The Supreme Courtignored the declaration as the Act did not promote the policy underlying Arts. 39(b) and (c). The Court observed that there was no question whatsoever of the club owning or controlling the material resources of the community, or in any manner contributing towards the operation of the economic system resulting in the concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment. These was no question whatsoever of attracting the Directive Principles contained in Arts. 39(b) and (c). The Court found no nexus between the provisions of the impugned Act and the objects contained in Arts. 39(b) and (c). Art. 31-C having gone out, the Court assessed the validity of the impugned Act on the touch stone of Arts. 14 and 19. The Court found the Act to be hit by Art. 14. There was no reasonable basis for classifying the race-club for purposes of acquiring and transfer of its undertaking on the ground of mismanagement as the Companies Act had adequate provisions to deal with mismanagement of companies. The acquisition and transfer of the undertaking of the race club was held to be arbitrary and discriminatory and hence violative of Art. 14. In the case noted below15, a State Act totally banning slaughter of bulls and bullocks was challenged as imposing unreasonable restrictions under Art. 19(1)(g) read with Art. 19(6) insofar as it banned slaughter of these animals above the age of 16 years when they became useless as drought animals. The State justified the Act as being related to several Directive Principles, such as, Arts. 39(b), 39(c), 47 and 48 and, thus, claimed protection of Art. 31C. The Court ruled that the impugned Act had no nexus with any of these Directive Principles and refused the protection of Art. 31C.16The Court held the Act unconstitutional insofar as it banned slaughter of bulls above the age of 16 years.17 On the other hand, in the Rashtriya Mill Mazdoor Sangh v. State of Maharashtra, 18 the Court found a clear nexus between the impugned Act and Art. 39(b). The Act in question nationalised a spinning and weaving mills. The alternative to the nationalisation would be \"liquidation and unemployment of all the employees of the undertaking\". The Act ensured continuance of the undertaking as a productive unit and continuation in employment of all the employees. Therefore, the impugned Act undoubtedly was for effectuating the Directive Principles in Art. 39(b) towards securing that the ownership and control of the undertaking are so utilised as best to subserve the common good. The validity of the Act could not, therefore, be assessed under Arts. 14 and 19 because of the immunity conferred by Art. 31C. (e) A CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION A fine constitutional point has now been raised in Property Owners' Association v. State of Maharashtra .19 Art. 31C as originally enacted in 1972 by the 25th Constitutional Amendment gave primacy only to Arts. 39(b) and 39(c) over the Fundamental Rights in Arts.",

The validity of the Act could not, therefore, be assessed under Arts. 14 and 19 because of the immunity conferred by Art. 31C. (e) A CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION A fine constitutional point has now been raised in Property Owners' Association v. State of Maharashtra .19 Art. 31C as originally enacted in 1972 by the 25th Constitutional Amendment gave primacy only to Arts. 39(b) and 39(c) over the Fundamental Rights in Arts. 14 and 19 and, to this extent, Art. 31C was held constitutionally valid in Kesavananda. But, when in 1976, the scope of Art. 31C was expanded by the 42nd Amendment so as to give primacy to all Directive Principles over Art. 14 and 19, this Amendment to 31C was held to be invalid in Minerva Mills.20 The question is: When the amendment made to Art. 31C in 1976 was Page 117 invalidated, did Art. 31C revive in the form in which it was held valid in Kesavananda, or did it come to naught as a whole as a result of the pronouncement in the Minerva Mills?Till now, it has been assumed all along by the Supreme Court in a number of cases21 that Art. 31C stood revived in the form in which it was upheld as a result of the Kesavananda decision, after its amendment made in 1976 had been struck down in Minerva Mills. But in the Property Owners, it was argued that the doctrine of revival as it applies to ordinary statutes could not be applies to the constitutional amendment. This means that Art. 31C as it stood as a result of Kesavananda did not stand revived when the amendment made to it in 1976 was struck down in Minerva Mills. This argument would mean that Art. 31C does not survive at all in the Constitution and its benefit could not be available to exclude the attack to the validity of any statute on the ground of Arts. 14 and 19. In Property Owners, a bench of three Judges of the Supreme Court has thought it fit that this significant question ought to be considered and authoritatively decided by a larger bench of five or more Judges as this specific question has not arisen earlier in any case, and also because the decisions in Minerva, Waman Roa and Sanjeev were all by a Bench of five judges.22 So, the question whether Art. 31C exists in the Constitution or not, or whether it died with the Supreme Court decision in Minerva Mills, is going to considered by the Supreme Court in the near future. Accordingly, a Bench of five Judges sat to consider the issue, but the bench suggested that the matter be referred to a bench of seven Judges23 as one of the points which arose for consideration relates to the interpretation of Art. 39(b). The Bench of seven Judges met and referred the matter to a Bench of nine Judges.24 E. ARTICLE 300A The Forty-Fourth Amendment of the Constitution in 1978 transformed the right to property from the category of Fundamental Rights by repealing Art. 31, and converted it into an ordinary constitutional right by enacting Art. 300A instead. Art. 300A merely says: \"No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law\".25 Though Art. 300A is not a Fundamental Right, nevertheless, it does not make much of a difference except that a writ petition is not maintainable under Art. 32 in the Supreme Court to vindicate the right under Art. 300A. A person challenging violation of Art. 300A must go to a High Court under Art. 226 with his writ petition. The constitutional right to property under Art. 300A is not a basic feature or structure of the Constitution.26 After the Forty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution right to property is a human right and a constitutional right but not a Fundamental Right. The Court further held that control of property short of deprivation does not entail payment of compensation.27 Right to transfer land is incidental to right of ownership of the land and cannot be taken away without authority of law. Ownership of land jurisprudentially involves a bundle of rights. One of such rights is the right to transfer.28 An owner of a property, subject to reasonable restrictions which may be imposed by the legislature, is entitled to enjoy the property in any manner. The statutory interdict of use and enjoyment of the property must be strictly construed.29 The right to property is now considered to be not only a constitutional right but also a human right. The Declaration of Human and Civic Rights of 26-8-1789 enunciates under Article 17 :- \"Since the right to property is inviolable and sacred, no one may be deprived thereof, unless public necessity, legally ascertained, obviously requires it and just and prior indemnity has been paid\". Further under article 17 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948 dated 10-12-1948, adopted in the United Nations General Assembly Resolution it is stated that : (i) Everyone has the right to own property Page 118 alone as well as in association with others, (ii) No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property. Earlier human rights were more or less confined to the claim of individuals right to health, right to livelihood, right to shelter and employment, etc. but now human rights have started gaining a multifaceted approach. Now property rights are also incorporated within the definition of human rights. Even claim of adverse possession has to be read in consonance with human rights.30 Article 300A gets attracted to an acquisition or taking possession of private property, by necessary implication for public purpose, in accordance with the law made by Parliament or a State Legislature, a rule or a statutory order having force of law.",

    "content": "claim of adverse possession has to be read in consonance with human rights.30 Article 300A gets attracted to an acquisition or taking possession of private property, by necessary implication for public purpose, in accordance with the law made by Parliament or a State Legislature, a rule or a statutory order having force of law. It is inherent in very sovereign State by exercising its power of eminent domain to expropriate private property without owner's consent.31 Article 31(1) laid down that no person can be deprived of his property without the authority of law. Art. 31(1) has been repealed and Art. 31(1) re-appears as new Art. 300A saying that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law. Thus, a law will be necessary to deprive a person of his property. To ensure that a person is not deprived of his property without the authority of law, it does not matter whether it is a Fundamental Right or a constitutional guarantee, for in either case a law is needed to deprive a person of his property. In all democratic countries, one basic principle is recognised, viz., that the Government cannot interfere with property rights of an individual without the authority of a valid law. The most dramatic reiteration of this principle can be seen in the U.S.A. in Youngstown Steel and Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 32 where the U.S. Supreme Court held the seizure of steel mills by a presidential decree unconstitutional as there was no law to support it. Article 300A ensures that a person cannot be deprived of his property merely by an executive fiat. The rights in property can be curtailed, abridged or modified by the state only by exercising its legislative power. Deprivation of property can only be done according to law. Without law, there can be no deprivation of property. No law, no deprivation of property is the principle underlying Art. 300A. An executive order depriving a person of his property, without being backed by law, is not constitutionally valid.33 Article 300A only limits the powers of the State that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law. There has to be no deprivation without any sanction of law. Deprivation by any other mode is not acquisition or taking possession under Article 300A. In other words, if there is no law, there is no deprivation. Acquisition of mines, minerals and quarries is deprivation under Article 300A.34 Article 300A thus constitutes a protection against the executive organ of the state. Explaining the import of Art. 300A, the Supreme Court has observed in Bishamber Dayal Chandra Mohan v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 35 that the state cannot deprive a person of his property by taking recourse to executive power. A person can be deprived of his property \"only by authority of law and not by a mere executive fiat or order.\" In absence of any substantive provisions contained in a statute a person can not be restrained from dealing with his property in any manner he likes.36 Public interest has always been considered to be an essential ingredient of public purpose.37 In Wazir Chand v. State of Himachal Pradesh, 38 goods seized by the police from the appellant's possession without any authority of law were ordered to be restored to him. The Court pointed out that the state cannot interfere with the right of others unless it can point to some specific rule of law which authorises its actions. The Supreme Court admonished the State of Punjab in very strong terms in Bishan Das v. State of Punjab, 39 for illegally dispossessing the appellant of his property. The Court ruled that the State had no right to take the law into their own hands and evict a person by an executive order. Such an action is, 'destructive of the basic principle of the rule of law'. The Court observed: \"The action of the Government in taking law into their hands and dispossessing the petitioners by the display of force, exhibits a callous disregard of the normal requirement of the rule of law apart from what might legitimately and reasonably be expected from a government functioning in a society governed by a Constitution which guarantees to its Page 119 citizens against arbitrary invasion by the Executive of peaceful possession of property...We have here the highly discriminatory and autocratic act which deprives a person of the possession of property without reference to any law or legal authority.\" Recently, in the case noted below,40 the Supreme Court has again decried the action of the State Government in evicting some tenants from its property by force. The Court has ruled that \"possession can be resumed by the State Government only in a manner known to or recognised by law and it cannot resume possession otherwise than in due course of law.\" The Court has further asserted that in the absence of a specific statutory provision, a person cannot be evicted by the executive by force without following \"due course of law even on the ground of public interest.\" In a number of cases, a view has been taken that a government servant's right to pension is property and it cannot be reduced by the Government merely by an executive fiat without giving a hearing to the person affected. The courts thus apply the concept of natural justice in this area.41 Cash grants have also been regarded as property for this purpose.42 Cancellation of patta of land without giving a hearing to the patta-holder violates natural justice and is thus bad.43 The concept of property in Art. 300A is the same as was developed earlier under Art. 19(1)(f).44 Article 300A protects private property against executive action. But what about legislative action? As the wordings of Art. 300A correspond precisely with those of Art. 31(1), all the judicial pronouncements made under Art. 31(A) remain relevant to Art. 300A as well.",

As the wordings of Art. 300A correspond precisely with those of Art. 31(1), all the judicial pronouncements made under Art. 31(A) remain relevant to Art. 300A as well. Thus, when a demand for tax is made under a law which is not valid, it amounts to a threat to property without law and Art. 300A would become involved.45 Art. 300A may also become relevant under a taxing law in the Ujjambai situation which itself was a case under a taxation statute.46 Art. 300A is not violated when a tax is levied with retrospective effect.47 But what would be a public purpose in such a matter has been stated in Prakash Amichand Shah v. State of Gujarat .48 The Court said: \"In order to appreciate the contentions of the appellant it is necessary to look at the object of the legislation in question as a whole. The object of the Act is not just acquiring a bit of land here or a bit of land there for some public purpose. It consists of several activities which have as their ultimate object the orderly development of an urban area. It envisages the preparation of a development plan, allocation of land for various private and public uses, preparation of a town planning scheme and making provisions for future development of the area in question. The various aspects of a town planning scheme have already been set out,. On the final town planning scheme coming into force under Section 53 of the Actthere is an automatic vesting of all lands required by the local authority, unless otherwise provided, in the local authority. It is not a case where the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 have to be set in motion either by the collector or by the Government.\" The Court found that the impugned provision did not subserve such purpose. It is also not a case like State of Gujarat v. Shantilal Mangaldas49 that when a development is made, the owner of the property not only gets much more than what he would have got if the same remained undeveloped but also get the benefit of living in a developed town having good town planning. The courts should, therefore, strive to find a balance of the competing interests.50 The ostensible purpose of repealing Art. 31, especially Art. 31(2), is to free the legislature from the restraint of paying compensation for property acquired.51 But doubts have been raised whether this purpose can be achieved at all. For example, it has been argued that the two requirements of 'public purpose' and 'compensation' in case of acquisition of property are inherent and essential elements, or ingredients, or \"inseparable concomitants\" of the power of eminent domain52, and, therefore, of entry 42, List III, as well.53 But before invoking Art. 300A, title to the property concerned must be established. And not if the title itself is in dispute and is the subject matter of adjudication in proceedings legally constituted. It is only after title is established that the question whether rights in or to that property have been improperly or illegally infringed can arise.54 Page 120 The principle of trust has imposed restrictions on the power of the State in disposing of its property. In a situation where land has been acquired by the state for a public purpose, but it turns out later that the land is not required for such purpose, the state cannot dispose of it in any manner it likes by reason of the public trust doctrine which impresses upon the trust the obligation of giving back the property for anything less than the market value.55 At one time, such a view was endorsed by the Supreme Court.56 But later the two requirements came to be spelt out from Art. 31 and not from entry 42. In the future, law can take two courses depending on the judicial attitude: (i) either, the courts may focus on entry 42 and start reading the two requirements therefrom and, thus, hold a law of acquisition of property invalid if it does not fulfil these requirements; or, (ii) the courts may hold that in India, these requirements were read from Art. 31(2), and, after its repeal, these requirements cannot be spelt out from entry 42, and this may mean that the legislature will be under no restraints at all. In view of the development of property law in India up to 1979, the courts may not be willing to wipe out all that has happened so far and may re-interpret entry 42 so as to bring in the two elements therein. The view mentioned in (ii) above is supported by the Kerala High Court in its pronouncement in Elizabeth Samuel Aaron v. State of Kerala.57 The Court has said that the purpose of various amendments made in the Constitution will stand defeated if it is held that Art. 300A envisions payment of adequate compensation for the deprivation of property to the owner. What Parliament has done is only to transform Art. 31(1) into Art. 300A and omit Art. 31(2) in its entirety. Even if the first view is taken, it cannot cover the entire law of property. Quite a good deal of property law is enacted outside entry 42. Parliament may enact a law interfering with property rights under its residuary powers rather than under entry 42 and such a law will be free from the constraint of giving compensation as it may not amount to acquisition. The States may also enact law affecting property under their exclusive power over land (entry 18, List II).",

Such a law will be free from the constraint of compensation even if it interferes with property as it may not amount to acquisition of property.58 Then, it is not necessary that courts interpret compensation in the sense of Bella Banerjee, i.e., adequate compensation.59 The courts may take a flexible view on this point. Also, there is no reason to suppose that the courts will insist on payment of compensation in situations depicted by the old Art. 31(5) which incorporated, to some extent, the concept of police power.60 Arts. 31A, 31B and 31C are still there in the Constitution conferring immunity on certain types of property legislation from being challenged under Arts. 14, 19, or the entire Fundamental Rights.61 The word 'law' in Art. 300A means a valid law. Such a law will therefore be subject to other provisions of the Constitution, e.g., Arts. 14,62 19(1)(g)63 and 301.64 Ordinarily, the word 'law' in Art. 300A may mean a 'positive' or 'state-made law', e.g., a law made by Parliament or a State legislature, or a rule, or a statutory order, having the force of law.65 Can it be said, therefore, that the content of the law will be solely within the legislative discretion, and that the legislature can make any law it likes subject to Art. 14 and other constitutional provisions. This could be argued so long as the Gopalan66 view held the field. But since Maneka Gandhi,67 it is difficult to sustain this argument. It is quite plausible for the Court to assert that a law to be 'law' must not be unreasonable, arbitrary, oppressive or confiscatory; that the law should be fair and reasonable and that it should satisfy the principle of fairness in order to be effective. The Court can invoke the natural law theory to reach this result. In the alternative, because of the extended significance attached to Art. 14, viz., any unjust law denies equality, an unjust law may be vetoed by the Court.68 However, it should be underlined that Art. 21 does not apply to the property area.69 Nevertheless, the Court can interpret the word 'law' in Art. 300A in a meaningful sense, and not in the sense of merely any statutory law. For example, compulsory transfer of A's property by Page 121 law to B without any compensation may be held invalid as an unreasonable or arbitrary law. But this needs judicial creativity of a high order, such as that displayed by the Supreme Court in Maneka Gandhi. In Jilubhai,70 the Supreme Courthas stated that the word 'law' used in Art. 300A must be an Act of Parliament or of State Legislature, a rule or statutory order having the force of law. The deprivation of the property shall be only by authority of law, be it an Act of Parliament or State Legislature, but not by an executive fiat or order. Deprivation of property is by acquisition or requisition or taken possession of for a public purpose. The Court has also ruled that the law may fix an amount or which may be determined in accordance with such principles as may be laid therein and given in such manner as may be specified in such law. However, such law shall not be questioned on the ground that the amount so fixed or amount determined is not adequate. The amount fixed must not be illusory. The principles laid to determine the amount must be relevant to the determination of the amount.\" The Court has observed further:71 \"It would thus be clear that acquisition of the property by law laid in furtherance of the directive principles of State policy was to distribute the material resources of the community including acquisition and taking possession of private property for public purpose. It does not require payment of just compensation or indemnification to the owner of the property expropriated. It is the very negation of the effectuating the public purpose. Payment of market value in lieu of acquired property is not sine quanon for acquisition. Acquisition and payment of amount are part of the scheme and they cannot be dissected. However, fixation of the amount or specification of the principles and manner in which the amount is to be determined must be relevant to the fixation of amount. The amount determined need not bear reasonable relationship. In other words, it is not illusory. The adequacy of the resultant amount cannot be questioned in a Court of law. However, the validity of irrelevant principles are amenable to judicial scrutiny.\" This observation shows that acquisition of property by the state involves payment of some money in lieuthereof. When acquisition of property is linked with Art. 39(b) or 39(c), payment of an 'amount' is still necessary; it need not be adequate compensation but still it cannot be 'illusory'. Nothing has been said about acquisition of property unrelated to a Directive Principle. Payment of an amount is necessary in such a case as well, but, may be, the Court takes a more liberal view towards the deprived property owner while adjudging whether it is 'illusory' or not. Adequate compensation for property acquired seems to be a dead concept except under the Land Acquisition Act, or such other similar Acts. Without reference to any particular authority, the Supreme Court appears to have held that no person could be deprived of right to property without payment of any compensation.72 This observation of the Supreme Court is of considerable importance and seems to be in line with its earlier pronouncement in Jiubhai [ 1995 Supp (1) SCC 596].",

    "content": "now the Supreme Court appears to be proceeding on the assumption that there is a requirement of compensation and since copyright is akin to right to property and is subject to reasonable restrictions i.e. property can be acquired in public interest subject to payment of reasonable compensation.73 It is also interesting to note that the Supreme Court has used the word \"compensation\" and not amount i.e. in effect restoring the original provision of Article 31. In Basantibai v. State of Maharashtra, 74 the Bombay High Court did seek to interpret Art. 300A favourably to the property owners by reading therein the dual requirements of public policy and compensation as being inherent in the concept of eminent domain. Under Art. 300A, the legislature cannot sanction deprivation of property for a private purpose. The High Court said: \"The entire democratic structure of this country is based upon the concept of \"rule of law\" and it is not possible to imagine that the legislation can provide for compulsory acquisition of a private property for a purpose which is not a public purpose.\" The Court found it difficult to accept that by deletion of Art. 31, the Parliament intended to confer absolute right on the Legislature to deprive a citizen of his property by merely passing a law without complying with the requirement that the deprivation was for a public purpose and on payment of an amount which was not illusory. On this point, the Court observed: \"The doctrine of eminent domain really recognises the natural right of a person to hold property, and if that right can be taken away by the legislation without satisfying the two requirements, then the entire concept of rule of law would be redundant. The introduction of Art. 300A in the Constitution while deleting Art. 31 clearly indicates that the Parliament intended to confer a right on the citizen to hold property and which could not be deprived without authority of law. In our Page 122 judgment, in spite of deletion of Art. 31, the constitutional obligation to pay adequate amount to the expropriated owner is not taken away.\" In the third place, the provisions of the law providing for compensation were held to be discriminatory as it provided less for urban land and more for rural land which could not be substantiated on valid grounds. For acquisition of property in municipal limits, the impugned Act provided payment of an amount at 100 times the net average monthly income actually derived from urban property acquired; but for agricultural land acquired, the amount payable was to be determined as per the principles laid down in the land Acquisition Act, viz., the market price plus 15% solatium. This provision was held to be invalid under Art. 14 and so also under Art. 300A. The Court said that, really speaking, the value of land in the developed town within the municipal area could have no comparison to the value of the land in rural area and it was difficult to fathom why more compensation, including solatium, was provided for rural lands and the same was denied for urban lands which were of very high value. In the fourth place, and this was quite a remarkable assertion on the part of the High Court, even assuming that the law was protected from challenge under Arts. 14 and 19, because of Art. 31A, still the impugned provisions were bad as they were neither just nor fair nor reasonable and the deprivation of property under them was not by authority of law. After Maneka, the expression \"authority of law\" must mean \"just, fair and reasonable\" law. Procedure prescribed by law must be a fair and reasonable procedure independently of the protection guaranteed under Arts. 14 and 19. The legislation providing for deprivation of property under Art. 300A must be \"just, fair and reasonable\". The impugned provisions did not fulfil this requirement. The provisions providing for differential compensation for urban and rural lands were discriminatory. The favourable treatment shown to the owners of land in rural area was not shown to be justified for any reason whatsoever. The provision was invalid under Art. 300A. Even if protected from challenge under Arts. 14, 19 and 31 because of Art. 31C, it could still be struck down as being neither just nor fair nor reasonable. This pronouncement laid down several significant propositions. One, the dual requirements of public purpose and compensation inherent in the concept of eminent domain are to be read in Art. 300A itself. Two, instead of compensation, the Court has used several times the word 'amount' indicating that compensation payable for property acquired need not be an exact equivalent and may be less than that.75 There, Art. 300A envisages a \"just, fair and reasonable\" law and not any law. Four, even if a law is protected from challenge because of Art. 31C, it can still be invalidated because of its not being \"just, fair and reasonable\" because these qualities are derivable not only from Art. 14 but from Art. 300A itself because of the Maneka approach. This was the High Court's pronouncement. However, on appeal, the Supreme Courtreversed the High Court mainly on the ground that the Act in question was relatable to Art. 39(b) and so was protected under Art. 31C from being challenged under Art. 14. The Supreme Court has made an interesting comment on Art. 300A. Art. 300A is couched in the same language as Art. 31A(1). Assuming without deciding that the law should be \"fair and reasonable and not arbitrary,\" and that \"a law should also satisfy the principle of fairness in order to be effective,\" and that \"the said principle of fairness lies outside Art. 14,\" the Supreme Court held, nevertheless, that the law in question fulfilled all these conditions. \"Certain vacant lands lying outside a municipal area are being acquired for providing housing accommodation after paying an amount which is computed in accordance with a method considered to be a fair one by the courts.",

    "content": "the Supreme Court held, nevertheless, that the law in question fulfilled all these conditions. \"Certain vacant lands lying outside a municipal area are being acquired for providing housing accommodation after paying an amount which is computed in accordance with a method considered to be a fair one by the courts. The purpose for which the lands are acquired is a public purpose. The owners are given opportunity to make their representations before the notification is issued. All the requirements of a valid exercise of the power of eminent domain even in the sense in which it is understood in the United States of America where property rights are given greater protection than what is required to be done in our country are fulfilled by the Act\". The Court also ruled that Art. 21 has little to do with the right to own property as such. This is also not a case where deprivation of property would lead to deprivation of life, liberty or livelihood. Here land was being acquired to improve the living conditions of the people. To depend on Art. 21 to strike the Act in question would amount to a clear misapplication of the great doctrine enshrined in Art. 21. Some other judicial pronouncements on Art. 300A may be noted here. The State acquired land of the petitioner in 1977 under the Land Acquisition Act, but no compensation was paid to him for long. He filed a writ petition in the High Court under Art. 226 claiming compensation. The High Court held the writ petition Page 123 was maintainable because of Art. 300A. The Court stated that the Land Acquisition Act vests the state authorities to take over a person's property for public purpose, but with corresponding obligation to pay the compensationin lieuthereof. If compensation is not paid after acquisition and dispossession of land, the constitutional guarantee provided under Art. 300A of the Constitution will be violated. \"The right to acquire a person's property under the Land Acquisition Act is coupled with a duty to pay compensation and it is implied in the said duty that the said compensation payable should be paid as expeditiously as possible.\" If there is either failure to pay compensation, or if there is an abnormal delay in payment of compensation, there will be violation of the constitutional guarantee available under Art. 300A. In the following case,76 the State took possession of the land of the petitioner society for construction of a road but without acquiring it. The High Court characterised the action of the Government as \"high handed\" and observed: \"Howsoever laudable object the State may intend to achieve it can neither deprive a person of his property nor can it interfere with his right save by authority of law. Apart from violation of Art. 300A of the Constitution such an action of the State is also violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.\" The Court awarded Rs. 10,000/- as costs to the writ petitioner against the State and directed the State not to interfere with the possession of the petitioners over the land in dispute. In this connection, reference may be made to Yogendra Pal v. Municipality, Bhatinda, 77where a provision in the Punjab Municipal Act provided that while framing a town planning scheme, 25% of the land of any person would vest free of cost in the municipality. TheSupreme Court treated it as acquisition of land for public purpose without paying compensation and declared relevant statutory provision unconstitutional and violative of Art. 14. As right to money is property,78 therefore, non-payment of rent for long by a statutory body to the land owner has been held to be violative of Art. 300A. Art. 300A imposes a duty and obligation that no person can be deprived of his property save by authority of law. At the same time, Art. 300A creates a right in favour of a person that he should not be deprived of his property save by authority of law. Therefore, the corporation is under an obligation and duty not to deprive the petitioner of his property save by authority of law, otherwise, Art. 300A is violated.79 A lease executed between the State Government as a lessor and a company as lessee is not a mere contract but it constitutes a transfer of interest in land and creates a right in rem and the right of the lessee amounts to a right to property.80 This is thus protected under Art. 300A. Demolition of property and eviction of a lessee otherwise than in accordance with law is violative of Art. 300A. The lessee is not only entitled to be put back in possession in a writ petition but he can also sue for damages.81 The High Court emphasized:82 \"In the emerging rainbow of the constitutional law one thing is clear that no executive authority can interfere with the rights of liberty and property of any subject save and except on the basis of a legal provision authorising him to do so\". Right to recover the mortgage debts is also a right to enforce an interest in the property and therefore property within Art. 300A.83 The Fundamental Right to property has been the most controversial aspect of the Indian Constitution.84 It has caused friction and bad relationship between the Supreme Court and Parliament from time to time and has led to a number of constitutional amendments during the last 50 years.85 It has generated the largest number of Court cases in independent India. The de-escalation of this right in the constitutional scale of values commenced almost immediately after the commencement of the Constitution. In the process, Arts. 31A, 31B and 31C have been added to the Constitution to dilute the effect of some judicial pronouncements and to confer immunity on a broader range of legislation affecting property rights from being challenged under Fundamental Rights.",

In the process, Arts. 31A, 31B and 31C have been added to the Constitution to dilute the effect of some judicial pronouncements and to confer immunity on a broader range of legislation affecting property rights from being challenged under Fundamental Rights. It might have been better for the constitutional growth of the country if early in the day the right to property Page 124 had been abolished in a direct and straightforward manner by repealing Art. 31(2) which has been the main source of trouble.86 But, instead of that, constitutional amendments were passed adding exceptions upon exceptions on the Fundamental Right to property and even some novel techniques of constitutional amendment, like Arts. 31B and 31C, have been adopted causing a number of distortions in the Constitution. In the process, not only the right to property, but several other rights, like Arts. 14 and 19, have been adversely affected. The institution of judicial review has also been adversely affected. All this happened under the influence of the socialist doctrine. Before the 44th Amendment, only the husk of property right remained without much real content. Ultimately this right has been removed from the Chapter on Fundamental Rights. Time alone will show as to how the courts are going to interpret entry 42, list III, and Art. 300A. The crucial question however is that now that the concept of a socialist India is wearing thin, will the Supreme Court, in a creative bid, read in Art. 300A a right to compensation for acquisition/deprivation of private property. There is no gainsaying the fact that for growth of wealth and capital in the society, some protection to private property is absolutely essential. A strategy which the Supreme Court can adopt for this purpose may be to link Art. 300A with Art. 1487 and to interpret the word 'law' in Art. 300A in the same sense as 'law' in Art. 21.88 1.

A pre- Art. 31C Act, viz.the Tamil Nadu Slum Areas (Improvement & Clearance) Act, 1971 was held invalid under Art. 14 in so far as it provided for payment of compensation on a basis different from the Land Acquisition Act. The Court did not find the differential treatment under the Act as rational:V. Ponnusamy v. State of Tamil Nadu, AIR 1984 Mad 156.

    "content": "M P Jain Indian Constitutional Law/Volume 2/PART V POLITICAL AND CIVIL RIGHTS/CHAPTER XXXIII FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS (14) CHAPTER XXXIII Fundamental Rights (14) A. RIGHT TO CONSTITUTIONAL REMEDIES (a) ART. 32 Many of the principles relating to judicial review which are common to Art. 32 and Art. 226 will be found in the Page 131 text dealing with judicial review, and as such, may be read together. A right without a remedy does not have much substance. The Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution would have been worth nothing had the Constitution not provided an effective mechanism for their enforcement. According to Art. 13, Fundamental Rights are enforceable and any law inconsistent with a Fundamental Right is void.1 Art. 13 is the key provision as it makes Fundamental Rights justiciable. Art. 13 confers a power and imposes a duty and an obligation on the courts to declare a law void if it is inconsistent with a Fundamental Right. This is a power of great consequence for the courts. The Supreme Court has figuratively characterised this role of the judiciary as that of a \"sentinel on the qui vive\".2 Art. 32 confers power on the Supreme Court to enforce the Fundamental Rights. The High Courts also have a parallel power under Art. 226 to enforce the Fundamental Rights.3 Article 32(1) guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court, by appropriate proceedings, for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights enumerated in the Constitution. Art. 32(2) empowers the Supreme Court to issue appropriate orders or directions, or writs including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, and certiorari, whichever may be appropriate, for the enforcement of the petitioner's Fundamental Rights.4 Article 32(3) empowers Parliament by law to empower any other Court to exercise within the limits of its territorial jurisdiction all or any of the powers exercisable by the Supreme Court under Art. 32(2). This can however be done without prejudice to the Supreme Court's powers under Arts. 32(1) and (2). According to Art. 32(4), the right guaranteed by Art. 32 \"shall not be suspended except as otherwise provided for by the Constitution.\" As discussed later in this Chapter, Art. 359 provides, during an emergency, for the suspension of the right to move any Court for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights by a presidential order.5 Right of access to the Supreme Court under Art. 32 is a Fundamental Right itself.6 Art. 32(1) provides a very important safeguard for the protection of the Fundamental Rights of the citizens of India. Article 32 provides a guaranteed, quick and summary remedy for enforcing the Fundamental Rights because a person can go straight to the Supreme Court without having to undergo the dilatory process of proceeding from the lower to the higher Court as he has to do in other ordinary litigation. The Supreme Court has thus been constituted into the protector and guarantor of the Fundamental Rights. Commenting on the solemn role entrusted to itself by Art. 32, the Supreme Court has observed in Daryao v. State of Uttar Pradesh :7 \"The Fundamental Rights are intended not only to protect individual's rights but they are based on high public policy. Liberty of the individual and the protection of the Fundamental Rights are the very essence of the democratic way of life adopted by the Constitution, and it is the privilege and the duty of this Court to uphold those rights. This Court would naturally refuse to circumscribe them or to curtail them except as provided by the Constitution itself.\" The Court has emphasized in Romesh Thappar8 that \"this Court is thus constituted the protector and guarantor of the Fundamental Rights, and it cannot consistently with the responsibility so laid upon it, refuse to entertain applications seeking protection against infringement of such rights.\" Under Article 32, the Supreme Court enjoys a broad discretion in the matter of framing the writs to suit the exigencies of the particular case and it would not throw out the application of the petitioner simply on the ground that the proper writ or direction has not been prayed for.9 The Court's power is not confined to issuing writs only: it can make any order including even a declaratory order, or give any direction, as may appear to it to be necessary to give proper relief to the petitioner.10 Underlining the significance of Art. 32, the Supreme Court has characterised the jurisdiction conferred on it by Art. 32 as \"an important and integral part of the basic structure of the Constitution\"11 because it is Page 132 meaningless to confer Fundamental Rights without providing an effective remedy for their enforcement, if and when they are violated. \"A right without a remedy is a legal conundrum of a most grotesque kind.\" Art. 32 confers one of the 'highly cherished rights.'12 The purpose for which Art. 32 can be invoked is to enforce Fundamental Rights. Violation of a Fundamental Right is sine qua non of the exercise of the right conferred by Art. 32.13 The Supreme Court has described the significance of Art. 32 in the following words in Prem Chand Garg v. Excise Commissioner, U.P.,14 (Per Gajendragadkar, J.): \"The Fundamental Right to move this Court can therefore be appropriately described as the cornerstone of the democratic edifice raised by the Constitution. That is why it is natural that this Court should regard itself 'as the protector and guarantor of Fundamental Rights' and should declare that \"it cannot, consistently with the responsibility laid upon it, refuse to entertain applications seeking protection against infringements of such rights.... In discharging the duties assigned to it, this Court has to play the role of a 'sentinel on the qui vive' and it must always regard it as its solemn duty to protect the said Fundamental Rights 'zealously and vigilantly'.\"15 Through its many decision concerning Fundamental Rights under Art.",

    "content": "discharging the duties assigned to it, this Court has to play the role of a 'sentinel on the qui vive' and it must always regard it as its solemn duty to protect the said Fundamental Rights 'zealously and vigilantly'.\"15 Through its many decision concerning Fundamental Rights under Art. 32, the Supreme Court has given new dimensions, meaning and purpose to many Fundamental Rights, e.g., right to life.16 As well be seen in the next Chapter,17 the Supreme Court has raised many Directive Principles of State Policy from being mere platitudes to the high status of Fundamental Rights. (b) ART. 32 ENFORCES FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS As stated above, Art. 32 can be invoked only when there is an infringement of a Fundamental Right. The Supreme Court has laid emphasis on this aspect of Art. 32 as follows: \"It is well-settled that, the jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court under Art. 32 is an important and integral part of the Indian Constitution but violation of a Fundamental Right is the sine qua non for seeking enforcement of those rights by the Supreme Court. In order to establish the violation of a Fundamental Right, the Court has to consider the direct and inevitable consequences of the action which is sought to be remedied or the guarantee of which is sought to be enforced.\"18 In order to enforce a Fundamental Right, judicial review of administrative, legislative and governmental action or non-action is permissible. But, Art. 32 cannot be invoked simply to adjudge the validity of any legislation or an administrative action unless it adversely affects petitioner's Fundamental Rights.19 The Supreme Courtunder Art. 32(1) can, while considering a petition for the enforcement of a Fundamental Right, declare an Act to be ultra vires, or beyond the competence of the enacting legislature, if it adversely affects a Fundamental Right. Where an enactment, as soon as it comes into force, affects the Fundamental Rights of a person by its very terms, and without any further overt act being done, the person prejudicially affected is entitled immediately to invoke Art. 32, and get a declaration as to the invalidity of the impugned Act.20 Under Art. 32, the Court confines itself to the question of infringement of the Fundamental Rights and does not go into any other question.21 Thus, a petition against an illegal collection of tax is not maintainable under Article 32, for, the protection against imposition and collection of taxes except by authority of law comes from Art. 265 which is not a Fundamental Right.22 But if a tax levied without legal authority infringes a Fundamental Right, the remedy under Article 32 would be available.23 In Tata Iron and Steel Co. v. S.R. Sarkar, 24the company had paid tax under the Central Sales Tax Act to the State of Bihar, but the State of West Bengal also sought to levy a tax under the same Act on the same turnover. TheSupreme Courtentertained a petition under Article 32. Under the Act, there was a single liability to pay tax on inter-State sales. The company having paid the tax to Bihar, threat by Bengal to recover the tax in respect of the same sales infringed the Fundamental Right under Article 19(1)(g).25 Page 133 A final judgment of the Supreme Court cannot be assailed in an application under Art. 32 by an aggrieved person, whether he was a party to the case or not. The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Art. 32 cannot be invoked to challenge the validity of a final judgment/order passed by the Court.26 (c) ALTERNATIVE REMEDY Article 32 is in itself a Fundamental Right and, therefore, the existence of an alternative remedy is no bar to the Supreme Court entertaining a petition under Article 32 for the enforcement of a Fundamental Right. When once the Court is satisfied that the petitioner's Fundamental Right has been infringed, it is not only its right but also its duty to afford relief to the petitioner, and he need not establish either that he has no other adequate remedy, or that he has exhausted all remedies provided by law, but has not obtained proper redress. When the petitioner establishes infringement of his Fundamental Right, the Court has no discretion but to issue an appropriate writ in his favour.27 (d) ART. 32V. ART. 226 No action lies in the Supreme Court under Art. 32 unless there is an infringement of a Fundamental Right.28 As the Supreme Court has emphasized: \"The violation of a Fundamental Right is the sine qua non of the exercise of the right conferred by Art. 32.\"29 Article 32 differs from Art. 226 in that whereas Art. 32 can be invoked only for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights, Art. 226 can be invoked not only for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights but for 'any other purpose' as well.30 This means that the Supreme Court's power under Art. 32 is restricted as compared with the power of a High Court under Art. 226, for, if an administrative action does not affect a Fundamental Right, then it can be challenged only in the High Court under Art. 226, and not in the Supreme Court under Art. 32. The words \"for any other purpose\" found in Art. 226 (but not in Art. 32), enable a High Court to take cognizance of any matter even if no Fundamental Right is involved. It may, however, be pointed out that there have been a few exceptional cases where the Supreme Court has entertained writ petitions under Art. 32 although no question of Fundamental Right was involved. This approach of the Court is justifiable on the ground that in these cases questions of great constitutional significance were raised; there was no forum except the Supreme Court where these questions could be authoritatively decided, and there was no other mechanism, except Art. 32, to bring such matters within the cognisance of the Supreme Court.",

    "content": "to bring such matters within the cognisance of the Supreme Court. These matters inter alia are: (i) misuse of the ordinance-making power by the State of Bihar;31 (ii) appointment of the Judges of the High Courts and the Supreme Court;32 (iii) issues related with the procedure to remove a Supreme Court Judge.33 Reference may be made here to Tamil Nadu Couvery NVV NU P Sangam v. Union of India.34 The society moved a writ petition under Art. 32 in the Supreme Court for a direction to the Government of India to refer the cauvery water dispute to a tribunal. The petition remained pending in the Court for more than seven years. An objection was raised against the maintainability of the petition. Rejecting the objection, the Court ruled that to throw out the petition after seven years by accepting the objection against its maintainability \"would be ignoring the actual state of affairs, would be too technical an approach and in our view would be wholly unfair and unjust.\" (e) INTER-RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ARTICLES 32 AND 226 In the matter of enforcement of Fundamental Rights, the High Courts under Art. 226, and the Supreme Court under Art. 32, enjoy concurrent jurisdiction. A question has been raised whether a petitioner seeking to enforce his Fundamental Rights can go straight to the Supreme Court under Art. 32, or should he first go to a High Court under Art. 226. As early as 1950, in Page 134 Romesh Thappar,35 the Supreme Court ruled that such a petitioner can come straight to the Supreme Court without going to the High Court first. The Court stated that unlike Art. 226, Art. 32 confers a Fundamental Right on the individual and imposes an obligation on the Supreme Court which it must discharge when a person complains of infringement of a Fundamental Right. Art. 32 provides a guaranteed remedy for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights and constitutes the Supreme Court as the \"guarantor and protector of Fundamental Rights.\" This proposition has been reiterated by the Supreme Court in a number of cases.36 This continued to be the position till 1987 when a two-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court ruled in Kanubhai,37 that a petitioner complaining of infraction of his Fundamental Right should approach the High Court first rather than the Supreme Court in the first instance. the reason given for this view was that there was a huge backlog of cases pending before the Supreme Court. Since it is the view expressed by a two Judge Bench, it can not be regarded as an authoritative pronouncement on an important constitutional issue, viz., inter relationship between Arts. 32 and 226. Such a vital pronouncement could be made only by the Constitution Bench consisting at least of five Judges, especially, when the long established position is sought to be overturned. The ruling in Kanubhai seeks to negate what the Supreme Court has itself said in a number of cases during the last four decades emphasizing upon the significance of Art. 32, and the role assigned to it thereunder.38 Even otherwise, on merits, this view will make Art. 32 redundant for after having gone to the High Court first under Art. 226, the petitioner would then come to the Supreme Court by way of appeal and not under Art. 32, because of the principle of res judicata, discussed below. When a litigant approaches the Supreme Court, the matter is decided by the Court finally. But if he approaches the High Court, the petition is first decided by a single judge, an appeal then lies to the division bench, and, thereafter, an appeal may be taken to the Supreme Court. In fact, this may cause more delay and prove costlier to the petitioner than a writ petition directly under Art. 32. In effect, the Kanubhai ruling devalues the significance not only of the Fundamental Rights but of the Supreme Court itself. This could never have been the intention of the framers of the Constitution. In practice, it seems that the Kanubhai pronouncement has had no effect on the existing practice and the writ petitions continue to be filed in the Supreme Court under Art. 32 without first going to the High Court under Art. 226. Reference may also be made in this connection to the principle of Res Judicata discussed below.39 (f) BROAD CANVAS OF ART. 32 Article 32 being a Fundamental Right itself, it cannot be diluted or whittled down by any law. Art. 32 can be invoked even when a law declares a particular administrative action as final.40 The powers of the Supreme Court under Art. 32 are plenary and are not fettered by any legal constraints. If in exercise of these powers, the Court commits a mistake, the Court has plenary power to correct the mistake.41 That Art. 32 bestows the Supreme Court with great powers is illustrated by the following case. In Khatri v. State of Bihar,42several petitioners filed writ petitions under Art. 32 for enforcement of their Fundamental Right under Art. 21 on the allegation that they were blinded by the police while they were in its custody. The question arose whether the Court could order production of certain reports submitted by the CID to the State Government and some correspondence between the Government and certain officials. The Government claimed that this material was protected by Ss. 162 and 172 of the Cr.P.C. Rejecting the contention, the Court said that the proceedings under Art. 32 are neither an 'inquiry' nor a 'trial' for an offence. Neither theSupreme Courtis a criminal Court while hearing a writ petition nor are the petitioners accused persons and so these sections of the Cr.P.C. are not applicable to the Court's writ jurisdiction under Art. 32. (g) PROCEDURE UNDER ART. 32 Page 135 In Bandhua Mukti Morcha,43 the Apex Court has clarified that procedurally, under Art. 32, it is not bound to follow the ordinary adversary procedure and may adopt such procedure as may be effective for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights.",

    "content": "(g) PROCEDURE UNDER ART. 32 Page 135 In Bandhua Mukti Morcha,43 the Apex Court has clarified that procedurally, under Art. 32, it is not bound to follow the ordinary adversary procedure and may adopt such procedure as may be effective for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights. When a writ petition was moved on behalf of some workmen that they were being held in bondage, the Court appointed two persons as commissioners to make report on the petitioners' condition. It was argued that their report had no evidentiary value since what was stated therein was based only on ex parte evidence which had not been tested by cross-examination. The Court held the argument not well-founded and rejected it, as it was based upon a total misconception of the true nature of a proceeding under Art. 32. Article 32(1) does not say by what proceedings the Supreme Court may be moved for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights. The only limitation is that the proceedings must be 'appropriate' for the enforcement of a Fundamental Right. \"The Constitution-makers deliberately did not lay down any particular form of proceeding for enforcement of a Fundamental Right nor did they stipulate that such proceeding should conform to any rigid pattern or straight jacket formula,\"44 the reason being that they realised that the people were poor and illiterate and insistence on any rigid formula would be self-defeating. Article 32(2) confers power on the Court in its widest terms. \"It is not confined to issuing the high prerogative writs\", but \"it is much wider and includes within its matrix power to issue any directions, orders or writs which may be appropriate for enforcement of the Fundamental Right in question\".45 The Constitution is silent as to the procedure to be followed by the Court in exercising its power under Art. 32(2) because the Constitution-makers were anxious not to allow any procedural technicalities to stand in the way of enforcement of Fundamental Rights and they never intended to fetter the Court's discretion to evolve a procedure appropriate in the circumstances of a given case to enable it to exercise its power to enforce a Fundamental Right. Whatever procedure is necessary to fulfil that purpose is permissible to the Court. It is not at all obligatory for the Court to follow adversarial procedure. No such restriction ought to be imposed on the Court. In such a system a poor person is always at a disadvantage against a rich person. When the poor come to the Court for enforcement of their Fundamental Rights, it is necessary to depart from the adversarial procedure and evolve a new procedure so as to enable such people to bring the necessary material before the Court so as to secure enforcement of their rights. In the words of Bhagwati, J.:46 \"We have therefore to abandon the laissez faire approach in the judicial process particularly where it involves a question of enforcement of Fundamental Rights and forge new tools, devise new methods and adopt new strategies for purpose of making Fundamental Rights meaningful for the large masses of people. ... If we want the Fundamental Rights to become a living reality and the Supreme Court to become a real sentinel on the qui vive, we must free ourselves from the shackles of outdated and outmoded assumptions and bring to bear on the subject fresh outlook and original unconventional thinking.\" Accordingly, the Court has accepted even a letter addressed to the Court as an \"appropriate\" proceeding and has taken congnizance of the matter raised therein. The letter need not be in any particular form.47 The poor cannot produce relevant material before the Court in support of their case. Even when a case is brought on their behalf by a citizen actingpro bono publico, it would be almost impossible for him to gather the relevant material and place it before the Court. If the Court adopts a passive attitude and declines to intervene in the absence of relevant materials, \"the Fundamental Rights would remain merely a teasing illusion so far as the poor and disadvantaged sections of the community are concerned.\"48 That is why the Court appoints commissioners to gather facts and data in regard to a complaint of breach of a Fundamental Right made on behalf of the weaker sections of the society. The commissioners' report furnishes prima facie evidence of the facts and data. The Court appoints as commissioners such persons as would carry out the assignment objectively and impartially without any predilection or prejudice. Any party can dispute the facts or data stated in the commissioners' report. It is entirely for the Court to consider what weight ought to be attached to the facts mentioned in the report. The High Courts can also follow a similar procedure in exercise of their jurisdiction under Art. 226. Page 136 (h) ART. 32 CANNOT BE RESTRICTED BY LEGISLATION Article 32 being a Fundamental Right cannot be diluted by any legislation. Section 14 of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950, prevented the detenu, on pain of prosecution, from disclosing to any Court the grounds of his detention communicated to him by the detaining authority. The provision was held unconstitutional as it rendered nugatory the exercise of the Supreme Court's power under Art. 32 for unless the Court could examine the grounds on which the detention order had been based, it could not decide whether detenu's Fundamental Right under Arts. 21 and 22 had been infringed or not.49 A similar point was raised in Express Newspapers v. Union of India in another way.50The Working Journalists Act, 1955, constituted a wage board for fixing the rates of wages of working journalists. The Act was challenged on the ground that it made no provision requiring the wage board to give reasons for its decision. It was argued that this rendered the petitioner's right to approach the Supreme Courtfor enforcement of his Fundamental Rights nugatory because, in the absence of reasons, the Court would not be able to investigate the validity of the order.",

    "content": "Act was challenged on the ground that it made no provision requiring the wage board to give reasons for its decision. It was argued that this rendered the petitioner's right to approach the Supreme Courtfor enforcement of his Fundamental Rights nugatory because, in the absence of reasons, the Court would not be able to investigate the validity of the order. The Court rejected the argument saying that the Act would have been invalid had it prohibited the wage board from giving reasons for its decision, as that would have rendered Art. 32 nugatory. But as there was no such provision and it was left to the board's discretion to give reasons for its decision or not, Art. 32 was not infringed in any manner whatsoever. In Prem Chand v. Excise Commr., 51 the Supreme Court struck down one of its own rules (O. 35, R. 12) which required furnishing of security to move the Court under Art. 32, as it retarded the assertion or vindication of the Fundamental Right under Art. 32. The rule imposed a financial obligation on the petitioner, and if he did not comply with it, his petition would fail. The Court also took the position in Prem Chand that furnishing of security discriminated against the poor sections of the society, and that Art. 32 cannot be encumbered by rules, which favoured the rich with access to justice. But a rule aiding and facilitating the orderly presentation of petitions under Art. 32 cannot be regarded as unconstitutional as contravening Art. 32. A rule requiring security for filing a petition for review of an order made earlier by the Court dismissing an Art. 32 petition is valid as it does not restrict Art. 32 in any way.52 The Supreme Court has again asserted recently that its power and jurisdiction under Art. 32 cannot be curtailed by any law. In exercising its power under Art. 32, the Court can direct any body to make any inquiry. All authorities in the country are bound by the directions of the Court and have to act in aid of the Court. In Paramjit,53 the Supreme Courtdirected the National Human Rights Commission to make an inquiry into a specific matter. Under the Act establishing the Commission, it cannot inquire into any matter which is more than one year old. But the Supreme Court ruled that the Commission could inquire into the referred matter even though it was older than one year because the Commission would be functioning sui generis under the direction issued by the Court under Art. 32 and not under its own constituent statute. By and large the Supreme Court has used its jurisdiction under Art. 32 in a creative manner. In case after case coming before it under Art. 32, the Court has given new dimensions, meaning and scope and purpose to many Fundamental Rights, such as, right to equality, freedom of speech, right to personal liberty and life.54 This point will be appreciated much more when reference is made to the discussion under 'Public Interest Litigation'.55 (i)RES JUDICATA The Supreme Court has imposed a significant restriction on the invocation of its jurisdiction under Art. 32 by applying the doctrine of res judicata.56 The rule of res judicata is based on considerations of public policy as it is in the larger interest of the society that a finality should attach to binding decisions of courts of competent jurisdiction, and that individuals should not be made to face the same kind of litigation twice. If the doctrine of res judicata were not applied to writ proceedings, then a party could take one proceeding after another and urge new grounds every time in respect of one and the same cause of action. This would plainly be inconsistent with considerations of public policy. Accordingly, a person cannot move successive Page 137 petitions under Art. 32 for the same cause of action. An order assessing the tax having been challenged once through a writ petition, it cannot be challenged again through another writ petition even if the petitioner seeks to urge new grounds against the order.57 When once the Supreme Court has decided a question between two parties under Art. 32, the same question cannot be reopened between the same parties under Art. 32.58 The petitioner challenged his detention in a writ petition, but it was dismissed. Subsequently, after renewal of the detention order, he sought to file another petition repeating some of the contentions which he had advanced earlier. The Court rejected the petition as no new grounds had arisen to challenge detention again.59 But res judicata would not apply if orders sought to be challenged through successive writ petitions are different, as for example, when a petition challenging the validity of the tax assessment for one year is dismissed by the Supreme Court, a similar order passed for the subsequent year can be challenged through a new writ petition on some new grounds not raised earlier in the first writ petition.60 The Supreme Court has ruled in Lallubhai v. Union of India61 that the doctrine of constructive res judicata is applied only to civil actions and civil proceedings. This principle of public policy is entirely inapplicable to illegal detention and does not bar a subsequent petition for a writ of habeas corpus under Art. 32 on fresh grounds not taken in the earlier petition for the same relief. Thus, when a writ petition challenging an order of detention is dismissed by the Court, a second petition can be filed on fresh, additional grounds to challenge the legality of the continued detention of the detenu, and the subsequent petition is not barred by res judicata. When a writ petition under Art. 226 has been dismissed by the High Court, another writ petition under Art. 32 cannot be moved in the Supreme Court, to seek redress in the same matter.",

    "content": "a writ petition under Art. 226 has been dismissed by the High Court, another writ petition under Art. 32 cannot be moved in the Supreme Court, to seek redress in the same matter. The principle of res judicata envisages that if a judgment has been pronounced by a Court of competent jurisdiction, it is binding between the parties unless it is reversed or modified in appeal, revision or other procedure prescribed by law. According to the Supreme Court, the jurisdiction of a High Court in dealing with a writ petition under Art. 226 is substantially the same as that of the Supreme Court under Art. 32. The scope of the writs under both the Articles being concurrent, res judicata applies. The High Court's decision can be attacked in an appeal to the Supreme Court but not through a writ petition.62 In Daryao,63 the Supreme Court dismissed a writ petition moved under Art. 32 because earlier the petitioner had moved in the High Court a writ petition under Art. 226 on the same facts and the High Court had rejected the same. In Har Swarup,64 the petitioner filed a writ petition under Art. 226. The High Court dismissed the petition and also refused leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. Thereafter, he filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court under Art. 32 claiming exactly the same reliefs as he had claimed in the High Court and on identical grounds. In the circumstances, the Supreme Court dismissed the writ petition on the basis of the principle of res judicata. The res judicata principle would, however, apply only when the High Court has disposed of the writ petition on merits. If the petition has been dismissed by the High Court not on merits, but on a technical ground, e.g., petitioner's laches, or that he has an efficacious alternative remedy available to him, or the petition has been dismissed in limine without passing a speaking order, then res judicata would not apply and the Supreme Court can entertain a petition under Art. 32, because Art. 32 is a Fundamental Right and the Supreme Court ordinarily issues a writ if there is a breach of any Fundamental Right.65 The principle of res judicata has also been applied when a person first goes to the Supreme Court under Art. 32, and on his application having been rejected there, comes to the High Court under Art. 226.66Res judicata is not applied to a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. If such a petition is dismissed by the High Court on merits, a similar petition may be entertained by the Supreme Court under Art. 32.67 Article 32 is not available to assail the correctness of a decision rendered by the Supreme Court on merits or to claim its reconsideration by the Court.68 The Supreme Court rendered a decision. The Court also dismissed a review petition seeking a review of the Page 138 decision. Thereafter, a writ petition was filed under Art. 32 challenging the validity of the Court decision. The Court referred the question for decision to the Constitution Bench whether a Court decision can be challenged through a writ petition. The Court has now decided that this cannot be done.69 (j) QUASI-JUDICIAL BODIES The Supreme Court has diluted the efficacy of Art. 32 as a technique to challenge a decision by a quasi-judicial body.70 In Ujjam Bai v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 71 the Court has held that an assessment of sales tax by a quasi-judicial authority, acting within its jurisdiction and under an intra vires law, could not be challenged under Art. 32 on the ground that it has misconstrued or misinterpreted the law, because no breach of any Fundamental Right was involved in such a situation. Such an error can be corrected by way of appeal to the Supreme Court. Article 32 is, however, available when a Fundamental Right is violated-- (1) by a quasi-judicial authority acting under an ultra vires law; or (2) when the assessing authority seeks to impose a tax against a constitutional prohibition;72 or demands to tax not leviable under any valid law; or (3) where the statute is intra vires but the authority acts under it without jurisdiction, or wrongly assumes jurisdiction:73 or (4) where the action taken is procedurally ultra vires, for example, when principles of natural justice are infringed.74 The Government of India, by a statutory order, applied the Sea Customs and other relevant Acts to Pondicherry, saving \"all things done or omitted to be done before November 1, 1954\" from the mischief of the Acts being applied. The petitioner had placed orders for imports before, but received the consignments after, the said date, and the Customs Collector seized them and imposed a heavy penalty on him. The petitioner challenged the Collector's order under Art. 32 alleging infringement of Art. 19(1)(g) on the ground that the Collector was acting without jurisdiction. Rejecting the petition, the Supreme Court held by a majority that in seizing the consignments, the Collector was acting within jurisdiction and was discharging a quasi-judicial function. Although he might either be taking a wrong view of the facts, or misconstruing the statutory order in question, yet in none of these situations could the Court interfere under Art. 32, in the latter event because of the ruling in the Ujjambai case.75 In STC v. Mysore, 76 the Ujjambai case was held inapplicable and an assessment of sales tax on inter-State sale of cement was quashed under Art. 32. Under the Constitution, a State cannot tax an interstate sale. It was argued that the taxing officer was acting in a quasi-judicial capacity; he had jurisdiction to decide whether a particular sale was inter-State or not, and any error committed by him in deciding that question falling within his jurisdiction would not offend any Fundamental Right as had been held in the Ujjambai case.",

    "content": "was argued that the taxing officer was acting in a quasi-judicial capacity; he had jurisdiction to decide whether a particular sale was inter-State or not, and any error committed by him in deciding that question falling within his jurisdiction would not offend any Fundamental Right as had been held in the Ujjambai case. The Court, however, held that the taxing officer had no jurisdiction to tax inter-State sales because of the constitutional prohibition,77 and he could not give himself a jurisdiction to tax such a sale by deciding a collateral fact wrongly. The Supreme Court has explained in Coffee Board,78 that a petitioner has a right to move a writ petition under Art. 32 to challenge a quasi-judicial decision where the action is proposed to be taken under an ultra vires statute, or where the action is taken without jurisdiction, or without following natural justice. Errors of law or fact committed in exercise of the jurisdiction under a valid law are not usually corrected through writ petitions under Art. 32. The proper way to correct them is to proceed under the provisions for appeal, or by way of writ petitions under Art. 226. If a quasi-judicial authority acts without jurisdiction, or wrongly assumes jurisdiction by committing an error as to collateral fact and the resultant action threatens or violates a Fundamental Right, the question of enforcement of that right arises and a petition under Art. 32 will lie. \"If, however, a statute is intra vires but the action taken is without jurisdiction then a petition under Art. 32 would be competent\". A writ petition was moved in the Supreme Court under Art. 32 on the ground that the licensing authority Page 139 misapplied the Imports and Exports Control Act. The Court dismissed the same on the ground that a petition under Art. 32 is not competent to challenge any erroneous decision of an authority. Invoking the authority of Ujjambai, the Court ruled that a wrong application of the law would not amount to a violation of Fundamental Rights. If the provisions of the law are valid, and the orders passed are within the jurisdiction of the authority concerned, there is no infraction of any Fundamental Rights whether the authority was right or wrong on facts. An erroneous decision does not violate Fundamental Rights.79 The above-mentioned cases bring out the difficulties of challenging quasi-judicial decisions on the ground of infringement of Fundamental Rights through Art. 32 petitions. The law has become rather technical. It is always a difficult question to decide whether an authority is acting without jurisdiction, or within jurisdiction but taking a wrong view of facts or law. Art. 32 is available in the first case but not in the second. Similarly, if a quasi-judicial authority acting within jurisdiction, misinterprets a constitutional provision, rather than an ordinary law, Art. 32 may be available. On the whole, therefore, it is a hazardous task to challenge a quasi-judicial decision under Article 32. The effect of this is to encourage people to take recourse to the High Courts under Article 226 which is broader in scope than Article 32. This position, in a way, appears to be anomalous for, while Article 32 is a guaranteed right, Article 226 is not so. At times, to apply the above propositions, the Supreme Court may have to go into the question whether the authority whose decision is being questioned in an Art. 32 petition exercises an 'administrative' or a 'quasi-judicial' function.80 Such a question arose in Gulam Abbas v. State of Uttar Pradesh .81The question was: whether an order passed under S. 144 , Cr.P.C., is a 'judicial' or 'quasi-judicial' order or one passed in the exercise of an 'executive power'? The question arose as such an order was sought to be challenged before the Supreme Court through an Art. 32 petition. The Court characterised such an order as an executive order arguing as follows: Under the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, there is a separation of judicial functions from the executive functions of the magistrates. By and large, judicial functions have been allocated to judicial magistrates and executive or administrative functions to the executive magistrates. S. 144 , Cr.P.C., deals with urgent cases of nuisance and apprehended danger to public tranquillity and the power underS. 144 has been conferred on an executive magistrate. Therefore, an order passed under S. 144 cannot be regarded as a judicial or quasi-judicial order. The function under S. 144 is essentially an executive (police) function. It is true that before passing an order, the magistrate gives a hearing to the parties except in an emergency when an ex parte order can be made without notice to the person against whom it is directed; also, an order under S. 144, though made by an executive magistrate, is revisable by the High Court. But these aspects do not make such an order quasi-judicial. Hearing merely ensures fairness and fairplay and the observance of the audi alteram partem rule which is essential to the performance of any executive or administrative function. Revision of the order by the Court only removes the vice of arbitrariness, if any. The order under s. 144 is an executive order passed in the performance of an executive function where \"no lis as to any rights between rival parties is adjudicated but merely an order for preserving public peace is made\" and, as such, it is amenable to writ jurisdiction under Art. 32. (k) QUESTIONS OF FACT The Court has power to decide disputed questions of fact arising in a writ petition if it so desires. This was very clearly stated by the Court in Kochunni,82 where the Court observed: \"But we do not countenance the proposition that, on an application under Art. 32, this Court may decline to entertain the same on the simple ground that it involves the determination of disputed questions of fact or on any other ground.",

If we were to accede to the aforesaid contention of learned counsel, we would be failing in our duty as the custodian and protector of the Fundamental Rights... Further, questions of fact can and very often are dealt with on affidavits.\" This statement was made in 1959. Since then the attitude of the Court has stiffened on this question and, ordinarily, the Court does not now go into disputed questions of fact83 in a writ petition. The reason for this judicial stance is that disputed questions of fact can be decided properly by examining the pleadings raised by the parties and by taking evidence and such a course is not possible in a summary proceeding like that of Page 140 a writ petition under Art. 32. The Court has observed in this connection:84 \"We must make it clear that in a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution, it is not our province to go into facts.\" The Court may, however, make an exception in this regard in any specific case.85 (l) LACHES Laches or inordinate delay on the part of the petitioner may disentitle him to move a writ petition under Art. 32 to enforce his Fundamental Right.86 The Court refuses relief to the petitioner on the ground of laches because of several considerations, e.g., it is not desirable to allow stale claims to be canvassed before the Court; that there should be finality to litigation; that rights which have accrued to others by reason of the delay in filing the petition should not be disturbed unless there is reasonable explanation for the delay. The aggrieved party should, therefore, file the petition at the earliest possible time. In Trilokchand Motichand v. H.B. Munshi, 87 the sales tax officer sought to collect tax from petitioner Trilokchand. He filed a writ petition in the High Court which failed. Thereupon, in 1959, he agreed to pay the tax in instalments. In 1967, on some proceedings initiated by some other party, the Supreme Court struck down the relevant provision in the law as infringing Art. 19(1)(f) of the Constitution.88 Thereafter, in 1968, Trilokchand moved the Supreme Court under Art. 32 praying that the order seeking to recover tax from him be quashed as it had been issued under an unconstitutional statute. The Supreme Courtrejected the petition by a majority on the ground of laches. Some of the Judges suggested that the Indian Limitation Act may be applied by analogy to petitions under Art. 32. This meant that a claim based on infraction of a Fundamental Right ought not to be entertained if made beyond the period fixed by the Limitation Act for the enforcement of the right by way of a suit. A middle view was expressed by Hidayatullah, C.J. He denied that the Limitation Act would apply to writ petitions under Art. 32, but still he maintained that the petitioner should move the Court at the earliest and should explain satisfactorily if there is delay on his part. There is no fixed period for the purpose and the Court decides each case on its merits. He gave the reason for rejecting delayed writ petitions as follows: \"The action of courts cannot harm innocent parties if their rights emerge by reason of delay on the part of the person moving the Court.\" The Chief Justice therefore opined: \"Therefore the question [of delay] is one of discretion for this Court from case to case. There is no lower limit and there is no upper limit.... It will all depend on what the breach of the Fundamental Right and the remedy claimed are and how the delay arose\". However, Justice Hegde, dissenting, took an absolutist view on the question of laches. He asserted that \"Laches on the part of an aggrieved party cannot deprive him of the right to get relief from the Court under Art. 32.\" He asserted that the Limitation Act has no relevance either directly or indirectly under Art. 32. The right under Art. 32 itself being a Fundamental Right, it could not be curtailed or circumscribed except as provided by the Constitution. If the Court regards its power under Art. 32 as discretionary then Art. 32 would cease to be a Fundamental Right. While there may be justification for the rule that very stale claims should not be permitted to be agitated through writ petitions under Art. 32, the rule suggested in the Trilokchandcase that the measure of delay should be the period of limitation fixed by the Limitation Act for a suit on similar fact-situation, would have been too rigid and unsupportable. Art. 32 is a Fundamental Right itself and its efficacy should not be unduly curtailed. The situation was, however, retrieved by the Supreme Court's decision in R.S. Deodhar v. State of Maharashtra .89There was a delay of more than 10 years in filing the writ petition since the accrual of the cause of complaint. The Court rejected the contention that the petition was delayed. On the rule of laches, the Court observed that this \"is not a rule of law, but a rule of practice based on sound and proper exercise of discretion, and there is no inviolable rule that whenever there is delay, the Court must necessarily refuse to entertain the petition. Each case must depend on its own facts\". The period of limitation prescribed in the Limitation Act should be used as a guide and not as an absolute rule.",

    "content": "case must depend on its own facts\". The period of limitation prescribed in the Limitation Act should be used as a guide and not as an absolute rule. Further, the Court asserted that \"this Court which has been assigned the role of a sentinel onqui vive for the protection of the Fundamental Rights Page 141 cannot easily allow itself to be persuaded to refuse relief on the jejune ground of laches, delay or the like\". The above discussion means that the Court will consider each case on its facts and decide whether or not the petition should be rejected on the ground of laches. There is no fixed period of limitation applicable to Art. 32 petitions.90 This in a way is acceptance of the view expressed by Hidayatullah, J., in Trilokchand. The Supreme Court thus applies the rule of laches in a flexible and not a rigid manner. The Supreme Court may consider a delayed petition if the petitioner is able to give a reasonable explanation for the delay. In Rabindra Nath v. Union of India, 91 the Court rejected a writ petition filed to challenge the seniority rule made fifteen years earlier under Arts. 14 and 16. The Court said in R.S. Makashi v. I.M. Menon, 92 that no relief could be given to the petitioner who, without any reasonable explanation, approaches this Court under Art. 32 after inordinate delay. \"It would be unjust to deprive the respondents of the rights which have accrued to them.\" In this case, vested rights were sought to be disrupted after eight years. In Roshanlal,1 the Supreme Court rejected a writ petition presented in 1978 challenging certain appointments made in 1975. The Court thought that it would not be justified in re-opening the question of the legality of the appointments after several years. In Doval,2 a provisional seniority list prepared in March, 1971, was challenged in 1983 through a writ petition filed under Art. 32. Many promotions had been made during the intervening period. The Supreme Court refused to dismiss on the ground of laches arguing that the impugned list was merely provisional and that the Government neither considered nor replied to the many representations made by the petitioners. Also, the petitioners belonging to the lower echelons of service might have found it difficult to move the Court earlier. In S.S. Moghe v. Union of India, 3 promotions in government service were challenged on the ground of infringement of Fundamental Right. No explanation was given for delay of several years in filing the writ petition. Rejecting the petition, the Court said that a party should be diligent in enforcing his Fundamental Right and he should approach the Court within a reasonable time after the cause of action had arisen. If there has been undue delay or laches on his part, the Court has discretion to deny him relief. A writ petition filed in 1973 sought to set aside a number of promotions and confirmations which had taken place long before the filing of the petition. The Court dismissed the petition on the ground that \"the equitable rights of a number of other government servants had come into existence by the laches and acquiescence of the petitioners.\"4 When the writ jurisdiction was invoked within two months of the impugned admission to an institute, the Court held the time-gap to be reasonable.5 In the case mentioned below,6 the Supreme Court allowed a writ petition in 1973 directing the government to implement the report of the Pay Commission presented in 1959 in respect of the petitioners. (m) AGAINST WHOM A WRIT CAN BE ISSUED? By and large Fundamental Rights are enforceable against the state. The term 'state' has been defined in Art. 12 which has already been discussed earlier.7 There are a few Fundamental Rights, such as, under Arts. 17, 21 23 or 248 which are also available against private persons. In case of violation of any such right, the Court can make appropriate orders against violation of such rights by private persons.9 (n) WHO CAN APPLY? Article 32 does not prescribe the persons or classes of persons who can invoke the Supreme Court's jurisdiction for the redressal of their grievances. The matter of 'standing' thus lies within the realm of the Page 142 Supreme Court. The general principle is that a person whose Fundamental Right has been infringed has locus standi to move the Supreme Court under Art. 32 for the enforcement of his right.10 A person whose Fundamental Right is affected has standing to file a petition under Art. 32. The legal right to be enforced under Art. 32 must ordinarily be the right of the petitioner himself. As rights are different and inhere in different legal entities, it is not competent to a person to seek to enforce the rights of another except when the law permits him to do so.11 This principle emanates from the theory that the remedies and rights are correlative and, therefore, only a person whose own right is in jeopardy is entitled to seek a remedy. Since a corporation has a distinct legal personality of its own, with rights and duties separate from those of its individual members, a shareholder cannot complain against a law which affects the Fundamental Right of the corporation except to the extent that it infringes his own Fundamental Right as well.12 A well-known exception to this principle, however, is a petition for a writ of habeas corpus which can be made not only by the person who is imprisoned or detained but by any person, provided he is not a complete stranger, for liberating a person from an illegal imprisonment.13 The rule of standing is also relaxed in case of a petition for quo warranto.14 The principle applicable to civil suits that all parties interested in the subject-matter of the suit should be made parties, is not applicable to the petitions under Art. 32.",

    "content": "If a petitioner has a right to maintain the petition, his petition would not be thrown out and relief refused to him by way of enforcing his Fundamental Right merely because he has not made another person, having equal right with him to maintain the petition, a party thereto.15 Over a period of time, the Supreme Court has been taking a liberal view of locus standi. Art. 32 confers a good deal of freedom on the Supreme Court to evolve its own rules of locus standi. The Court realises that if a narrow view of locus standi is taken, and if the categories of persons who can challenge governmental action are confined within narrow limits, then the danger is that many governmental actions may go unchallenged as there may be none entitled to challenge such action. The movement towards broader standing to invoke judicial review is justified by the argument that the great expansion in the power of the bureaucracy has increased the need for judicial supervision which involves lowering of barriers in the way of invoking judicial review.16 Thus, in A.B.S.K. Sangh (Rly.) v. Union of India, 17 the Supreme Court overruled the objection that an unrecognised association cannot file a petition under Art. 32. Whether the petitioners belong to a recognised union or not, the fact remains that a large body of persons with a common grievance exist and they have approached the Supreme Court under Art. 32. The following observation by the Court is worth noting.18 \"Our current processual jurisprudence is not of individualistic Anglo-Indian mould. It is broad-based and people-oriented, and envisions access to justice through 'class actions', 'public interest litigation', and 'representative proceedings'. Indeed, little Indians in large numbers seeking remedies in Courts through collective proceedings, instead of being driven to an expensive plurality of litigations, is an affirmation of participative justice in our democracy. We have no hesitation in holding that the narrow concept of 'cause of action' and 'person aggrieved' and individual litigation is becoming obsolescent in some jurisdictions.\" The Fertilizer Corporation, a government company, proposed to sell some old machinery. The labour union filed a petition under Art. 32 in the Supreme Court challenging the sale. The Court conceded legal standing to the union to file the petition. A worker clearly has interest in the industry and so he will have standing to challenge any wrong doing by the Management. Chandrachud, C.J., emphasized that in appropriate cases, it might become necessary to take a broader view of the question of locus standi to initiate proceeding. \"If public property is dissipated, it would require a strong argument to convince the Court that ... a section of the public which is directly interested and affected would have no right to complain of the infraction of public duties and obligations\". Page 143 Krishna Iyer, J., in a separate opinion explicitly advocated liberalisation of the locus standi to meet the challenge of times. If a plaintiff with a good case is turned away merely because he is not sufficiently affected personally, that means that some government agency is left free to violate the law, and this is contrary to public interest. While the union had locus standi to file the petition, in the ultimate analysis the petition was dismissed on merits on two grounds: (1) the decision of the corporation to sell the old machinery could not be legally faulted; (2) no question of breach of Fundamental Rights of the workers arose to justify a petition under Art. 32.19 Reference may also be made in this connection to Public Interest Litigation which is discussed later in this book.20 In the present context, the Supreme Court takes a liberal view of locus standi to file a writ petition under Art. 32. The concept of locus standi has been very much expanded and the Supreme Court has come to adopt a flexible view on the question of a person's entitlement to file a writ petition to challenge an executive order as ultra vires. This is supported by Jayaraj21 where the Supreme Court proceeded to consider the question on its merits whether an order made by the Excise Commissioner was legal or not without going into the question whether the petitioner challenging the order had locus standi to do so or not with the remark that if the impuged order was in violation of law \"we do not wish to nip the motion out solely on the ground of locus standi\". If the executive had no authority to pass the order impugned, \"it would be improper to allow such an order to remain alive and operative on the sole ground that the person who filed the writ petition has strictly no locus standi\". It is not necessary that the victim of the violation of the Fundamental Rights should personally approach the Court for redress as the Court can itself take cognisance of the matter and proceed suo motu, or on a petition filed by any public spirited individual.22 (o) RELIEF UNDER ART. 32 The phraseology of Art. 32(2) is very broad. Thereunder the Supreme Court is authorized to issue orders, directions, or writs, \"including\" writs, \"in the nature of\" mandamus, certiorari, prohibition, quo warranto and habeas corpus.23 A few comments may be made on this provision. Under Art. 32, the Supreme Court may issue not only the specified writs but also make any order, or given any directions as it may consider appropriate in the circumstance of the case, to give proper relief to the petitioner. The Court can grant declaration or injunction as well if that be the proper relief.24 The Court can mould relief to meet the exigencies of the specific circumstances.25 What is the appropriate remedy to be given to the petitioner for the enforcement of his Fundamental Right is a matter for the Court to decide. In the words of the Court:26\"The jurisdiction enjoyed by this Court under Art.",

    "content": "the words of the Court:26\"The jurisdiction enjoyed by this Court under Art. 32 is very wide as this Court, while conceding a petition for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights...., can declare an Act to be ultra vires or beyond the competence of the legislature....\" The Court has discretion in the matter of framing writs to suit the exigencies of particular cases. The petition cannot be thrown out merely because he has not prayed for a proper writ or direction. While issuing writs, the Court is not bound to follow all the technicalities which surround these writs in Britain.27 The power of the Supreme Court is not restricted to the five writs specifically mentioned in Art. 32(2). This is because of two reasons, viz.: (1) The power of the Court is 'inclusive'; (2) The Court has power to issue writs \"in the nature of\" the specified five writs. This means that the Court has flexibility in the matter of issuing writs. Page 144 The Court has explained the position in M.C. Mehta v. Union of India:28 \"....This Court under Art. 32(1) is free to devise any procedure appropriate for the particular purpose of the proceeding namely, enforcement of a Fundamental Right and under Art. 32(1) the Court has the implicit power to issue whatever direction, order or writ is necessary in a given case, including all incidental or ancillary power necessary to secure enforcement of the Fundamental Right\". DAMAGES In course of time, the Supreme Court has given a new dimension to Art. 32 and has implied therefrom the power to award damages/compensation when a Fundamental Right of a person has been infringed and there is no other suitable remedy available to give relief and redress in the specific situation for the injury caused to the petitioner. The Court has argued that under Art. 32, its power is not only injunctive in ambit, that is, preventing the infringement of a Fundamental Right, but it is also remedial in scope. Therefore, the Court cannot only injunct violation of a Fundamental Right but also give relief when the right has already been violated. The Court has maintained that in the absence of such a power, Art. 32 would be robbed of all its efficacy, become emasculated and rendered futile and become impotent.29 Therefore, a person can seek remedial assistance under Art. 32 when his Fundamental Right has been violated. As the Court has pointed out in the case noted below.30 \"It is in the matter of enforcement of Fundamental Rights that the Court has the right to award damages to compensate the loss caused to a person on account of violation of his Fundamental Rights.\" This, indeed, is a major contribution made by the Supreme Court towards the protection of Fundamental Rights against undue interference by administrative authorities, as situations may arise when only compensation could provide some relief to the affected person and no writ or order could fill the bill. For example, in Rudul Sah v. State of Bihar, 31 in a writ petition for habeas corpus, the Court awarded damages to the petitioner against the State for breach of his right of personal liberty guaranteed by Art. 21 as he was kept in jail for 14 years even after his acquittal by a criminal Court. The fact situation revealed \"a sordid and disturbing state of affairs\" for which the responsibility lay squarely on the Administration. The Court felt that not awarding damages in the instant case would \"be doing merely lip service to the Fundamental Right to liberty which the State Government has so grossly violated\". Since Rudul Shah, compensation has been awarded in quite a few cases to the victims or their kith and kin, for police brutality, or atrocities or harassment.32 The Supreme Court has observed in this connection in CERC:33 \"It is, therefore, settled law that in public law claim for compensation is a remedy available under Article 32 or 226 for the enforcement and protection of fundamental and human rights. The defence of sovereign immunity is inapplicable and alien to the concept of guarantee of Fundamental Rights...\"34 In Bodhisattwa Gautam v. Subhra Chakraborty, 35 the Supreme Court awarded an interim compensation to the woman raped. The rapist was directed to pay Rs. 1000/- pm to the concerned woman pending the criminal case against him. A significant recent judicial pronouncement on the question of monetary compensation under its writ jurisdiction is Chairman, Railway Board v. Chandrima Das .36 Though the case has arisen under Art. 226 yet the principles laid down therein are equally relevant to writ petitions under Art. 32 and the case may appropriately be mentioned here. A Bangladeshi woman was gang raped by some railway employees in the railway premises at the Howrah Railway Station. A practising lawyer filed a writ petition in the High Court under Art. 226 as public interest litigation.37 The High Court awarded damages to the victim against the Railways. On appeal, the Supreme Page 145 Court upheld the High Court decision. It was held to be a violation of the rights of the victim under Art. 21 which was available not only to citizens but also to non-citizens as well. The Court rejected the contention that the matter ought to have been raised through a civil suit rather than a writ petition with the following observation:38 \"...the contention that the victim should have approached the Civil Court for damages and the matter should not have been considered in a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution cannot be accepted. Where public functionaries are involved and the matter relates to the violation of the Fundamental Rights or the enforcement of public duties, the remedy would still be available under the Public Law notwithstanding that a suit could be filed for damages under Private Law. In the instant case, it is not a mere matter of violation of an ordinary right of a person but the violation of Fundamental Right which is involved. Mrs.",

Where public functionaries are involved and the matter relates to the violation of the Fundamental Rights or the enforcement of public duties, the remedy would still be available under the Public Law notwithstanding that a suit could be filed for damages under Private Law. In the instant case, it is not a mere matter of violation of an ordinary right of a person but the violation of Fundamental Right which is involved. Mrs. Hanuffa Khatoon was a victim of rape. The Court in Bodhisattwa v. Ms. Subhra Chakraborty39 has held \"rape\" as an offence which is violative of the Fundamental Right of a person guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.\" Another objection raised was that the petition was filed not by the victim herself but by a practising lawyer. Rejecting the objection, the Court ruled in favour of the locus standi of the petitioner because the petition claimed not only compensation but several other reliefs and it was filed in public interest.40 A review of the cases show that the Court has granted damages inter alia in the following categories of cases:41 (1) where the petitioner has suffered personal injuries at the hands of government servants by their tortious acts;42 (2) police atrocities;43 (3) custodial deaths;44 (4) medical negligence;45 (5) environmental pollution.46 In cases of environmental pollution, the Supreme Court has advocated the principle of polluter pays. On the question of award of damages for environmental pollution, the Supreme Court has observed in M.C. Mehta v. Kamal Nath47 that pollution being a civil wrong against the community as a whole, the Supreme Court has power under Art. 32 to award compensation to the victims of pollution in a writ petition under Art. 32 against a person causing pollution. The damages may fall under the following heads: (i) damages for restoration of the environment and ecology; (ii) damages to those who may have suffered loss on account of the act of pollution; (iii) exemplary damages so that other people are deterred from causing environmental pollution. But the Court cannot impose pollution fine on the polluter under Art. 32. That can be done only through a criminal prosecution of the polluter under the relevant law. The principle of awarding damages for breach of Fundamental Rights has been recently reiterated by the Supreme Court in Rabindra Nath Ghosal v. University of Calcutta:48 \"The Courts having the obligation to satisfy the social aspiration of the citizens have to apply the tool and grant compensation as damages in a public law proceedings consequently when the Court moulds the relief in proceedings under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution seeking enforcement or protection of fundamental rights and grants compensation, it does so under the public law by way of penalising the wrongdoer and fixing the liability for the public wrong on the state which has failed in its public duty to protect the fundamental rights of the citizens.\" (p) POWER TO ISSUE GENERAL DIRECTIONS While the basic purpose underlying Art. 32 is to empower the Supreme Court to give relief to an aggrieved person whose Fundamental Right has been infringed, the Court has used Art. 32 for a much wider purpose than that, viz., to lay down general guidelines having the effect of law to fill the vacuum till such time the legislature steps in to fill in the gap by making the necessary law. The Court derives such a power by reading Art. 32 with Art. 142 and Art. 141. Art. 144 mandates all authorities to act in aid of the Court orders.49 Page 146 The Court has stated in Visakha,50that it is the duty of the executive to fill the vacuum by executive orders because its field is coterminous with that of the legislature. And where even the executive does not act, the judiciary must step in, in exercise of its constitutional obligation under the abovementioned constitutional provisions to provide a solution till the legislature acts to perform its role by enacting a proper legislation to cover the field. In the instant case, to deal with the problem of sexual harassment of women at work place, the Court issued guidelines to be observed' in all work places until suitable legislation is enacted to occupy the field. In Union of India v. Association for Democratic Reforms,51 the Supreme Court issued certain directions to the Election Commission.52 Justifying this, the Supreme Court observed : \"....It is not possible for this Court to give any directions for amending the Act or the statutory Rules. It is for Parliament to amend the Act and the Rules. It is also established law that no direction can be given, which would be contrary to the Act and the Rules. However, it is equally settled that in case when the Act or Rules are silent on a particular subject and the authority implementing the same has constitutional or statutory power to implement it, the Court can necessarily issue directions or orders on the said subject to fill the vacuum or void till the suitable law is enacted.\"53 The Court has asserted that where there is inaction by the executive, for whatever reason, the Court must step in, in exercise of its constitutional obligations to provide a solution till such time, the legislature acts to perform its role by enacting proper legislation to cover the field. If necessary the Court can issue directions, in an appropriate case, even to private persons for the enforcement of the petitioner's Fundamental Rights.54 The Court has issued guidelines and directions in quite a few cases. Some of these cases are: (1) Lakshmi Kant Pandey v. Union of India, 55 where guidelines for adoption of minor children by foreigners were laid down.",

(2) Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association v. Union of India,56 where the Supreme Court laid down guidelines and norms for the appointment and transfer of High Court Judges.57 (3) Visakha v. State of Rajasthan, 58 where elaborate guidelines have been laid down to discourage sexual harassment of women in work places. (4) Vineet Narain v. Union of India, 59 where the Court has laid down directions to ensure the independence of the Vigilance Commission and to reduce corruption among government servants. This has been done to implement the Rule of Law \"wherein the concept of equality enshrined in Art. 14 is embedded.\" The Court has done so as no legislation has been enacted covering the said filed to ensure proper implementation of the rule of law. (5) Common Cause v. Union of India, 60 where the Supreme Court issued directions for revamping the system of blood banks in the country. (6) Vishwa Jagriti Mission v. Central Government ;61 where the Court has issued guidelines against ragging in educational institutions. The directions issued by the Supreme Court under Art. 32 have the force of law.62 These directions remain in force till the legislature enacts a suitable law. The general directions issued by the Court are, thus, quasi-legislative in nature for they bind not only the parties to the specific dispute before the Court but even others. Breach of these directions amounts to contempt of Court.63 This cases impart a much broader dimension to Art. 32. B. PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION Some reference has already been made to public interest litigation under Art. 226.64 A little more may be said on this subject which arises not only under Art. 226 but also under Art. 32. Page 147 It may however be emphasized that a PIL writ petition can be filed in the Supreme Court under Art. 32 only if a question concerning the enforcement of a Fundamental Right is involved. Under Art. 226, a writ petition can be filed in a High Court whether or not a Fundamental Right is involved. The Supreme Court has entertained a number of petitions under Art. 32 complaining of infraction of Fundamental Rights of individuals, or of weak or oppressed groups who are unable themselves to take the initiative to vindicate their own rights. The Supreme Court has ruled that to exercise its jurisdiction under Art. 32, it is not necessary that the affected person should personally approach the Court. The Court can itself take congnizance of the matter and proceed suo motu or on a petition of any public spirited individual or body.65 And, a private interest case can also be treated as public interest case. The writ petitioner before the High Court was a firm of a Chartered Accountant. As an expert in accountancy and auditing, it must have come across several cases where its client had to pay a higher amount of interest to the banks pursuant to or in furtherance of the impugned action of the banks which were members of appellants. By reason of such actions of the banks as also RBI, the citizens of India had to pay a higher amount of tax as also a higher amount of interest for no fault on their part. The same had been recovered from them without any authority of law. The Court directed the Comptroller and Auditor General to effect recoveries of all the excess amount realized by the Union of India by way of interest tax and interest by the banks and other financial institution.66 But relying on BALCO Employees' Union (Regd.) v. Union of India, 67 the Court has again reminded that the only ground on which a person can maintain a PIL is where there has been an element of violation of Article 21 on human rights or where the litigation has been initiated for the benefit of the poor and the underprivileged who are unable to come to the court due to some disadvantage.68 The Hussainara Khatoon cases69 to vindicate the right of personal liberty under Art. 21 of the Bihar undertrials started with an article written by K.F. Rustamji in the Indian Express where he pointed out how undertrial prisoners were languishing in jails in Bihar for years without trial. An advocate, Kapila Hingorani, then filed a petition under Art. 32 in the Supreme Court to protect the personal liberty of the undertrials.70 Reference has already been made to the Asiad case.71 This case was brought before the Supreme Court under Art. 32 by an organisation devoted to the protection of democratic rights of the people complaining of the breaches of many labour laws as regards the workers engaged in the construction of the Asiad projects.",

    "content": "J., emphasized that public interest litigation is \"a strategic arm of the legal aid movement\" \"which is intended to bring justice within the reach of the poor masses who constitute the low visibility area of humanity\".72 The most significant point to note in regard to Public Interest Litigation is that it discards the traditional concept of locus standi which means that only the person whose legal rights are being violated can approach the Court for redress.73 Bhagwati, J., has stated on this point: \"A new dimension has been given to the doctrine of locus standi which has revolutionised the whole concept of access to justice.\" The Court has enunciated the need to relax the locus standi rule in the following words: \"This Court has taken the view that, having regard to the peculiar socio-econo-mic conditions prevailing in the country where there is considerable poverty, illiteracy and ignorance obstructing and impeding accessibility to the judicial process, it would result in closing the doors of justice to the poor and deprived sections of the community if the traditional rule of standing....that only a person wronged can sue for judicial redress were to be blindly adhered to and followed and it is therefore necessary to evolve a new strategy by relaxing this traditional rule of standing in order that justice may become easily available to the lowly and the lost.\" In Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India, 74 the Supreme Court entertained a matter concerning release of bonded labour raised by an organisation dedicated to the cause of release of bonded labour. The Court rebuked the State Government for raising a preliminary objection to stall an inquiry by the Court into the matter in the following words:75 \"We should have thought that if any citizen brings before the Court a complaint that a large number of peasants or Page 148 workers are bonded serfs or are being subjected to exploitation by a few mine lessees or contractors or employers or are being denied the benefits of social welfare laws, the State Government, which is, under our constitutional scheme, charged with the mission of bringing about a new socio-economic order where there will be social and economic justice for every one and equality of status and opportunity for all, would welcome an inquiry by the Court, so that if it is found that there are in fact bonded labourers such a situation can be set right by the State Government.\" The Court then went on to emphasize that \"public interest litigation is not in the nature of adversary litigation but it is a challenge and an opportunity to the Government and its officers to make basic human rights meaningful to the deprived and vulnerable sections of the community and to assure them social and economic justice which is the signature tune of our Constitution.\"76 The Court explained the philosophy underlying public interest litigation as follows:77 \".... where a person or class of persons to whom legal injury is caused by reason of violation of a Fundamental Right is unable to approach the Court for judicial redress on account of poverty or disability or socially or economically disadvantaged position, any member of the public acting bona fide can move the Court for relief under Article 32 and a fortiorari also under Article 226, so that the Fundamental Rights may become meaningful not only for the rich and the well to do who have the means to approach the Court but also for the large masses of people who are living a life of want and destitution and who are by reason of lack of awareness, assertiveness and resources unable to seek judicial redress.\" Bhagwati, J., pointed out that in the words of Art. 32(1), there is no limitation that the Fundamental Right sought to be enforced must belong to the person moving the Court. Nor does Art. 32(1) say that the Supreme Court should be moved only by a particular kind of proceeding. \"It is clear on the plain language of clause (1) of Art. 32 that whenever there is a violation of a Fundamental Right, any one can move the Supreme Court for enforcement of such Fundamental Right.\" When there is violation of a Fundamental Right of a person or a class of persons who cannot have resort to the Court because of poverty or disability or socially or economically disadvantaged position, the Court must allow any member of the public acting bona fide to espouse the cause of such person or persons and move the Court for judicial enforcement of the Fundamental Right of such person or class of persons. Public interest litigation now serves a much broader function than merely espousal of the grievances of the weak and the disadvantaged persons. It is now being used to ventilate public grievances where the society as a whole, rather than a specific individual, feels aggrieved. If the traditional rule of locus standi is adhered to, such public grievances could not be brought before the Court by any individual. As Bhagwati, J., has explained in Asiad, public interest litigation is brought before the Court not for the purpose of enforcing the rights of one individual against another as happens in the case of ordinary litigation. Under this category, a large number of cases raising all kinds of socio-economic and administrative problems affecting the public generally, such as protection of the environment, misuse of powers by Ministers, etc., have been brought before the Supreme Court and the High Courts.",

    "content": "principle was enunciated by the Court as early as 1982 in S.P. Gupta v. Union of India, where Bhagwati, J., stated: \"Any member of the public having sufficient interest can maintain an action for judicial redress for public injury arising from breach of public duty or from violation of some provision of the Constitution or the law and seek enforcement of such public duty and observance of such constitutional or legal provision.\" Public interest litigation should not, however, be used by a petitioner as a means to grind a personal axe. The petitioner should not be inspired by malice or a design to malign others, orbe actuated by selfish or personal motives or by political or oblique considerations. He should be acting bona fide and with a view to vindicate the cause of justice. One finds a very elaborate discussion on the philosophy, mechanics and purpose of PIL in the Supreme Court decision in Janata Dal v. H.S. Chowdhary .78 A very significant aspect of the decision is laying the credentials which a writ petitioner filing a PIL should fulfil. The Court has observed:79 \"...The strict rule of locus standi applicable to private litigation is relaxed and a broad rule is evolved which gives the Page 149 right of locus standi to any member of the public acting bona fide and having sufficient interest in instituting an action for redressal of public wrong or public injury, but who is not a mere busy body or a meddlesome interloper; since the dominant object of PIL is to ensure observance of the provisions of the Constitution or the law which can be best achieved to advance the cause of community or disadvantaged groups and individuals or public interest by permitting any person, having no personal gain or private motivation or any other oblique consideration but acting bona fide and having sufficient interest in maintaining an action for judicial redress for public injury to put the judicial machinery in motion like actio popularis of Roman Law whereby any citizen could bring such an action in respect of a public delict.\" In the instant case, the Court ruled that the writ petitioner had no locus standi to file the PIL writ petition. The Court came to the conclusion that the petition had been filed not for the promotion of public interest but for the protection of certain accused persons. A PIL would only be entertained if a segment of the public is interested, and the petitioner is not aggrieved in his individual capacity alone. And, it is not a charter for ignoring or supplanting an applicable statutory provisions.80 The Supreme Court has cautioned that public interest litigation is a weapon which has to be used with great care and circumspection and that the judiciary has to be careful to see that under the guise of redressing a public grievance it does not encroach upon the sphere reserved by the Constitution to the executive and the legislature.81 For example a PIL filed by person who had not even responded to the invitation to participate in a project is liable to be rejected.82 The Supreme Court has even taken cognizance of letters from individuals complaining of the infraction of Fundamental Rights and has treated such letters as writ petitions.83 Explaining the reason for such a procedure, Bhagwati, J., has said in Bandhua Mukti Morcha84 that when a member of the public acting bona fide moves the Court for enforcement of a Fundamental Right on behalf of a person, or class of persons, who on account of poverty or disability or socially or economically disadvantaged position cannot approach the Court for relief, such member of the public may move the Court even by just writing a letter, because it would not be right or fair to expect a person acting pro bono publico to incur expenses out of his own pocket to approach a lawyer and prepare a regular writ petition for being filed in the Court for enforcement of the Fundamental Rights of the poor. In such a case, a letter addressed by him can legitimately be regarded as an \"appropriate\" proceeding.85 Lakshmi Kant Pandey v. Union of India, 86 was initiated on the basis of a letter by an advocate complaining of malpractices indulged in by social organisations in the matter of offering Indian children in adoption to foreign parents. He based his letter on press reports on this issue. The Court formulated a series of guidelines to be applied in such matters. It is now accepted that under Art. 226, a High Court may entertain grievances received through letters and treat the same as writ petitions.87 As the Supreme Court has said in Bandhua Mukti Morcha,88 that whatever has been said in relation to Art. 32 applies equally in relation to Art. 226 for this also is a constitutional jurisdiction and, in fact, Art. 226 is much wider in scope than Art. 32. At times, a High Court may even take up a matter under Art. 226 suo motu. According to a news item,89 the Bombay High Court invited voluntary organisations and the Government authorities to find a judicial solution to the problem of roofless and rootless children who are brought to Bombay for labour but later take to crime. The Court wanted to consider whether it could direct a survey of such destitute children and whether the State Government could be made to provide healthy environment so as to ensure freedom and dignity to such children. To mention a few typical PIL cases: In R.L. & E. Kendra, Dehradum v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 90 the Supreme Court ordered closure of certain lime-stone quarries in the foot hills of the Himalayas as their working was disturbing ecological balance in the area.",

    "content": "on the case, the Court observed: \"....This is the first case of its kind in the country involving issues relating to environment and ecological balance...It brings into sharp focus the conflict between development and conservation and services to emphasize the need for reconciling the two in the larger interest of the country.\" Page 150 Since then innumerable PIL cases have been filed in the Supreme Court raising problems of ecology and environmental pollution. Some of these cases have already been taken note of earlier.91 In Chaitanya Kumar v. State of Karnataka, 92 a contract awarded by the State Government to a few persons was set aside. The Court observed: \"The Court cannot close its eyes and persuade itself to uphold publicly mischievous executive actions which have been so exposed... When arbitrariness and perversion are writ large and brought out clearly, the Court cannot shirk its duty and refuse its writ. Advancement of the public interest and avoidance of the public mischief are the paramount considerations. As always the Court is concerned with the balancing of interests.\" In Gaurav Jain v. Union of India, 1 a question was raised concerning rehabilitation of the children of prostitutes. The Court issued suitable directions for the purpose. The Court has again explained the nature of public interest litigation in Sheela Barse v. Union of India :2 \"The technique of public interest litigation serves to provide an effective remedy to enforce group rights and interests.\" Many a time, important public issues involving interpretation of constitutional provisions are raised through PIL.3 The grievance in a public interest action, generally speaking, \"is about the content and conduct of governmental action in relation to the constitutional or statutory rights of segments of society and in certain circumstances the conduct of government policies.\" To facilitate filing of such cases by public minded citizens, the Court has lowered the \"locus standi thresholds\".4 The dispute is not comparable to one between private parties and the relief is generally \"corrective\" rather than \"compensatory\". It is wrong on the part of a High Court allow a writ petition without taking into consideration the locus standi of the writ petitioners having regard to the specific plea of the respondent statutory authority.5 The Court may refuse to take cognisance of a public interest litigation petition if there is undue delay on the part of the petitioner to file the same.6 The range and scope of public interest litigation is vast as it is a mechanism to agitate any socio-economic public issue before the Court which can be brought within the legal and constitutional mould.7 PIL is the result of judicial activism. The basic reason for the growth of PIL in India is bureaucratic unresponsiveness to public needs. No effective mechanism has been established as yet for the redressal of public grievances against the Administration. The result is that any person having a grievance against the Administration has no alternative but to take recourse to the courts for the redressal of his grievance against the Administration. PIL has flourished in India mainly because of the lack of any sense of accountability and responsibility on the part of the government. Had the Administration discharged its role faithfully and effectively, there would be no need for people to knock at the doors of the courts to assert their rights and ensure that the Administration acts according to law. Many statutes remain on the statute book without the Administration taking any steps to implement the same. On the other hand, the courts have played their role in a constructive manner with a view to promote the welfare of the people and strengthen the democratic fabric in the country. At the same time, the increase of the inflow of public interest litigation and the abuse thereof has prompted the Supreme Court to sound a precautionary note: \"Some persons with vested interest indulge in the pastime of meddling with judicial process either by force of habit or from improper motives, and try to bargain for a good deal as well as to enrich themselves. Often they are actuated by a desire to win notoriety or cheap popularity. The petitions of such busybodies deserve to be thrown out by rejection at the threshold, and in appropriate cases with exemplary costs\".8 C. MILITARY LAW AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS Page 151 Article 33 of the Constitution constitutes an exception to the Fundamental Rights. A government servant is also entitled to enjoy Fundamental Rights. A person does not lose his Fundamental Rights ipso facto by joining government service. But, under Art. 33, Parliament is endowed with power to restrict or abrogate the Fundamental Rights of a few categories of government servants. Article 33 empowers Parliament to determine, by law, to what extent any of the Fundamental Rights shall in its application to-- (a) the members of the Armed Forces; or (b) the members of the forces charged with the maintenance of public order; or (c) persons employed in any bureau or other organisation established by the state for purposes of intelligence or counter intelligence; or (d) persons employed in, or in connection with the telecommunication systems set up for the purposes of any force, bureau or organisation referred to in clauses (a), (b) and (c), be restricted or abrogated so as to ensure the proper discharge of their duties and the maintenance of discipline among them. Art. 33 does not by itself abrogate any rights; its applicability depends upon Parliamentary legislation. Parliament can, in exercise of powers conferred by Art. 33 restrict or abrogate the Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution in their application to the members of the armed forces. It, therefore, follows that if any provision of the Act or the Rules restricts or abrogates any right guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution, it cannot be challenged on the ground that it is violative of the Fundamental Rights as guaranteed under Part III.",

    "content": "restrict or abrogate the Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution in their application to the members of the armed forces. It, therefore, follows that if any provision of the Act or the Rules restricts or abrogates any right guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution, it cannot be challenged on the ground that it is violative of the Fundamental Rights as guaranteed under Part III. It is no doubt true that the restriction or abrogation is dependent on parliamentary legislation and only a law passed by vitue of Art. 33 can override Arts. 21 and 22.9 The expression \"members of the Armed Forces\" used in (a) above covers such civilian employees of the armed forces as barbers, carpenters, mechanics, etc. Although these persons are non-combatants, nevertheless, they are integral to the armed forces and, therefore, their Fundamental Rights can also be curtailed under Art. 33.10 Article 33 selects only a few services for special treatment, such as, military and para-military forces, police forces and analogous forces. Art. 33 does not exclude any other category of civil servants from the purview of Fundamental Rights by reason of being government servants.11 This provision may, therefore, be treated as an exception to the Fundamental Rights. A law enacted by Parliament governing the armed forces cannot be challenged on the ground that it infringes any Fundamental Right. The power is conferred on Parliament and not on the State Legislatures. Maintenance of law and order being a State subject,12 the law governing the forces charged with the maintenance of public order falls within the State sphere. Nevertheless, such a State law cannot abrogate a Fundamental Right of a member of such force.13 This can only be done by Parliament under Art. 33. Parliament is entitled to lay down to what extent Fundamental Rights can be modified by State legislation applicable to the forces charged with the maintenance of public order. Parliament has enacted the Public Forces (Restriction of Rights) Act, 1966, for restricting certain Fundamental Rights of the members of police forces functioning under the several statutes listed in the schedule to the Act. A member of the police force is prohibited, without the consent of the Central Government, or of the prescribed authority, from being a member of any trade union, labour union or political association or of any organisation which is not recognised as part of the force of which he is a member, or is not purely social, recreational or religious in nature. He cannot communicate with the press or publish any book, letter or any other document except where it is being published in the bona fide discharge of his duties, or the communication is of a purely literary, artistic or scientific character, or of any other prescribed nature. No member of the police force is to participate in any meeting or demonstration organised for any political purpose or any other purpose prohibited by the rules made under the Act. Breach of these provisions is punishable with imprisonment and fine. Page 152 The Act and the rules made thereunder are protected by Art. 33. The ban placed on a member of a police force from becoming a member of any trade union or labour union has been upheld by the Supreme Court.14 The ban was placed by the Central Government under the rules made under the Police Forces (Restriction of Rights) Act, 1966. The members of the police force are in a less advantageous position as curtailment of their rights under Art. 19(1)(c) falls squarely within Art. 33 in the interest of discipline and public order.15Under Art. 33, Parliament has power to restrict or abrogate the Fundamental Rights in their relation to the Armed Forces including Police Force which is invested with powers to maintain public order. The rules made under the Act restricting the Fundamental Rights of the police force cannot be challenged because of Art. 33. The Army Act restricts and abrogates some of the Fundamental Rights of the members of the Armed Forces. Parliament derives its competence to curtail the Fundamental Rights of Armed Forces from Art. 33. The Army Act also covers the \"camp followers\" of the Army like carpenters, tailors, cooks, sweepers, etc.16 Parliament has also recently enacted the Intelligence Organisations (Restriction of Rights) Act, 1985, restricting certain Fundamental Rights in their application to the members of certain central intelligence agencies. This has been done with a view to curb the tendency of indiscipline in such intelligence agencies as Intelligence Bureau and Research and Analysis Wing. The Act prohibits the staff of these agencies from participating in trade union activities, or associating with political organisations or communicating with the press. It is a cognisable criminal offence to do so. Beyond the restrictions which Parliament may impose under Art. 33(a) on the Fundamental Rights of certain categories of public servants, the government servant, in general, continues to enjoy his Fundamental Rights. Generally speaking, a government servant does not lose his Fundamental Rights by accepting government service. The Supreme Court has rejected the broad contention that the persons in the service of government form a class apart from the rest of the citizens and, therefore, Fundamental Rights, in general, do not apply to them. Nevertheless, some restraints may validly be imposed on their rights by the Service Rules in order to maintain discipline amongst them and to ensure proper and effective discharge of duties and obligations by them. Thus, Service Rules can be framed to maintain efficiency and discipline among the ranks of government servants. As the Supreme Court has observed: \"......",

    "content": "government service has, implicit in it, if not explicitly so laid down, the observance of a certain code of conduct necessary for the proper discharge of functions as a government servant.\" But the Supreme Court has also insisted that there is need to have \"a proper balancing of interests of an individual as a citizen and the right of the State to frame a code of conduct for its employees in the interest of proper functioning of the State.\"17 A number of cases have arisen challenging the restraints imposed on government servants.18 COURT MARTIAL The tribunals, known as the courts-martial, are established under the Military law. The Supreme Court has described a Court-martial as follows:19 \"It has been rightly said that Court-martial remains to a significant degree, a specialised part of overall mechanism by which the military discipline is preserved. It is for the special need for the armed forces that a person subject to Army Act is tried by Court-martial for anact which is an offence under the Act. Court-martial discharges judicial function and to a great extent is a Court where provisions of Evidence Act are applicable. A Court-martial has also the same responsibility as any Court to protect the rights of the accused charged before it and follow the procedural safeguards.\" These tribunals have been excluded by Art. 136(2) from the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction under Art. 136(1).20 According to Art. 136(2), nothing in Art. 136(1) \"shall apply to any judgment, determination, sentence or order passed or made by any Court or tribunal constituted by or under any law relating to the Armed Forces\". These tribunals have also been excluded from the power of superintendence vested in a High Court under Art. 227 [ Art. 227(4)]. The military tribunals are not, however, exempt from the Supreme Court's writ jurisdiction under Art. 32 and Page 153 the High Court's writ jurisdiction under Art. 226. A High Court can, thus, intervene if inter alia a Court martial is not properly constituted, or acts against natural justice, or acts outside its jurisdiction, or there is an error apparent on the face of the record. Art. 32 can be invoked if there is denial of any Fundamental Right.21 However, the Fundamental Rights of the armed forces can be curtailed under Art. 33 under a Parliamentary law and, to that extent, the courts-martial can be excluded from the purview of Arts. 32 and 226. In Ram Sarup v. Union of India, 22the petitioner who was subject to the Army Act, 1950, was tried by the general Court martial and sentenced to death. The sentence was confirmed by the Central Government. He filed a petition in theSupreme Court under Art. 32 for a writ of habeas corpus contending inter aliathat the provisions of the Army Act infringed Art. 14 and that his trial was vitiated under Art. 22(1) as he had not been allowed to be defended at the Court-martial by a legal practitioner of his own choice. The Supreme Courtrejected his petition and held the provisions of the Army Act valid on two alternative grounds: (1) they did not infringe Art. 14; (2) even if they did, they would be valid under Art. 33. A provision in the Army Act enacted by Parliament would not be bad even if inconsistent with a Fundamental Right for it must then be taken that Parliament has thereby, in exercise of its power under Art. 33, made the requisite modification to affect application of the respective Fundamental Rights to the army personnel. The Court also held that as the petitioner has made no request for being defended by a lawyer of his choice, no question of refusing permission for the same arose, and hence there was no violation of Art. 22(2).23 The Ram Sarup proposition has been reiterated in Prithi Pal Singh Bedi v. Union of India .24Certain provisions of the Army Act, 1950, were challenged as being in conflict with Art. 21. Rejecting the challenge, theSupreme Court ruled that under Art. 33, Parliament has the power to restrict or abrogate any of the Fundamental Rights in their application to the members of the armed forces so as to ensure the proper discharge of duties and maintenance of discipline amongst them. Article 33 does not obligate Parliament to specifically adumbrate each Fundamental Right and to specify in the law enacted under Art. 33 the degree of restriction or total abrogation of each right. Every provision of the Army Act, if in conflict with the Fundamental Rights, shall have to be read subject to Art. 33 as being enacted with a view to either restricting or abrogating other Fundamental Rights to the extent of inconsistency or repugnancy between the Fundamental Rights and the Army Act. The law prescribing procedure for trial of offences by Court martial does not have to satisfy the requirements of Art. 21 because to the extent the procedure is prescribed by law and if it stands in derogation of Art. 21, to that extent, Art. 21 in its application to the armed forces is modified by enactment of the procedure in the Army Act itself. This means that Parliament can legislate under Art. 33 without any regard to Fundamental Rights.25 The Apex Court has ruled in Union of India v. A. Hussain, 26 that if a Court-martial is properly convened and where there is no challenge to the composition of the Court-martial, and the proceedings are in accordance with the procedure prescribed, the High Court ought not to interfere. Where there was no irregularity or illegality and the respondent was provided with reasonable opportunity to defend himself and the proceedings were fair, there would be no occasion for a High Court to interfere under Art. 226. In General Court Martial v. Aniltej Singh Dhaliwal, 27 the Supreme Court quashed one of the four charges on which the accused officer was convicted by the Court-martial.",

In General Court Martial v. Aniltej Singh Dhaliwal, 27 the Supreme Court quashed one of the four charges on which the accused officer was convicted by the Court-martial. The Supreme Court referred the matter back to the Court-martial for considering and passing an appropriate sentence on the basis of the three charges sustained. The matter had reached the Supreme Court by way of an appeal from the High Court decision in a writ petition under Art. 226 by which the decision of the Court-martial was quashed. The proceedings of the Court-martial to be effective have to be confirmed by the Chief of the Army Staff. He need not give reasons for his order of confirmation.28 D. MARTIAL LAW Page 154 Article 34 of the Constitution uses the term 'Martial Law' without defining it. The term 'martial law' is used in several senses. It is used to express, in the first place, the powers exercisable by the general in command of army over the inhabitants of an enemy country during war. This is more a matter of international, rather than of domestic, law. In the second sense, the expression is used to denote military law, i.e., the law applicable to the armed forces, for which there exists Art. 33, as discussed above.29 Here, in this place, the term 'martial law' is being used in the third sense, that is, a 'condition of affairs,' rather than as a 'code of rules', which arises when there is a state of war, insurrection or rebellion in any part of the country. When such a situation arises, force necessary in the circumstances to restore order may be used, and this use of force is characterised as martial law. Martial law is thus the action of the military authorities when, in order to deal with a situation amounting to insurrection or war within the country, they impose restrictions and regulations on civilians. The basis of the power of the military in such a situation is the rule that every citizen (whether a soldier or not) is under a duty to assist in the suppression of riotous assemblies and insurrections, in the maintenance of order and in repelling invaders. This clothes the military with an authority to repel force by force and take all necessary steps to preserve order. During the period of a major emergency, the military authorities may exercise abnormal powers outside the ordinary law.30 Such a right is essential for the very survival of an orderly government. During the period of rebellion or insurrection, the military authorities may find it necessary to interfere with the actions, life and liberty of the civilians. The military may enforce obedience to its orders by punishing the civilians, and, in exceptional circumstances, may even condemn them to death. To establish whether breaches of duty have been committed and, if so, to punish the offenders, military tribunals may be established to try the civilians. These tribunals are not, however, considered as courts, in the strict sense of the term, and are not bound by ordinary law or procedure. They are merely committees of officers to advise the military commander as to the action he should take in carrying out his duties.31 As these tribunals are not courts in the eyes of law, no Court can exercise any appellate jurisdiction over them, or issue any writ against them, or take cognisance of sentences passed by them. The only justification for establishing such tribunals is necessity during insurrection and emergency. The idea is that, instead of leaving the punishment of offenders to the whim or casual action of the officers acting without consultation and regular procedure, it is better to authorise some tribunals to administer punishment on a somewhat regular basis. Usually, there is a proclamation of a state of martial law. It is not, however, such a proclamation, but the events, which make martial law. Even without such a proclamation, a state of things may exist when the military forces may be employed in executing martial law.32 A proclamation by itself is no conclusive proof of the existence or non-existence of the necessity of invoking martial law. A proclamation can neither change peace-time condition into one of emergency within the country, nor can its absence mean that there is no emergency. A proclamation is merely a notification to the inhabitants that the military commander has assumed control of the area, but it in no way affects the legality or illegality of his action. The main question always is: whether there is in fact a situation of rebellion or insurrection warranting the invocation of martial law, and justifying the use of force to restore law and order. The courts can decide the fact of existence or non-existence of such a situation as a fact. There is no precise test to determine this matter. If, on account of hostilities, the civil courts cease to function for the time being, the maintenance of order passes from the civil to the military hands. But even if courts continue to pursue their ordinary course to some extent, it is not a conclusive proof that martial law situation does not exist. Even when the courts are sitting, they do not exercise any control over the military authorities during the martial law. As stated by the Privy Council in Marais:33 \".... where actual war is raging acts done by the military authorities are not justiciable by the ordinary tribunals...\" The courts can decide whether as a fact a situation exists calling for the use of force. But once the fact of insurrection is recognised by them, they exercise no jurisdiction over the military authorities; their actions are not justiciable during the period of martial law and the courts cannot go into the propriety or otherwise of their Page 155 action.",

As Keir and Lawson observe: \"... there is no doubt that the courts are guided by the feeling that military questions are best left to soldiers and not to Judges, and they are unwilling that the former should be relieved by judicial interference from any of their responsibility. Neither will they do any thing which might be construed into an acknowledgment of the validity of the acts of military authorities.\"34 The military, however, can use only so much force, and no more, as may be necessary to put down breaches of peace. In every case, action taken by the military is to be judged by the test of necessity, viz., whether it was necessary in order to perform its duty of repelling force and restoring order. If the force used is excessive or unnecessary, the military authorities can be held liable for it. Thus, after the cession of the insurrection, when the courts are able to sit again, the acts of the military may be shown to be illegal. The courts can scrutinise the actions of the military authorities after martial law comes to an end. The test for this purpose is whether actions were in excess of what was necessary. A debatable point is whether the test is strict necessity or bona fidebelief in the necessity of the action, and whether it is for the defendant to show that the test had been fulfilled, or for the complainant to show that it had not been complied with. There is no authority on the basis of which these questions can be answered definitively. The theoretical position remains that in exercise of its duty to maintain order, the military authorities act on their own responsibility and that there may be an ex post facto judicial scrutiny of their action. In practice, however, such a scrutiny is avoided by Parliament enacting an Act of Indemnity to protect the military from any legal proceedings in respect of action taken by it during the martial law period.35It has been held in Britain that an Act of Indemnity is no defence where the conduct of a military officer was not bona fide directed to the suppression of the insurrection.36 On the whole, therefore, law affords little protection to persons during the martial law regime. There is no remedy if the courts stop functioning. Even if the courts are operating, they would not scrutinise military action once the need for such action is recognised by them. There may be an ex post facto judicial scrutiny into the military action taken during the martial law period, but this is barred by passage of the Act of Indemnity. However, after cession of martial law, sentences passed by military tribunals come to an end unless they have been sanctioned by legislation. In India, Art. 34 provides that, notwithstanding the guarantee of Fundamental Rights, and the right to move the Supreme Courtfor their enforcement, Parliament may pass a law indemnifying any government servant, or other person, in respect of any act done by him in connection with the maintenance or restoration of order in any area within the territory of India where martial law was in force, or validate any sentence passed, punishment inflicted, or forfeiture ordered, or other act done under martial law in such area. Article 34 thus enables Parliament to enact an Act of Indemnity to protect government and military officers from any liability for action taken by them for restoration of order during the martial law period. Such an Act cannot be questioned on the ground of infringement of Fundamental Rights of a person. Further, under Art. 34, Parliament can extend the immunity to any person other than a government servant as well. The reason for this is that during martial law, it is not only the duty of the military officers but of all citizens to help in maintaining law and order. Therefore, if a citizen does any such act, he should also be indemnified in the same way as government servants. The power of Parliament under Art. 34 is subject to two conditions: (i) the act to be indemnified must have been done in connection with the main-tenance or restoration of order; and (ii) martial law must be in force in the area where the act was done. There is no other provision in the Constitution, besides Art. 34, referring to martial law. Some support for the Page 156 purpose may, however, be sought from such provisions as Art. 355.37 The truth, however, is that there is no need to seek any constitutional or legislative sanction for invoking martial law. The need to preserve the state is its sanction, justification and legitimacy. The argument of 'necessity' has been accepted in the constitutional jurisprudence of Britain and the U.S.A. As soon as the fact of insurrection and rebellion is recognised by the courts, they would cease to exercise any jurisdiction in the troubled spot till the rebellion or insurrection subsides. It is only then that the question will arise whether more force than was necessary was applied to deal with the situation. Art. 34 will take care of this situation. The language of Art. 34 seems to suggest that all the principles of the British Constitutional law concerning martial law would operate in India. Art. 34 envisages that Fundamental Rights have been infringed during the martial law regime. A distinction has to be drawn between martial law and an emergency as envisaged in Art. 352. The two are very different concepts.",

    "content": "34 will take care of this situation. The language of Art. 34 seems to suggest that all the principles of the British Constitutional law concerning martial law would operate in India. Art. 34 envisages that Fundamental Rights have been infringed during the martial law regime. A distinction has to be drawn between martial law and an emergency as envisaged in Art. 352. The two are very different concepts. Martial law is a common law concept, the basis of which is actual rebellion or insurrection; it stems from the necessity to meet force with force. On the other hand, an emergency can be proclaimed only when the security of India, or a part thereof, is threatened by war, external aggression or armed rebellion. In fact, in the emergencies proclaimed so far, there was hardly any breakdown of law and order in the country; the government and the courts continued to function normally and the military was not placed in charge of maintaining law and order any where in the country. Nor had any power been claimed by the government outside the normal law by setting up the plea of martial law. Martial law is a much more restrictive concept than emergency under Art. 352.38 Emergency cannot come into existence without a presidential proclamation to that effect, but, strictly speaking, no proclamation is necessary for enforcement of martial law which depends on the factual existence of insurrection or rebellion, and depends on the right of the state to repel force by force in self-defence. Martial law can come into being only in the actual area of rebellion and not throughout the country, whereas emergency under Art. 352 (at least until the 42nd Constitutional Amendment), came into effect throughout the country, and the Fundamental Rights of the people all over the country could be adversely affected. Under emergency, not merely the function of maintaining law and order but many aspects of government are affected, e.g., federalism, legislative powers and Fundamental Rights. Emergency does not come to an end till formally revoked by the President and a proclamation of emergency needs to be approved by Parliament. It is axiomatic that as soon as martial law situation arises, civil courts' power to interfere with military action automatically comes to an end for the duration of the period of martial law, and during martial law, courts will not enforce Fundamental Rights so as to interfere with discharge of its duties by the military in the actual area of operations. But there is no impact on Federalism, as such, or on the legislative power of the Centre or the States, or on Fundamental Rights of the people outside the troubled spot. Martial law depends upon the factual existence of a state of rebellion, insurrection, etc., while emergency depends upon the 'subjective satisfaction' of the President regarding threat to the security of India by war, external aggression, armed rebellion. Emergency can be declared even when the actual event has not happened but there is imminent danger thereof. Thus, to equate martial law with the emergency under Art. 352 will be tantamount to giving a significance to martial law which it never possesses traditionally in the English common law from where the concept has been borrowed in India. Nor should the constitutional provisions regarding emergency be approached from the coloured vision of martial law concept. The two concepts should the kept separate and distinct although in a situation it may be that both concepts--martial law and emergency--come into operation simultaneously. That is, if a martial law situation arises then, in addition to the military taking over the peace-keeping functions, the Central Government may also decide that an emergency be proclaimed under Art. 352 and Fundamental Rights be suspended under Arts. 358 and 359.39 But, strictly speaking, it is not necessary to take recourse to emergency provisions; the law relating to martial law is adequate enough to cope with the situation. As noted above, in Britain, the courts do not interfere with the functioning of military authorities in the martial Page 157 law area and pari passu the courts in India will not also question any action of the military authorities during martial law on the ground of its contravening a Fundamental Right. The position in Britain is that once the factual situation warranting recourse to martial law is established, the courts will not then intervene with the military operations on any ground and the same position should obtain in India. Although a proclamation is not strictly necessary for enforcing martial law, nevertheless, the President can issue such a proclamation, if he so desires, under Art. 53(2) as the supreme commander of the defence forces.40 But, as seen above, such a proclamation is merely of evidentiary value and is not conclusive of the existence of the situation warranting invocation of martial law. The courts can go into the factum whether or not a rebellion or insurrection was already in existence which necessitated recourse to martial law. It may not be out of place to mention here that an entirely new connotation has been given to the concept of material law in Pakistan and some ex-colonial countries, viz., military overthrowing the legitimate government, establish a military regime and declare martial law in the country. This in substance connotes military rule.41 This has nothing to do with the maintenance of law and order in the country. This type of \"martial law\" is not at all envisaged by Art. 34 which is based on the basic premise that the civilian government including Parliament subsist, for, it is Parliament alone which can pass an Act of Indemnity. In recent days, to fight terrorism and break-down of law and order, Parliament has had to enact some drastic laws conferring broad powers on the military personnel but falling short of martial law.",

    "content": "which is based on the basic premise that the civilian government including Parliament subsist, for, it is Parliament alone which can pass an Act of Indemnity. In recent days, to fight terrorism and break-down of law and order, Parliament has had to enact some drastic laws conferring broad powers on the military personnel but falling short of martial law. The Armed Forces (Assam and Manipur) Special Powers Act, enacted in 1958, conferred special powers on the members of the armed forces in the disturbed areas of Assam, Manipur, Nagaland, Tripura, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh. The Act authorises the civil authorities to call the armed forces to their aid in case of disturbed or dangerous condition and the army officers are given extensive powers to maintain public order. The above Act has been was held to be constitutionally valid by the Delhi High Court in Inderjit Barua v. State of Assam .42 The Act has now been upheld by the Supreme Court in Naga People's Movement of Human Rights v. Union of India .43The Court has ruled that the Act relates to entry 2A in List I and, thus, Parliament is competent to enact the law. The Act has been enacted by Parliament in exercise of its legislative power under Arts. 246 and 248.44The Act has been enacted to confer certain powers on Armed Forces when deployed in aid of civil power to deal with the situation of internal disturbance in a disturbed area. The Act does not authorise the Armed Forces to supplant or act as substitute for civil power in a disturbed area. The Chandigarh Disturbed Areas Act, 1983, was enacted by Parliament to make better provisions for the suppression of disorder and for the restoration and maintenance of public order in disturbed areas in Chandigarh. The Administrator was authorised, by notification in the official gazette, to declare Chandigarh as a disturbed area. Thereafter, police becomes authorised to use force, even to fire, for maintaining public order after giving due warning, even to the extent of causing death of any one contravening law or order. The Armed Forces (Punjab and Chandigarh) Special Powers Act, 1983, authorisesd armed forces to use force, even to the extent of firing and causing death, on any person infringing law and order in the disturbed area. The army officers could arrest without warrant any person committing a cognizable offence and also search any premises, vehicle, etc. The Disturbed Areas (Special Courts) Amendment Act, 1983, empowered the Central Government to declare an area as 'disturbed' area and set up special courts for speedy disposal of cases connected with the disturbances. The Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1985 (TADA), was enacted by Parliament to fight terrorrist activities in the country. The Preamble to the Act stated that it was being enacted to make special provisions for the prevention of, and for coping with, terrorist and disruptive activities. The Act prescribed capital punishment for any terrorist act causing death. Other punishments for such activities ranged from three years to life imprisonment. Provision was made for establishing designated courts for the speedy trial of the offenders and the verdict of such courts could only be challenged in the Supreme Court. Life of the law was restricted to two years. This Act was replaced by another Act in 1987. The Act has now come to an end Page 158 but a new Act Prevention of Terrorist Activities Act (POTA) has been recently enacted by Parliament.45 These laws are no doubt draconian in nature but may perhaps be justified on the ground that they deal with extraordinary situations and may avoid more drastic measures like martial law to deal with such situations. It is usually complained that a good deal of abuse of power takes place under these special laws. The courts however do try to ensure that misuse of power does not take place. For example, in the Naga People's case, the Apex Court laid down certain guidelines for exercising power under the Armed Forces (Assam and Manipur) Special Powers Act, 1958. E. LEGISLATION TO EFFECTUATE CERTAIN FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS Article 35 embodies the following three principles: (1) Art. 35(a)(i) confers on Parliament, and not the State Legislatures, power to make laws with respect to any matter which under Arts. 16(3), 32(3), 33 and 34 may be provided for by law made by Parliament. The matters mentioned herein are: (i) Art. 16(3):46 prescribing residence within a State as qualification for employment in the State; (ii) Art. 32(3): empowering courts other than the Supreme Court and the High Courts to issue writs and orders to enforce Fundamental Rights;47 (iii) Art. 33: providing for abrogation of, or restriction on, Fundamental Rights of members of armed forces and the police in the interests of discipline and efficiency of forces;48 (iv) Art. 34: passing an Act of Indemnity after operation of martial law in any area.49 Each of the provisions mentioned above itself confers a similar power on Parliament. Art 35(a)(i), therefore, does not contain any additional power for Parliament but only states much more explicitly that the State Legislatures are not entitled to pass any such law. (2) Art. 35(a)(ii) confers on Parliament, and not the State Legislatures, power to make laws for prescribing punishments for those acts which are declared offences under the Fundamental Rights. Such matters are: (i) Art. 17: prescribing punishment for enforcement of any disability arising out of untouchability;50 (ii) Art. 23(1): prescribing punishment for traffic in human beings and imposition of begar and other forms of forced labour.51 Powers conferred on Parliament by clauses (a)(i) and (a)(ii) of Art. 35 are \"notwithstanding anything in the Constitution\". Parliament can, therefore, make a law exclusively with respect to any of the matters mentioned above, even though the matter might fall in the sphere of the State Legislatures according to the scheme of distribution of legislative powers.52 Legislative power in this area is given exclusively to Parliament and is specifically denied to the State Legislatures.",

    "content": "are \"notwithstanding anything in the Constitution\". Parliament can, therefore, make a law exclusively with respect to any of the matters mentioned above, even though the matter might fall in the sphere of the State Legislatures according to the scheme of distribution of legislative powers.52 Legislative power in this area is given exclusively to Parliament and is specifically denied to the State Legislatures. The object of this is that Fundamental Rights both as to their nature, and as to the punishment involved in their infringement, may be uniform throughout India. Uniformity can be achieved and maintained only when the power is exercised by Parliament and not by State Legislatures.53 Accordingly, Parliament has enacted several laws to effectuate several Fundamental Rights. For example, to implement the principles underlying Art. 23(1), Parliament has enacted the Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Girls Act, 1956, with the object of inhibiting or abolishing the immoral traffic in women and girls. (3) Art. 35(b) lays down that any law existing on the date of the commencement of the Constitution and dealing with any of the matters mentioned in Arts. 35(a)(i) and (ii), as mentioned above, is to remain in force (even though made by a State Legislature) until altered, repealed or abrogated by Parliament. F. EMERGENCY AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS Emergency has a debilitating effect on the rights of the people in a democratic country. For example, in the Page 159 U.S.A., which has constitutionally guaranteed Fundamental Rights comparable to those in India, the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus can be suspended when in case of rebellion or invasion, public interest requires it.54 The courts can, however, determine whether conditions have arisen to justify the suspension of habeas corpus. No other Fundamental Right can be suspended in the U.S.A., but during an emergency, courts do give somewhat restrictive interpretation to these rights than they do during the normal days.55 In Britain, during the two world wars, drastic discretionary powers were conferred on the Executive to interfere with the rights of property and person of the people. This drastic interference with people's rights received judicial sanction in several cases. The theory is that when the country is engaged in a war of survival, the people have to sacrifice their rights to some extent so that the state may live. If the state goes down, the people also go down.56 In India, a proclamation of emergency under Art. 352 affects the Fundamental Rights of the people very drastically.57 The impact of emergency on the Fundamental Rights is much more pervasive in India than is the case in the U.S.A. This topic may be discussed here under the following several heads. SUSPENSION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS (i) POSITION BEFORE 1978 (a) SUSPENSION OF ART. 19 According to Art. 358, as it existed prior to the year 1978, as soon as a proclamation of emergency was made under Art. 352, Art. 19 was suspended.58 Art. 358 stated that while a proclamation of emergency \"is in operation, nothing in Art. 19 shall restrict the power of the State....to make any law or to take any executive action....\" Under Art. 358, there was an automatic suspension of Art. 19, as soon as an emergency was declared under Art. 352. Suspension of Art. 19 during the pendency of the proclamation of emergency under Art. 352, removed the fetters on the legislative and executive powers imposed by Art. 19. If the Legislature made a law or the executive committed acts which were inconsistent with the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Art. 19, their validity was not open to challenge either during the continuance of the emergency, or even thereafter. As soon as the proclamation ceased to operate, the legislative enactments passed, and the executive actions taken, during the course of the said emergency became inoperative to the extent to which they conflicted with the rights guaranteed under Art. 19 because as soon as the emergency was lifted, Art. 19 which was suspended during the emergency was automatically revived and began to operate. Article 358 made it clear that things done or omitted to be done during the emergency could not be challenged even after the emergency was over. In other words, the suspension of Art. 19 was complete during the period in question and legislative and executive action which contravened Art. 19 could not be questioned even after the emergency was over.59 (b) SUSPENSION OF OTHER FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS Article 359 refers to the suspension of the operation of all Fundamental Rights other than Art. 19 during an emergency proclaimed under Art. 352. Under Art. 359, Fundamental Rights as such are not suspended; what is suspended is their enforcement. Under Art. 359, as it stood prior to 1978, the enforcement of all Fundamental Rights (other than Art. 19 which is the subject-matter of Art. 358), could be suspended during an emergency by an executive order. When a proclamation of emergency was in operation, the President could by an order declare that the right to move any Court for the enforcement of any Fundamental Right, and all proceedings pending in any Court for the enforcement of that right, \"shall remain suspended for the period during which the proclamation is in force or for such shorter period as may be specified in the order.\" Page 160 When the emergency was proclaimed on October 26, 1962, under Art. 352(1), in the wake of a conflict between China and India, the President issued an order [PO] under Art. 359, on November 3, 1962, suspending the right to move any Court to enforce Arts. 14, 21 and 22 of the Constitution, if a person was deprived of any such right under the Defence of India Act, 1962, or any rule or order made thereunder. In Mohd. Yaqub v. State of Jammu and Kashmir, 60 an attempt was made to have the Presidential Order declared unconstitutional.",

    "content": "on November 3, 1962, suspending the right to move any Court to enforce Arts. 14, 21 and 22 of the Constitution, if a person was deprived of any such right under the Defence of India Act, 1962, or any rule or order made thereunder. In Mohd. Yaqub v. State of Jammu and Kashmir, 60 an attempt was made to have the Presidential Order declared unconstitutional. The case was concerned with habeas corpus petitions to question the validity of arrests made under Rule 30(1) of the Defence of India Rules, 1962. An effort was also made to challenge the PO issued under Art. 359 suspending Arts. 14, 21 and 22. The line of attack was that the President being an 'authority' under Art. 12, came within the definition of the term 'state';61 the Presidential Order issued under Art. 359 was 'law' within the meaning of Art. 13(2)';62 and, consequently, the Presidential Order was liable to be tested with respect to the Fundamental Rights which it sought to suspend. The argument in the Yaqub case was undoubtedly suggested by the majority decision in Golaknath.63 The Supreme Court rejected the argument holding that Art. 359 gave categorical and unlimited powers to the President to suspend the enforcement of any Fundamental Right during the period of emergency, and, therefore, once the enforcement of a Fundamental Right was suspended, the validity of the Presidential Order could not be tested under that very Fundamental Right which was sought to be suspended. The Court emphasized that Arts. 13(2) and 359 must be read harmoniously so that the intention behind Art. 359 was carried out without being destroyed by Art. 13(2). During the emergency, after a Presidential Order was issued under Art. 359, a law or executive action could still be challenged on any ground other than those covered by Art. 358, or the Presidential Order issued under Art. 359(1). Such a challenge fell outside the purview of the Presidential Order. Thus, it was ruled that a person would not be deprived of his right to move a Court for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that the order for his detention was mala fide. The citizen could also challenge his detention on the ground that any ground mentioned in the order of detention was irrelevant.64 On June 25, 1975, emergency was declared in India on the ground of internal disturbance threatening security of India. Under Art. 359, a Presidential Order was issued on June 27, 1975, suspending enforcement, inter alia, of Art. 14.65 A number of very crucial questions pertaining to Art. 359 arose during this emergency period. The question arose whether Art. 16 was also suspended although it was not mentioned in the order. It could be argued that Art. 16 was only an incident of the concept of equality contained in Art. 14, and, therefore, when Art. 14 was mentioned in the Presidential Order, it also affected Art. 16 without being specifically mentioned therein.66 The Assam High Court took such a view.67 On the other hand, the Rajasthan High Court held that Art. 16 remained operative even though the enforcement of Art. 14 was suspended. The Court emphasized that under Art. 359, the enforcement of only such Fundamental Rights was suspended as were specifically and expressly mentioned in the Presidential Order, and, therefore, suspension of enforcement of Art. 14 would not include Art. 16 as well.68 There is much to be said for the Rajasthan view as it sought to preserve such of the Fundamental Rights as were not specifically mentioned in the Presidential order. There is no reason why the Presidential Order should be given an extended interpretation. After all, suspension of the enforcement of a Fundamental Right is a serious matter and the courts must ensure that, to the extent possible, Fundamental Rights are preserved and not annihilated even during the emergency period. There was no difficulty in the way of the executive to mention Art. 16 as well in the PO if it desired to suspend enforcement of that right as well. A notice was issued to the petitioner under the Income-tax Act on June 14, 1973. A writ petition was filed under Art. 226 to challenge the provision in the Act (under which the notice was issued) as ultra vires Art. 14. The High Court issued an interim injunction restraining the government from enforcing the said order pending a final decision of the point in issue. In the meantime, enforcement of Art. 14 was suspended through a Presidential Order. The Calcutta High Court held that since Art. 14 could not be enforced, the whole proceeding would remain suspended so long as the emergency lasted, and the interim injunction would remain in force till then as the Court could not now examine the validity or propriety of the said order under Page 161 Art. 14.69 The Presidential Order also created difficulties for persons involved in common litigation unconnected with emergency in any way. In a case for ejectment of a tenant from certain premises, the defendant had raised the plea of uncostitutionality of the relevant law under Art. 14. After the Presidential Order suspending enforcement of Art. 14 was issued, the question arose whether the whole proceeding should remain suspended during the emergency period, or whether the case should proceed sans the plea based on Art. 14. The Jammu and Kashmir High Court ruled by majority that the case should proceed but the plea based on Art. 14 could not be entertained by the Court.70 The words 'any Court' in Art. 359 mean any Court of competent jurisdiction including the High Courts and the Supreme Court.",

    "content": "could not be entertained by the Court.70 The words 'any Court' in Art. 359 mean any Court of competent jurisdiction including the High Courts and the Supreme Court. The words \"the right to move any Court for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights\" are broad enough \"to include all claims made by citizens in any Court when it is shown that the said claims cannot be effectively adjudicated upon without examining the question as to whether the petitioner was in substance seeking to enforce any of the specified Fundamental Rights.71 The Presidential Order issued under Art. 359 in 1962, as noted above, suspended enforcement of Art. 14, 21 and 22 for purposes of the \"Defence of India Act and the rules made thereunder.\"72The courts interpreted this order to mean that the jurisdiction of the courts was excluded to entertain a petition for impairment of Arts. 14, 21 or 22 only when the order sought to be impugned was made under the authority of the \" Defence of India Act or the rules made thereunder,\" but not otherwise. If an executive action was taken under any law other than the Defence of India Act, or the rules or orders made thereunder, then it could be challenged under Arts. 14, 21 and 22.73 This question is further considered below in connection with preventive detention under the emergency.74 In Makhan Singh,75 the Supreme Court had an occasion to consider the effect of the proclamation of emergency and the Presidential Order issued thereunder. While distinguishing between Arts. 358 and 359, the Court pointed out that, unlike Art. 358, under which the right itself was suspended, the Presidential Order under Art. 359 \"cannot widen the authority of the legislatures or the executive; it merely suspends the right to move any Court to obtain relief on the ground that the Fundamental Rights have been contravened if the said rights are specified in the Order.\" The inevitable consequence of this, according to the Court, was that \"as soon as the Order ceases to be operative, the infringement of the rights made either by the legislative enactment or by executive action can perhaps be challenged by a citizen in a Court of law and the same may have to be tried on merits on the basis that the rights alleged to have been infringed were in operation even during the pendency of the Presidential Order.\" Further, that \"if at the expiration of the President's Order, Parliament passes any legislation to protect executive action taken during the pendency of the Presidential Order and afford indemnity to the executive in that behalf, the validity and the effect of such legislation may have to be carefully scrutinised.\" Thus, in effect, what the Supreme Court stated in Makhan Singh was that when the emergency came to an end, those persons who had been denied enforcement of their Fundamental Rights because of Art. 359 and the Presidential Order thereunder, could sue the government for damages on the ground that not their rights, but only their enforcement, had been suspended during the emergency. This theoretically created a problem for the government in so far as the government could be sued for damages after the emergency by those whose rights were violated during the emergency. This situation could be met by Parliament by passing an Act of Indemnity to indemnify the executive for acts done by it during the emergency. But Parliament's power to do so was open to grave doubt. Art. 34 authorises Parliament to pass an Act of Indemnity after the imposition of the Martial Law. It is doubtful whether Art. 34 could be stretched to cover an emergency under Art. 352 as well.76 The two situations appear to be distinct and the better view will be that Art. 34 is confined to the Martial Law situation and does not extend to the emergency situation.77 This difficulty was got over by amending Art. 359 by the 38th Amendment in 1975 and adding Cl. 359(1A) Page 162 which reads as follows: \"While an order made under Cl. (1) mentioning any of the [Fundamental Rights] is in operation, nothing in [Fundamental Rights] shall restrict the power of the State.... to make any laws or to take any executive action which the State would but for the provisions contained in the [Fundamental Rights] be competent to make or to take, but any law so made shall to the extent of the incompetency, cease to have effect as soon as the order aforesaid ceases to operate, except as respects things done or omitted to be done before the law so ceases to have effect.\" This clause was added with retrospective effect from the date of the Constitution. The idea of the provision was to bring Art. 359(1) at par with Art. 358(1). Cl. 359(1A) was put in with a view to bring the effect of the Presidential Order under Art. 359(1) on par with Art. 358(1) insofar as the competence of the state to make a law inconsistent with the specified Fundamental Rights was concerned. The language of Art. 359(1) was broadly similar to that of Art. 358(1). (c) PREVENTIVE DETENTION AND EMERGENCY BEFORE 1975 A critical question which emerged during the emergencies of 1962 and 1971 was with respect to the scope of judicial review of preventive detention. When emergency was declared in 1962, enforcement of Arts. 14, 21 and 22 was suspended by the Presidential Order (PO) issued under Art. 359 as regards a person who was deprived of these rights under the Defence of India Act, or any rule or order made thereunder. Parliament then enacted the Defence of India Act, 1962, with a view to arm the Central Governmentwith extraordinary powers to deal with the emergency situation. S.3 of the Act authorised the government to make rules for securing the defence of India, civil defence, public safety, maintenance of public order and related matters.",

    "content": "30(i)(b) of the Defence of India Rules, 1962, made under the Act, authorised the Central or State Government to detain a person if it was satisfied that it was necessary to do so with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the defence of India, civil defence, public safety, maintenance of public order, India's relations with foreign powers, maintenance of peaceful conditions in any part of India, efficient conduct of military operations, or maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community. Rule 30A set up a machinery for confirming and reviewing detention orders. The order of detention passed by an authorised officer was to be reviewed by a reviewing authority of two officials, and the order was then to be confirmed or cancelled by the government concerned. Further, each case of detention was to be reviewed regularly at a six monthly interval and the order of detention confirmed or cancelled by the government concerned. Rule 30(i)(b) thus made more drastic provisions regarding preventive detention than the Preventive Detention Act, as the rule made no provision for communicating grounds of detention to the detainee, or for making any representation by him at any stage; the rule fixed no maximum period of detention and review by the advisory board was done away with and, in its place, review by an official body was substituted. A similar situation developed when emergency was declared in 1971. In Makhan Singh v. State of Punjab, 78 a case which arose under the proclamation of emergency issued in 1962, the Supreme Court was called upon to consider the question whether any judicial review of detention under Rule 30(i)(b) was at all possible. A detainee challenged his detention as illegal and improper before the Punjab High Court under S. 491(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code. This section providedinter alia that \"any High Court may whenever it thinks fit direct that a person illegally, or improperly detained in public custody be set at liberty.\" After the inauguration of the Constitution, S. 491 fell into deseutude because more efficacious remedies by way of Arts. 32 and 226 had come into vogue. S. 491 was now sought to be resurrected in Makhan Singh because enforcement of Art. 21 under Art. 32 was suspended. The main arguments of the petitioner were-- Page 163 (a) Although enforcement of Arts. 21 and 22 was suspended, these rights still subsisted and Rule 30(i)(b) was bad as it infringed these Articles; (b) What Art. 359 barred was enforcement of Arts. 21 and 22 through constitutional remedies under Arts. 32 and 226, but not under S. 491 , Cr.P.C. Rejecting these contentions, the Supreme Courtruled by majority that no action could lie under S. 491 , Cr.P.C., to enforce Arts. 21 and 22. Art. 359 barred the right to move 'any Court' to enforce these Fundamental Rights, and the words 'any Court' included theSupreme Courtas well as the High Courts, and, therefore, none of these courts could be moved for the purpose either under Arts. 32 or 226 or under S. 491 , Cr.P.C. No action to enforce Arts. 21 and 22 could now lie. TheSupreme Court, however, emphasized that judicial review on grounds other than the Fundamental Rights included in the PO was not barred, as Art. 359 only authorised suspension of the Fundamental Rights specified in the PO. A detenu could thus challenge his detention on such grounds as violation of the mandatory provisions of the detention law, or where the detention had been ordered mala fide, etc., as such pleas fell outside the purview of Art. 359 and, consequently, of the PO issued under Art. 359. Also, if a detenu contended that provisions of the Defence of India Act under which he was detained suffered from the vice of excessive delegation,79 such a plea could not be rejected at the threshold because it was not relatable to any Fundamental Right suspended by the PO. Also, a detenu could challenge an order of detention if it was made by an officer outside the authority conferred on him by the government. Defence of India Rule 30(i)(b) was of a very drastic nature and the courts were conscious of the possibility that uncontrolled administrative powers could be misused or abused. Although a detainee could not now challenge his detention on the basis of infringement of Art. 14, 21 or 22, yet, in subsequent cases, the Supreme Courtpermitted petitions to be filed under Rule 30(i)(b) on the ground that since the PO had suspended the enforcement of Arts. 14, 21 and 22 only in the context of the Defence of India Act, or rules or order made thereunder, a detention order not made in accordance with the Defence of India Rule in question was not under it and, thus, the PO did not bar remedy under Art. 32 to challenge the same. The PO could not bar a plea of the detention order being mala fide because such a plea was not relatable to the Fundamental Rights specified in the said PO. Similarly, a challenge to the Defence of India Act on the ground of excessive delegation could not be barred. Accordingly, the Supreme Courtentertained a writ petition under Art. 32 to challenge the Defence of India Act on the ground of excessive delegation, or to challenge Rule 30(i)(b) on the ground that it exceeded the rule-making power conferred by the Act, but the plea was rejected.80 The Supreme Courtalso ruled that the PO was conditional as its operation was limited to the Defence of India Act, or the Rules made thereunder. When a person was deprived of his personal liberty in contravention of the Defence of India Act, or the Rules, his right to move the Supreme Court or the High Court was not suspended.",

    "content": "a person was deprived of his personal liberty in contravention of the Defence of India Act, or the Rules, his right to move the Supreme Court or the High Court was not suspended. The case in point is State of Maharashtra v. Prabhakar .81 The petitioner who was detained under Rule 30(1) of the Defence of India Rules, 1962, wrote a scientific book, but the State Government denied him permission to send the manuscript for publication. When the matter came before the Supreme Court, it ruled that the State Government had acted contrary to the law in refusing permission for publication of the manuscript. The Court explained that the PO suspended Art. 21 during the emergency period only to the extent that a person was deprived of his personal liberty under the Defence of India Act or the Rules. If the authority concerned imposed a restriction in violation of the law under which he was detained, he would be entitled to move the High Court or the Supreme Court. The result of the above judicial approach was that preventive detention under Rule 30(i)(b) became challengeable on all those grounds on which a discretionary decision can be challenged on the basis of the principles of Administrative Law.82 In this way, the courts succeeded in imposing a limited judicial review on the vast emergency administrative power to order preventive detention during an emergency. Thus, while the courts did maintain that the question of detaining a person was one of subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority, and hence not justiciable,83 an order of preventive detention could be quashed on such grounds as non-conformity with law,84mala fides,85 non-application of mind by the detaining authority to the materials Page 164 placed before it,86 taking into account irrelevant considerations by the detaining authority in issuing a detention order,87 or the detention order being based on illusory grounds,88 or lack of competence in the detaining authority to make a detention order because of some defect in his authority to do so.89 The Courts repeatedly emphasized that in a situation where a person could be deprived of his liberty simply by the issue of an administrative order, strict compliance with the letter of the law was necessary, and any deviation from the law in question would vitiate the order. A few examples of the judicial process in the area may be noted below: (i) Rule 30(i)(b) authorised preventive detention for 'maintenance of public order'. Therefore, detention for 'maintenance of law and order' fell outside the scope of the Rule and so was invalid because the concept of 'law and order' was broader than that of 'public order'.90 (ii) A detention order mentioned verbatim six out of the seven grounds mentioned in Rule 30(i)(b). When it was challenged, the Minister asserted in an affidavit that he was personally satisfied that the detention was necessary in order to prevent the detenu from acting against the safety of India and maintenance of public order. The affidavit made no reference to the four other grounds mentioned in the detention order. The Supreme Court quashed the detention order holding that the detaining authority had not applied its mind properly before passing the order. The Court emphasized that the authority had to be satisfied with respect to each of the grounds mentioned in the order.91 Rule 30A envisaged a six monthly review of a detention order.92 The Supreme Court laid down the following few propositions concerning this rule: (1) An order confirming detention after such review should be recorded in writing. If that was not done, there was failure to comply with the rule and the detention became invalid.93 (2) If a review was done after more than six months, Rule 30A was infringed and, therefore, the detention became invalid.94 (3) While the original order detaining a person under Rule 30(i)(b) was administrative in nature, the review under Rule 30A was a quasi-judicial proceeding.95 The practical implications of this ruling were that while under the rule, a detainee had no right to get the grounds of his detention and make representation against it, he got such a right under Rule 30A at the time of the review. Through these various rulings, the Supreme Court made a significant contribution towards mitigating somewhat the rigours of the emergency preventive detention. The Court sought to draw a balance between the interests of the country and individual liberty during an emergency. (c) PREVENTIVE DETENTION AND THE EMERGENCY OF 1975 When emergency was declared on June 25, 1975, under Art. 352, on the ground of internal disturbance, a Presidential Order [PO] was issued on June 27, 1975, under Art. 359 suspending the right of access to the courts for the enforcement of rights of any person under Arts. 14, 21 and 22 generally.1 The PO of 1975 was at variance with the Presidential Orders issued in 1962 or 1971 which had done so only for purposes of the Defence of India Act and the Rules thereunder. On January 8, 1976, another Presidential Order was issued suspending the enforcement of Art. 19. The Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA)2, was amended by Parliament to put into effect a more drastic version of preventive detention. The highlights of these amendments were as follows: (a) The Central or State Government, or the authorised officer could make a declaration, along with the order of preventive detention issued under MISA, that the detention of that specified individual was \"necessary for dealing effectively with the emergency\"; (b) Such a declaration meant that the certain safeguards which were available ordinarily under MISA to a detainee were not to be available to the specified individual. Thus, (i) the grounds of Page 165 his detention were not to be communicated to him; (ii) his case was not to be reviewed by the advisory board as envisaged in Art.",

    "content": "(i) the grounds of Page 165 his detention were not to be communicated to him; (ii) his case was not to be reviewed by the advisory board as envisaged in Art. 22 of the Constitution; and (iii) he was not to have a right of making a representation; (c) The only safeguard was executive or administrative review of the exercise of the power of detention. This meant that-- (i) The declaration made by the authorised official as to the 'necessity of detention' of an individual, was to be reviewed by the concerned government within 15 days; (ii) If the government failed to confirm the said declaration within this period, it was to cease to be effective; (iii) The detention of such a person was to be reconsidered by the appropriate government every four months; (iv) If it appeared to the government concerned that the detention of the person concerned was not necessary for 'effectively dealing' with the emergency, the declaration could be revoked in which case the normal safeguards of MISA could operate; (v) The State Government was to report the making of the detention order to the Central Government; and (vi) The Central Government could require the State Government to furnish to it the grounds on which the order was made and other particulars having a bearing on the necessity of the order. (d) It was now specifically provided that no detainee was to \"have any right to personal liberty by virtue of natural law or common law, if any.\" (e) Also, the modified provisions of MISA were to be applicable notwithstanding anything in MISAor rules of natural justice; (f) The government could act under MISA on the basis of information in its possession without disclosing the facts or giving an opportunity of making a representation to the person concerned; (g) It was now provided that the revocation of a detention order was not to bar the making of another detention order under the Act against the same person; (h) A new provisions s. 16A, was added to MISA in January 1976. Saying that the grounds of detention and the information and materials on which the grounds were based against any person shall be treated as confidential and shall be deemed to refer to matters of state and to be against the public interest to disclose,\" and no one was to communicate or disclose any such ground; nor could the detainee claim communication or disclosure of any such ground or the production to him of any document containing any such ground. The government was thus vested with extraordinary power to detain persons without trial. The provisions of the amended MISA covering emergency detention were extremely drastic. India had never before witnessed such a rigorous version of preventive detention. A stone-wall was sought to be created around the grounds of detention. Only the Administration was to have knowledge of the grounds, and none else, not even the detainee. The provisions were so drafted as to exclude judicial review of any case of emergency detention. The only safeguard was the self-discipline of the government or the officers having the power to detain people, the review by the government of the exercise of the power by its officers, and four monthly review by the government of each case of detention, and, ultimately, control by the Central Government. The most crucial question which was raised in this connection was regarding the scope of judicial review of a detention order issued under the above provisions of MISA. Was it possible to challenge an order of preventive detention on the ground that it was inconsistent with the provisions of MISA, or that it was mala fide. A number of writ petitions were moved in various High Courts under Art. 226 challenging preventive detention orders as being not in compliance with law. In some of these cases, the High Courts did hold that an order of preventive detention was reviewable on some limited grounds. To take one of these cases, K.M. Ghatage v. Union of India3 as an example, the petitioners argued, inter alia: (i) Personal liberty was a common law right existing on the eve of the Constitution and, therefore, Page 166 even though Art. 21 granted the right of personal liberty, the common law right was not absorbed into Art. 21. Accordingly, when Art. 21 was suspended, the common law right was revived; (ii) Such pleas as mala fides, or preventive detention order being ultra vires the MISA could be entertained by the Court because these pleas were based on the basic principle that a public authority could not act beyond its statutory power and these pleas did not amount to enforcement of Art. 21; (iii) These pleas fell outside Art. 359; (iv) The earlier cases under the Defence of India Rules were based not only on the limited scope of the Presidential Order but also on the premise that certain pleas, like mala fides, etc., fell outside the scope of Art. 359 and could not thus be suspended by the PO. The Central Governmentopposing these petitions argued that the PO of June was omnibus and unconditional, unlike the earlier POs of 1962, and 1971, which were conditional and confined only to the Defence of India Act and the Rules made thereunder. The PO of 1975 granted a blanket protection to the executive in matters of preventive detention. Because of the width of the present PO, the earlier cases on judicial review of preventive detention under the Defence of India Rules were not relevant. Art. 21 was suspended for all purposes and there was no right of personal liberty de hors Art. 21. In Ghatage, the Bombay High Court overruled the government contentions and substantially agreed with the petitioners. Referring to the line of cases beginning with Makhan Singh, the High Court held that the pleas of mala fide etc. had been regarded as falling outside the scope of Art. 359.",

    "content": "21 was suspended for all purposes and there was no right of personal liberty de hors Art. 21. In Ghatage, the Bombay High Court overruled the government contentions and substantially agreed with the petitioners. Referring to the line of cases beginning with Makhan Singh, the High Court held that the pleas of mala fide etc. had been regarded as falling outside the scope of Art. 359. Such pleas could not be affected, nor be brought within the scope of Art. 359, by any PO whatever its width. No PO however comprehensive could affect a challenge to preventive detention on a ground falling outside Art. 359. The High Court emphasized that the President cannot merely by issuing an order under Art. 359 convert a lawless action into a lawful one. Even during an emergency, an executive action must be supported by law and its validity must be tested with reference to the law under which it was purported to be taken and absolute immunity cannot be claimed for an order not supported by law. A PO cannot give a blanket power to the executive to act without any authority of law. Under Art. 358 itself, ultra vires executive action has been held to be not protected.4 On this view of the matter, the High Court did not go into the broader question whether the concept of personal liberty was solely based in Art. 21 or existed outside Art. 21 in common law. However, although theoretically the judicial review of preventive detention under MISA was thus possible on some grounds, it would be extremely difficult for the petitioner to substantiate the plea of mala fides as he was not entitled to receive the grounds of detention, or the details of any materials on the basis of which subjective satisfaction to detain him was arrived at. On merits, the petitions were dismissed by the High Court as the petitioners failed to establish a prima facie case of mala fides against the detaining authority, and the provisions of MISA had been complied with. The Court conceded the fact that, as a result of the amendments in the MISA, \"the area and depth of probe is further conditioned and minimised\".5 In A.D.M., Jabalpur v. S. Shukla, 6 by a majority of 4 to 1 (Khanna, J., dissenting), the Supreme Court overruled the views expressed by the various High Courts, as mentioned above, and held that in view of the PO of 1975, no person had any locus standi to move any petition before a High Court under Art. 226 for a writ of habeas corpus, or any other writ, to challenge the legality of a detention order on any ground whatsoever, e.g., it was not under, or, in compliance with the Act, or was illegal, or was vitiated by mala fides, factual or legal, or was based on extraneous considerations. The majority advanced mainly the following arguments for this view: (1) Art. 21 was the 'sole repository' of the rights to life and personal liberty against the State. Any claim to a writ of habeas corpus to challenge detention on any ground amounted to enforcement of the right of personal liberty under Art. 21, the enforcement of which had been suspended by the PO under Art. 359. (2) Art. 21 contained the words 'procedure established by law'. So, when a person complained that his detention was not in accordance with MISA, he was in substance complaining of Page 167 violation of Art. 21 which he could not do in view of the PO. (3) The PO of 1975 was unconditional and much broader in scope than the PO issued in 1962 which was conditional and was confined only to the Defence of India Act or the Rules made thereunder. Therefore, the cases under the earlier emergency of preventive detention were not relevant under the PO of 1975. The majority, however, emphasized that the suspension of Art. 21 did not affect the general rule that the executive could not detain a person otherwise than under a law, but, nevertheless, it also maintained that the PO barred the right to complain of any deviation, howsoever substantial it might be, from that rule and the detainee had no remedy in case his detention contravened the law under which it was issued. In substance, it meant that even if an order was not in conformity with MISA, it could not be challenged. This meant that a person could be put in prison with impunity without his getting any relief whatsoever. Lastly, the drastic provision contained in S. 16A(9) of MISA throwing a wall of confidentiality around the grounds of detention, which was challenged on the ground of encroachment upon the jurisdiction of the High Courts under Art. 226, was upheld by the majority on the ground that it was a rule of evidence. Distinguishing the present situation with that in Gopalan where S. 14 of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950, was held bad, the majority stated that in Gopalan, the detainee could question a detention order on several grounds and since S. 14 debarred the Court from doing so, it was ultra vires,7 In the instant case, the PO deprived the respondents of their very locus standi to file a writ petition and, therefore, S. 16A(9) could not be said to shut out an inquiry which was otherwise within the jurisdiction of the High Court to make. Thus, the Shukla case made the emergency of 1975 most draconian of all the emergencies imposed so for under Art. 352 so far as the people of India were concerned. The Shukla ruling was startling, to say the least, and struck at the very foundations of Rule of Law and the Administrative Law in India. It has been laid down judicially that the executive must keep to law, even during an emergency, in relation to Art. 358.8 At the time, the language of both Arts.",

    "content": "so far as the people of India were concerned. The Shukla ruling was startling, to say the least, and struck at the very foundations of Rule of Law and the Administrative Law in India. It has been laid down judicially that the executive must keep to law, even during an emergency, in relation to Art. 358.8 At the time, the language of both Arts. 358 and 359 was convergent and it was, therefore, hard to appreciate as to why the administrative power of detention should be freed from the shackles of statutory limitations. In fact, the scope of Art. 359 was somewhat restrictive as compared to that of Art. 358 because while under Art. 358, the Fundamental Right itself was suspended, under Art. 359, it was only the enforcement of the Fundamental Right, and not the right itself, which was suspended. Therefore, if under Art. 358, administrative power had to follow the law, then there was no valid reason as to why administrative power should not follow the law under Art. 359. The Court tried to distinguish the position under the 1975 emergency from that of 1962 on the basis of the scope of the PO issued under Art. 359. But this argument does not appear to be much relevant. It is true that in many cases subsequent to Makhan Singh, the view was propounded that the PO being conditional and limited to the Defence of India Rules, it did not debar a person to come before the Court to challenge his detention if it was in contravention of the relevant rules. But this view was adopted to permit the petitions being moved by the detenus under Art. 32.9 The root case in this respect, however, is Makhan Singh and there the Court stated more than once that the pleas of mala fides, etc., fell outside Art. 359 and were independent of the phraseology of the PO as no PO issued under Art. 359 could affect them. From this view of the matter, the phraseology of the PO of 1975 really becomes irrelevant. The only effect of the general suspension of Art. 21 ought to have been that while a detenu could not come before the Supreme Court under Art. 32 as he had no right to personal liberty, he could go to the High Court under Art. 226 as he was challenging the exercise of administrative power by invoking the principles of Administrative Law. It is at the basis of the Indian jurisprudence that if the executive derives powers under a statute, then it is subject to the doctrine of ultra vires. This principle has been applied in all kinds of situations to protect various kinds of rights whether fundamental or otherwise.10This is the foundational norm of the constitutional system in India. This norm is not derivable from any Fundamental Right. Therefore, even if the right to personal liberty cannot be claimed outside Art. 21, the norm that the executive must act within the confines of the law should still remain operative as it is not dependent on Art. 21. It is inconceivable that this norm should operate in all areas during an emergency except in the matter of personal liberty. To challenge an Page 168 order of detention on the basis of ultra vires is not an enforcement of the right to personal liberty but of the basic general norm that the executive must act within the bounds of law. Even if habeas corpus was not issuable because of suspension of Art. 21, there still was mandamus which could be issued to quash an ultra vires exercise of power by the Administration. When the executive acts under a law, and the majority did concede that even after suspension of Art. 21, there must be a law to authorise the executive to issue orders of preventive detention, then the doctrine of ultra vires must apply in all its ramifications. The pleas of mala fides, irrelevant considerations, etc., are merely pleas of ultra vires.11 Actually, as a result of Shukla, Art. 21 became more of a liability rather than an asset and during an emergency, perhaps, the position of the individual could be better off if Art. 21 were not there. In a normal situation, Art. 21 at that time (before Maneka) afforded no protection against legislative action.12 It was a safeguard only against administrative action but it gave no additional safeguard than what would otherwise be available under the general principles of Administrative Law. If Art. 21 were not there in the Constitution, then the PO under Art. 359 could not have suspended it and the principle of ultra vires would have been operative in the area of personal liberty as in other areas. Art. 21 became a peculiar example of a Fundamental Right working against the very individual for whose protection it was incorporated in the Constitution. It needs to be noted that Khanna, J., in his dissenting opinion in Shukla, stressed that the PO could not immunize an order from an attack on the ground of mala fides, etc., because: \".... a Presidential Order under Article 359(1) cannot have the effect of suspending the right to enforce rights flowing from statutes, nor can it bar access to the Courts of persons seeking redress on the score of contravention of statutory provisions. Statutory provisions are enacted to be complied with and it is not permissible to contravene them. Statutory provisions cannot be treated as mere pious exhortations or words of advice which may be abjured or disobeyed with impunity....\"13 He thus opined that a PO under Art. 359 could suspend enforcement of Fundamental Right but not of statutory rights and a redress sought from a Court on the ground of breach of statutory provisions should remain outside the purview of Art. 359(1) and the PO made thereunder. Only in this way, could a balance be drawn between the exigencies of state action during the emergency and the individual liberty and the rule of law.",

Only in this way, could a balance be drawn between the exigencies of state action during the emergency and the individual liberty and the rule of law. It may be noted that the provisions of the MISA were such that judicial redress would be very difficult to secure even if the doctrine of ultra vires were held to be operative. Khanna, J., maintained that even in the absence of Art. 21, the State has no power to deprive a person of his life or liberty without the authority of law. \"This is the essential postulate and basic assumption of the rule of law and not of men in all civilized nations. Without such sanctity of life and liberty, the distinction between a lawless society and one governed by laws would cease to have any meaning.\" Accordingly, Khanna, J., could not subscribe to the view that when right to enforce the right under Art. 21 was suspended, the result would be that there would be no remedy against deprivation of a person's life or liberty by the state even though such deprivation was without the authority of law, or even in flagrant violation of the provisions of law. Khanna, J. stated: \"The right not to be deprived of one's life or liberty without the authority of law was not the creation of the Constitution. Such right existed before the Constitution came into force.14 It was urged in Shukla15 that Art. 359 should be so interpreted as to provide also for situations in which martial law may have to be declared in any part of India. This argument was not accepted by Beg, J., who held that Art. 359 was wider in scope than martial law which was a very localised matter. He also stated that during martial law, military courts may take over even trial of offences, but such a taking over of jurisdiction by military courts cannot be sanctioned under, and has to be outside, Art. 359.16 On the other hand, Bhagwati, J., accepted the argument and gave a much broader meaning to Art. 359, as he thought that declaration of martial law will have to be backed by a presidential order under Art. 359 and it is only then that the courts can be prevented from exercising power to issue habeas corpus or otherwise Page 169 examining the legality of the action of military authorities.17 This view of Bhagwati, J., raises a host of problems. It means that, as soon as need is felt to enforce martial law in any area, an emergency has also to be declared under Art. 352, for without doing so, Art. 359 cannot be activated. Not only that, a mere presidential order under Art. 359 by itself will not serve the purpose. Parliament will have to pass a law to authorise action by military authorities to interfere with the life and personal liberty of the people. This emerges from the majority opinions in the Shukla case, including that of Bhagwati, J., where it has been stated that suspension of enforcement of Art. 21 does not do away with the need to pass a law to authorise actions by authorities to interfere with the life and personal liberty of the people. This is the very antithesis of martial law for martial law needs no legislative sanction for military action. The fact of the matter is that, as explained above,18 the two concepts, martial law and emergency should be kept distinct and not mixed up with each other, and there is no need to give latitudinarian interpretation either to Art. 34 so as to cover emergency situations, or to Art. 359 so as to cover martial law. The very fact that Art. 34 provides for passing an Act of Indemnity for martial law, but not for an emergency, proves that the framers of the Constitution were having two different concepts in mind. Even as a matter of judicial policy, the provisions restrictive of rights of the people need not be interpreted too broadly. Martial law has not been proclaimed so far, while emergency has been proclaimed several times in the country. To interpret Art. 359, as suggested by Bhagwati, J., is practically to equate emergency with martial law which is hardly necessary. As stated above, the concept of martial law by itself is comprehensive enough to confer all necessary powers on the state to take action for its survival and there is no need to interpret Art. 359 in such a way as if an emergency under Art. 352 is something like martial law in the country. The Shukla ruling was reiterated by the Supreme Court in Bhanudas.19 As there was intense public criticism of the majority ruling in Shukla, Beg, C.J., later sought to justify the Shukla ruling in In re Sham Lal.20Shukla has been severely criticised by scholars in India.21 The period of emergency of 1975-77 can perhaps be characterised as the darkest period in the Indian Constitutional History. All constitutional safeguards devised in the Constitution against abuse of power and against arbitrary power came to naught. The Supreme Court failed to fulfil its role as the saveour of the people's rights. After the emergency, it was realised that the power to order preventive detention was misused by the official machinery during the emergency, and that something should be done so that such a situation might not be repeated in future. Accordingly, Art. 359 has been amended by the 44th Amendment of the Constitution.22 (ii) POSITION AFTER 1978 As a result of the Shukla ruling, the emergency provisions in the Indian Constitution came to be recast through the 44th Amendment of the Constitution enacted in 1978. Amendment 44 restricted the scope of Art. 358 in several ways. First, according to Art.",

    "content": "Art. 359 has been amended by the 44th Amendment of the Constitution.22 (ii) POSITION AFTER 1978 As a result of the Shukla ruling, the emergency provisions in the Indian Constitution came to be recast through the 44th Amendment of the Constitution enacted in 1978. Amendment 44 restricted the scope of Art. 358 in several ways. First, according to Art. 358(1), while a proclamation of emergency declaring that the security of India or any part thereof is threatened by war or by external aggression is in operation, nothing in Art. 19 shall restrict the power of the 'state' to make any law, or to take any executive action which the 'state' would, but for the provisions of Art. 19, be competent to make or to take. Article 19 is not suspended in case the proclamation of emergency has been issued on the ground of armed rebellion. Under Art. 358(1), there is an automatic suspension of Art. 19 as soon as emergency is proclaimed on the ground of war or external aggression, and Art. 19 ceases to restrain the legislature or the executive power of the State or the Centre. This means that the suspension of Art. 19 during the pendency of the proclamation of emergency removes the fetters imposed on the legislative and executive powers by Art. 19 and if the legislature makes a law, or the executive commits acts, which are inconsistent with the rights guaranteed by Art. 19, their validity is not open to challenge either during the continuance of the emergency Page 170 or even thereafter. Second, according to Cl. 2 of Art. 358, Art. 358(1) does not apply to: (i) any law which does not contain a recital to the effect that such law is in relation to the proclamation of emergency in operation when it is made; or, (ii) any executive action taken otherwise than under a law containing such a recital. Article 358(2) makes it clear that only a law enacted in relation to the emergency, but no other law, would be immune from being challenged under Art. 358 during an emergency. In (ii) mentioned above, \"action under a law\" suggests that any action which is ultra vires the law is not protected. According to a proviso to Art. 358(1), where the proclamation of emergency is in operation only in a part of India, any such law may be made, or executive action taken, in relation to the area where the proclamation is not in operation if the security of India is threatened by activities in or in relation to that part in which the proclamation is in operation. This provision makes it possible to extend any law or executive action taken in the part in which emergency prevails to any other part of the country if activities therein threaten the security of India or any part thereof. The effect of Art. 358 thus is that a law of the type mentioned above enacted during the emergency cannot be challenged under Art. 19.23 As soon as the proclamation of emergency is issued on the ground of war or external aggression, Art. 19 ceases to restrict the power of Parliament to make laws. This is an automatic incidence of a proclamation of emergency on the ground of war or external aggression. The power of Parliament thus becomes wider. Similarly the executive power becomes free from the shackles of Art. 19. Any law containing the necessary recital, i.e., 'the law relates to the emergency', is unchallengeable in a Court under Art. 19. The same immunity extends mutatis mutandis to an ordinance made by the President or the Governor for an ordinance has the same effect as an Act.24 The proposition is well-established that Art. 19 becomes ineffective only vis-a-vis a law enacted during the emergency but not with respect to a pre-emergency law. Thus, while the validity of a law enacted during the emergency cannot be challenged on the ground that it infringes Art. 19, the pre-emergency laws can still be challenged on that ground. If such a law was invalid when enacted because it infringed Art. 19 at that time, it remains invalid and would not be revived even when emergency is declared and Art. 19 is suspended. Article 358 is prospective; it does not operate to validate a legislative provision which was invalid because of a constitutional inhibition before the proclamation of emergency. The doctrine of eclipse cannot apply in such a case as such a law would be regarded as voidab initio.25 The plenary power of law-making expanded in pursuance of Art. 358 only from the date of the Proclamation of Emergency and not earlier. An executive action of the type mentioned above taken during emergency cannot also be challenged on the ground that it infringes Art. 19. But such an executive action must otherwise be competent. If it is ultra vires the law under which it is being taken, it is not protected by Art. 358.26 An executive action which is otherwise invalid (outside Art. 19), is not immune from attack, merely because a proclamation of emergency is in operation when it is taken. During the emergency, Art. 19 is suspended, but that cannot authorise the taking of detrimental executive action without any legislative authority, or even in purported exercise of power conferred by any pre-emergency law which was invalid when enacted. In several cases, immunity under Art. 358 has been refused to such executive action as has emanated from, or is a continuation of, the pre-emergency legislation or executive action. Thus, in Bennett Coleman,27 the newsprint policy for 1972-73 of the Central Governmentwas challenged under Art. 19(1)(a). The policy was an emanation from the Newsprint Control Order, 1962, which was made under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, and the Imports and Exports Act of 1947, both being pre-emergency laws. TheSupreme Court Page 171 ruled that the impugned policy being a continuation of the old policy, was not immunized by Art. 358. In the words of the Court, \" Art.",

    "content": "Court Page 171 ruled that the impugned policy being a continuation of the old policy, was not immunized by Art. 358. In the words of the Court, \" Art. 358 does not apply to executive action taken during the emergency if the same is a continuation of the prior executive action or an emanation of the previous law which prior executive action or previous law would otherwise be violative of Art. 19 or be otherwise unconstitutional.\" Later judicial pronouncements have extended the proposition to executive action taken during an emergency under a valid pre-emergency law. Thus, in Shree Meenakshi Mills,28 the Supreme Court ruled that the validity of the notifications issued in 1973 (during emergency) under a pre-emergency law, viz., the Cotton Textiles (Control) Order, 1948, could be challenged under Arts. 19(1)(f) and (g).29 Similar is the ruling of the Punjab High Court which emphasized that Art. 358 immunized new legislation enacted during emergency from an attack under Art. 19, but the state would not thereby become entitled, during emergency to exercise arbitrary powers under pre-emergency legislation. Therefore, delegated legislation made during the emergency under a pre-emergency law can still be challenged under Art. 19.30 The courts have thus given somewhat restrictive operation to Art. 358 as regards pre-emergency legislation and executive action taken during emergency under pre-emergency legislation. As soon as the proclamation of emergency comes to an end, Art. 19 automatically comes back to life and begins to operate. Any statutory provisions passed, and the executive action taken during the emergency can be challenged under Art. 19. Any law inconsistent with Art. 19, made during the emergency, ceases to operate to the extent of its inconsistency with Art. 19. But the liability incurred for acts or omissions during the emergency cannot be nullified even if it be assumed that the Act in question was violative of Art. 19. Article 358, however, makes it clear that things done or omitted to be done during the emergency cannot be challenged even after the emergency is over. In other words, the suspension of Art. 19 is complete during the period in question and legislative and executive action which contravene Art. 19 cannot be questioned even after the emergency is over.31 The result of this clause is that no Act of Indemnity is necessary to immunize against liability for acts done during emergency provided these acts were done under a law containing a recital saying that the law is in relation to the Proclamation of Emergency. Thus, the liability created by an act or omission when the Acts were in operation during the currency of the proclamation of emergency cannot be challenged even after the revocation of the proclamation on the ground that the provisions of the Acts violated Art. 19. The Supreme Court has now explained the effect of Art. 358 as follows in Attorney General for India v. Amratlal Prajivandas.32 Art. 358(1) enables the state to make any law or to take any executive action inconsistent with Art. 19. This power is confined to the period of emergency. As soon as the emergency ceases, the law so made shall, to the extent of inconsistency with Art. 19, cease to have effect, except with respect to things done or omitted to be done before the law so ceases to have effect. \"What it means is that the validity of the law made or the things done or omitted to be done by virtue of the said Article during the period of emergency cannot be questioned either during or after the emergency on the ground of inconsistency with Art. 19.\" Thus, if the freedom of speech has been curtailed during the emergency to the extent not warranted by Art. 19(2), the citizen whose right has been unreasonably curtailed cannot sue the state for damages or any other relief nor can he take any other proceeding for unreasonably curtailing his right during the emergency period. SUSPENSION OF OTHER FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS Article 359 refers to the suspension of the operation of all Fundamental Rights other than Art. 19 during an emergency. Under Art. 359, Fundamental Rights as such are not suspended, but only their enforcement. Before the 44th Amendment, the enforcement of all Fundamental Rights (other than Art. 19 which is the subject-matter of Art. 358), could be suspended during an emergency through a Presidential Order. But to curtail the vast power vested in the executive, the 44th Amendment restricts the scope of Art. 359 somewhat. Art. 359 has been amended so as to provide that the presidential power to suspend the right to move the Court for the enforcement of a Fundamental Right cannot be exercised in respect of the Page 172 Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Arts. 20 and 21. Thus, it is no longer possible to suspend the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed by Art. 21, and the right to protection in respect of conviction for offences guaranteed by Art. 20. The 44th Amendment will obviate in future the situation depicted by the Shukla case. Making Art. 20 inviolate during an emergency means that the government could not harass the people during an emergency by making acts punishable retroactively. The Constitution Amendment 44 also provides further that the suspension of the enforcement of any Fundamental Right under Art. 359 shall not apply in relation to any law which does not contain a recital to the effect that such law is in relation to the proclamation of emergency in operation when it is made, or to any executive action taken otherwise than under a law containing such a recital. Thus, laws other than those passed for the purposes of the emergency will no longer be protected by the Presidential Order issued under Art. 359. Under Art. 359(1), when a proclamation of emergency is in operation, the President may by Order declare that the right to move any Court for the enforcement of such of the Fundamental Rights as may be mentioned in the Order (except Arts.",

    "content": "Under Art. 359(1), when a proclamation of emergency is in operation, the President may by Order declare that the right to move any Court for the enforcement of such of the Fundamental Rights as may be mentioned in the Order (except Arts. 20 and 21),33 and all proceedings pending in any Court for the enforcement of the rights so mentioned, shall remain suspended for the period during which the proclamation is in force, or for such shorter period as may be specified in the Order. What the Presidential Order purports to do under Art. 359(1) is to bar the remedy of the citizens to move any Court for the enforcement of the specified rights. The rights are not expressly suspended, but the citizen is deprived of his right to move any Court for their enforcement. The words of Art. 359(1) are clear and unambiguous. They only speak of suspending the enforcement of the rights but not suspending the rights themselves. The PO issued under Art. 359 does not suspend the rights mentioned therein; what is suspended is their operation. According to Art. 359(1-A), while an Order under Art. 359(1) is in operation, no Fundamental Right mentioned in the said Order (except 20 and 21) \"shall restrict the power of the state to make any law or to take any executive action\" which the state would be competent to make or take but for the Fundamental Rights in question \"but any law so made shall, to the extent of inconsistency, cease to have effect as soon as the order aforesaid ceases to operate except as respects things done or omitted to be done before the law so ceases to have effect\". These words have been borrowed from Art. 358(1) and added to Art. 359 as well. The result is that during the period the Presidential Order suspending enforcement of certain Fundamental Rights is in operation, the state is empowered to make any law or take any executive action inconsistent with such rights. This is so even though in theory these rights are not suspended; they remain alive and only their enforcement is suspended, but Art. 359(1A) has to be given effect to. According to Art. 359(1-B), Art. 359(1-A) does not apply to any law which does not contain a recital to the effect that such law is in relation to the proclamation of emergency in operation when it is made, or to any executive action taken otherwise than under a law containing such a recital. Thus, as regards laws other than those needed for the emergency, all Fundamental Rights continue to operate. According to Art. 359(3), any order made under Art. 359(1) shall, as soon as may be after it is made, be laid before each House of Parliament. According to Art. 359(2), any Presidential Order made under Art. 359(1) may extend to the whole or any part of the territory of India. According to a proviso to Art. 359(2), where a proclamation of emergency is in operation only in part of the Indian territory, any such Order shall not extend to any other part of the territory of India unless the President, being satisfied that the security of India or any part thereof is threatened by activities in or in relation to the part of the territory of India in which the proclamation is in operation, considers such extension to be necessary. There are several points of distinction between Arts. 358 and 359. (i) While Art. 19 is suspended automatically under Art. 358 as soon as the emergency is Page 173 proclaimed, under Art. 359, enforcement of other Fundamental Rights is not so suspended. (ii) In case of Fundamental Rights other than Art. 19, what can be suspended under Art. 359 is their enforcement and that, too, not automatically, but only by an Order of the President and to the extent the President decrees in his Order. (iii) Further, while under Art. 358, Art. 19 remains suspended for the whole of the duration of the emergency, under Art. 359, enforcement of other Fundamental Rights remains suspended so long as the President ordains which may either be the entire duration of the emergency, or a shorter period. (iv) Also, while suspension of Art. 19 is for the entire country and so covers all legislatures and all States, the Order under Art. 359 may extend to the whole or a part of India. (v) Art. 359 operates in any emergency proclaimed under Art. 352, but Art. 358 operates only in case of an emergency on the ground of threat to the security of the country because of war or external aggression. (vi) Under Art. 359, enforcement of Arts. 20 and 21 cannot be suspended. It thus appears that prima facie the effect of Art. 359 is less drastic on the Fundamental Rights than the effect of Art. 358 on Art. 19. The position now is that while enforcement of Art. 21 is not to be suspended at all during an emergency, Art. 22 can be suspended. Thus, the safeguards contained in Art. 22 can be nullified as regards preventive detention. The effect of this will be as follows: (i) A law is necessary to put a person in detention because Art. 21 requires that a person cannot be deprived of his personal liberty without procedure established by law.34 (ii) An order of preventive detention can be challenged not on the ground of any violation of a safeguard contained in Art. 22, but on such grounds as mala fides, or detention not being in accordance with the relevant law, or on any ground on which the exercise of any discretionary power can be challenged under Administrative Law for in such a case the order will cease to be in accordance with law; (iii) The Courts can import principles of natural justice or fairness or reasonableness into such a law as has been held in the Maneka Gandhi case.35 Although, the safeguards under Art.",

As has already been pointed out, the Forty-fourth Constitution Amendment made a number of changes in the Emergency Provisions of the Constitution so as to avoid any misuse of power in future in the name of emergency. Arts. 358 and 359 were also amended. Art. 359 has been amended so as to ensure that never in future in case of declaration of emergency in the country under Art. 352, the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Arts. 20 and 21 would be suspended. In Amratlal Prajivandas,36 an interesting question was raised. Under the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act, 1976 [SAFEMA], the property of a person who was detained under COFEPOSA was to be forfeited. The argument in the instant case was that during the Emergency, COFEPOSA was made much more drastic so as to be inconsistent with Art. 22. So an order of preventive detention was ultra vires Art. 22. Such an order could be tolerated during the emergency but it should be treated for other purposes as void and non-est as Art. 22 was not suspended, only its enforcement was suspended under Art. 359(1). Such an order of detention should not be regarded as an order for the purposes of SAFEMA. So the question was whether it can be said that a detention order made inconsistent with Art. 22 (which was suspended), was void or non-est even though it could not be challenged during the emergency period. In reply the Supreme Court has ruled that such an order of preventive detention could not be treated as void Page 174 or non-existent for the purposes of SAFEMA. Such an order of detention made under COFEPOSA, \"is an order of detention within the meaning and purposes of S. 2(2)(b) of SAFEMA.\" G. NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION NHRC has been set up as a statutory body under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993. The purpose of setting up the Commission is to strengthen the machinery for more effective enforcement of Fundamental Rights of the people. The Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Bill which later became the Act made clear the purposes underlying the proposed enactment. While noting that India was a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both of which were adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 16th December 1966, and that the rights embodied in those Covenants stood substantially protected by the Constitution of India, the Statement observed that there had been \"growing concern in the country and abroad about issues relating to human rights.\" Having regard to this, and to the changing social realities and emerging trends in the nature of crime and violence, it has been considered essential to review the existing laws and procedures and the system of administration with a view to bringing about greater efficiency and transparency. The Act provides for the establishment of the National Human Rights Commission, the State Human Rights Commissions in the States, and the Human Rights Courts for the better protection of human rights and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. The Central Government constitutes the NHRC. The Commission consists of the following: (1) A chairperson who has been the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India; (2) One member who is or has been a Judge of the Supreme Court; (3) One member who is or has been the Chief Justice of a High Court; and (4) Two members who are to be appointed from amongst the persons having knowledge of, or practical experience in, matters relating to human rights. The chairperson and members of the Commission are to be appointed by the President of India. Every such appointment is to be made after securing the recommendations of a committee consisting of the following persons: (i) Prime Minister as chairperson; (ii) Speaker of the Lok Sabha; (iii) Minister in charge of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India; (iv) Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha; (v) Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha; and (vi) Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha. The Chairperson of the Commission holds office for a term of five years from the date on which he enters upon his office, or until he attains the age of 70 years, whichever is earlier. A member holds office for a term of five years and he is eligible for appointment for one more term of five years. However, no member shall hold office after he reaches the age of 70 years. After ceasing to hold office, the Chairperson or a member is not eligible for any appointment under the Government of India or of a State Government. Salaries and allowances payable to the members shall be as prescribed. The salary and allowances of a member shall not be varied to his disadvantage after he has been appointed. To make members of the Commission independent of government control, the Act provides that the Chairperson or any member of the Commission shall not be removable except by an order of the President on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity after the Supreme Court, on a reference being made to it by the President, has, after an inquiry held in accordance with the procedure prescribed by the Supreme Page 175 Court, reported that the chairperson or the member concerned, as the case may be, ought on such ground be removed.",

The Chairpersons of the National Commission for Minorities,37 the National Commission for Women38 and the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes39 are deemed to be members of the Commission for (NHRC) the discharge of the various functions assigned to it, except for the function relating to inquiry into complaints of violation of human rights, viz., the function mentioned in S. 12(a)(i) and (ii) of the Act. Individuals and interested parties can make complaints to the Commission regarding violations of human rights in the country. A number of complaints received by the Commission are dismissed on one of the following grounds: (1) The complaint does not fall within the purview of the Commission; (2) The matter is sub judice or pending before another Commission; (3) The event which is the object of the Complaint, occurred more than one year before the making of the complaint; (4) The complaint is vague or frivolous and no specific case has been made out of a human rights violation. Sections 11(1) and (2) of the Act provide that: (1) The Central Government shall make available to the Commission:-- (a) an officer of the rank of Secretary to the Government of India who shall be the Secretary General of the Commission; and (b) such police and investigative staff under an officer not below the rank of a Director General of Police and such other officers and staff as may be necessary for the efficient performance of the functions of the Commission. (2) Subject to such rules as may be made by the Central Government in this behalf, the Commission may appoint such other administrative, technical and scientific staff as it may consider necessary. The functions to be discharged by the Commission are listed in S. 12 of the Act. These are: (a) to inquire, suo motu or on a petition presented to it by a victim or any person on his behalf, into complaint of-- (i) violation of human rights or abetment thereof, or (ii) negligence in the prevention of such violation, by a public servant; (b) to intervene in any proceeding involving any allegation of violation of human rights pending before a Court with the approval of such Court; (c) to visit, under intimation to the State Government, any jail or any other institution under the control of the State Government, where persons are detained or lodged for purposes of treatment, reformation or protection to study the living conditions of the inmates and make recommendations thereon; (d) to review the safeguards provided by or under the Constitution or any law for the time being in force for the protection of human rights and recommend measures for their effective implementation; (e) to review the factors, including acts of terrorism that inhibit the employment of human rights and Page 176 recommend appropriate remedial measures; (f) to study treaties and other international instruments on human rights and make recommendations for their effective implementation; (g) to undertake and promote research in the field of human rights; (h) to spread human rights literacy among various sections of society and promote awareness of the safeguards available for the protection of these rights through publications, the media, seminars, and other available means; (i) to encourage the efforts of non-governmental organisations and institutions working in the field of human rights; (j) such other functions as it may consider necessary for the promotion of human rights. In S. 12(a), the expression human rights has been used. S. 2(b) of the Act defines 'human rights' to mean \"the rights relating to life, liberty, equality and dignity of the individual guaranteed by the Constitution, embodied in the International Conventions and enforceable by courts in India.\" Thus, the rights guaranteed by International Conventions to which India has acceded have been included within the term \"human rights\". Commenting on the above definition, the Supreme Court has observed in Madhu Kishwar v. State of Bihar :40 \"Thereby the principles embodied in CEDAW and the concomitant Right to Development become integral parts of the Indian Constitution and the Human Rights Act and became enforceable. S. 12of the Protection of Human Rights Act charges the Commission with duty for proper implementation as well as prevention of violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms.\" CEDAW, mentioned above, stands for the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women. This Convention was adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 18, 1979, and the Government of India ratified the Convention on June 19, 1993, and acceded to CEDAW on August 8, 1993. The Government however made some reservations on Articles 5(e), 16(1), 16(2) and 29 of the Convention which condemns discrimination against women in all its forms. The Commission has been given ample powers to enable it to discharge its functions effectively. The Commission has power to regulate its own procedure. It has, while inquiring into complaints under the Act, powers of a civil Court trying a suit under the Code of Civil Procedure, and, in particular, in respect of the following matters: (i) summoning and enforcing the attendance of witnesses and examining them on oath; (ii) discovery and production of documents; (iii) receiving evidence in affidavits; (iv) requisitioning any public record or copy thereof from any Court or office; (v) issuing commissions for the examination of witnesses or documents; (vi) any other manner which may be prescribed. Any officer or agency conducting any investigation on behalf of the Commission enjoys similar powers.",

    "content": "officer or agency conducting any investigation on behalf of the Commission enjoys similar powers. The Commission has power to require any person, subject to any privilege which may be claimed by that person, under any law for the time being in force, to furnish information on such points or matters as, in the opinion of the Commission, may be useful for, or relevant to, the subject matter of the inquiry. Any person so required is legally bound to furnish such information within the meaning of Ss. 176 and 177 of the Indian Penal Code. The Commission or any of its authorised officer may enter any building or place where the Commission has reason to believe that any document relating to the subject matter of the inquiry may be found, and may seize any such document. This power is subject to S. 100 , Cr.P.C. The Commission is deemed to be a civil Court. When any of the following offences is committed; viz;S. 175 , IPC,41 178, IPC,42S. 179IPC,43S. 180 , IPC,44S. 228 , IPC,45in the view or presence of the Commission, the Commission may, after recording the facts constituting the offence and the statement of the accused as provided for in the Cr.P.C., forward the case to a magistrate and he will proceed to hear the complaint Page 177 against the accused. Every proceeding before the Commission is to be regarded as a judicial proceeding within the meaning of Ss. 193 (punishment for false evidence) and 228, IPC, (intentional insult or interruption to public servant sitting in judicial capacity) and for the purposes of s. 196 , IPC. The Commission is regarded as a civil Court for all purposes of S. 195 , Cr.P.C., and Chapter XXVI, Cr.P.C.46 The Commission is authorised, for the purpose of conducting any investigation pertaining to the inquiry, to utilise the services of any officer or investigation agency of the Central or State Government with its permission. No statement made by a person in the course of giving evidence before the Commission shall subject him to, or be used against him, in any civil or criminal proceeding except a prosecution for giving false evidence, provided that that the statement--(a) is made in reply to the question which he is required by the Commission to answer; or (b) is relevant to the subject matter of the inquiry. If the Commission considers it necessary to inquire into the conduct of any person, or is of the opinion that the reputation of any person is likely to be prejudicially affected by the inquiry, the Commission must give that person a reasonable opportunity of being heard in the inquiry and to produce evidence in his defence. While inquiring into any complaint of violation of human rights, the Commission may call for information from the Central or the State Government or any other authority or organisation subordinate thereto within such time as may be specified by it. If the Commission does not receive information within the time stipulated, it may proceed to inquire into the matter by itself. If on receiving information, the Commission is satisfied that no further inquiry is required, or that the required action has been taken by the concerned government or authority, it may not proceed with the complaint and inform the complainant accordingly. The Commission is authorised to take any of the following steps on the completion of an inquiry: (i) where the inquiry disclosed violation of human rights, the Commission may recommend to the concerned government or authority the initiation of proceedings for prosecution or such other action against the concerned person or persons; (ii) approach the Supreme Court or the concerned High Court for such directions, orders or writs as that Court may deem necessary; (iii) recommend to the concerned authority the grant of an interim relief to the victim or the members of his family as the Commission may consider necessary; (iv) provide a copy of the inquiry report to the petitioner or his representative; (v) send a copy of the inquiry report together with its recommendations to the concerned government or authority and the concerned government or authority shall, within a period of one month or such further time as the Commission may allow, forward its comments on the report, including the action taken or proposed to be taken thereon, to the Commission; (vi) shall publish its inquiry report together with the comments of the concerned government or authority, if any, and the action taken or proposed to be taken by the concerned government or authority on the recommendation of the Commission. The Act lays down special procedure for dealing with complaints of violation of human rights by members of the armed forces. The Commission has to submit an annual report to the Central Government and to the State Government concerned. The Commission may submit special reports on any matter which, in its opinion, is of such urgency or importance that it should not be deferred till submission of the annual report [ S. 20(1)]. The Central Government or the State Government, as the case may be, shall cause the annual or the special report of the Commission to be laid before each House of Parliament or the State Legislature respectively, as the case may be, along with a memorandum of action taken or proposed to be taken of the recommendations of the Commission and the reasons for the non-acceptance of the recommendations, if any. The functions assigned to NHRC are vast in scope and range. The Commission is required not only to Page 178 promote and protect all the Fundamental Rights enshrined in the Constitution of India but also those covered by treaties to which India is a party.",

    "content": "Commission is required not only to Page 178 promote and protect all the Fundamental Rights enshrined in the Constitution of India but also those covered by treaties to which India is a party. Most of the complaints which come before the Commission relate to such matters as custodial deaths and rape, disappearance of persons from custody, cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment and torture, gender related violence, atrocities against vulnerable sectors of society, such as, women, children and the disabled, especially those belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The Commission can take cognisance of a matter suo motu even if it receives no complaint about it. S. 12(d) of the PHRA, 1993, requires the Commission to \"review the safeguards provided by or under the Constitution or any law for the time being in force for the protection of human rights and recommend measures, for their effective implementation. Accordingly, the Commission monitored the implementation of Tada [--a draconian Law and, finally, suggested that this law be repealed.47 Under S. 12(b), the Commission can intervene in Court proceedings pertaining to enforcement of human rights.48 S. 12(c) authorises the Commission to make recommendations on the prison conditions. The Commission has expressed its concern about the appalling conditions of over-crowding, lack of sanitation, poor medical facilities, etc. in most of the jails in the country.49 A very significant responsibility has been entrusted to the Commission under S. 12(b) which requires the Commission \"to spread human rights literacy among various sections of society.\" The Commission has been taking steps to fulfil this responsibility.50 Section 12(g) entrusts the Commission with the responsibility of undertaking and promoting research in the field of human rights. Further S. 12(i) asks the Commission to encourage the efforts of non-government organizations working in the field of human rights. This is important for NGOs are life and soul of the effort to promote and protect human rights.51 The Commission has explicitly stated that women's rights will be a part of its concerns. The Supreme Court has given a much wider dimension to the functioning of the NHRC through its ruling in Paramjit Kaur v. State of Punjab .52 The Court has held that under Art. 32, it can refer any matter to the Commission for inquiry and the Commission then acts sui generis under the remit of the Supreme Court and, in such a case, the Commission is not bound by the shackles and limitations of the NHRC Act. The Court has described the Commission as \"a unique expert body in itself\". Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution represent the basic human rights possessed by every human being. The Supreme Court's jurisdiction under Art. 32 \"cannot be curtailed by any statutory limitation\" including those contained in the various provisions of NHRC Act. The Court has emphasized that all authorities in the country are bound by the directions of the Supreme Court and have to act in aid of the Court [ Art. 144].53 Therefore, when the Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Art. 32 entrusts to the NHRC to deal with certain matter in the manner indicated in the Court order--the Commission would function pursuant to the directions issued by the Supreme Court and not under the Act constituting it. The Court has observed:54 \"In deciding the matters referred by this Court, NHRC is given a free hand and is not circumscribed by any conditions. Therefore, the jurisdiction exercised by the Commission in these matters is of a special nature not covered by enactment or law and thus acts sui generis.\" Reference may be made to another Supreme Court pronouncement in NHRC v. Arunachal Pradesh .55 Here the Commission assumes a new role--that of a writ petitioner before the Supreme Court. A large number of Chakmas had crossed over from Bangladesh and were residing in Arunachal Pradesh for some time. The local students body resented this and threatened to evict the Chakmas by force. The Commission came to the conclusion that the local officers were siding with the students and there was imminent threat to the lives of the Chakmas. The Commission, therefore, decided to file a writ petition in the Supreme Court under Art. 32 seeking enforcement of the rights of Chakmas under Art. 21 of the Constitution.56 The Court allowed the Page 179 petition and directed the State to ensure the life and personal liberty of each Chakma and to ensure that they are not evicted from the State except in accordance with law. The Court pointed out that the country is governed by Rule of Law. The State is bound to protect the life and liberty of every human being, be he a citizen or otherwise. Accordingly, the Court directed the State, to repel by force any attempt to evict the Chakmas by force from the State. NHRC acts as a watchdog to protect human rights. It is expected to play an active role in ending violations of human rights. The most important feature of the Commission is its power to independently probe cases of violations of human rights. The Commission can act suo motu without waiting for any formal application if any violation of a human right comes to its notice. The term \"human rights\" has been broadly defined. The Commission is expected to play an active role in ending violations of human rights.57 STATE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION The Act also makes provisions [ S. 21] for the State Governments to constitute similar commissions in the States. A State Commission is to consist of five members--one Chairperson who has been the Chief Justice of a High Court; one member who has been a Judge of the High Court; one member who has been a district judge and two other members to be appointed from amongst persons having knowledge and practical experience in matters relating to human rights.",

    "content": "these members are to be appointed by the Governor after obtaining the recommendations of a Committee consisting of the following: (i) Chief Minister (Chairperson); (ii) Speaker of the Legislative Assembly; (iii) Home Minister; (iv) Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly; (v) Chairman of the Legislative Council, if any; (iv) Leader of the opposition in the Legislative Council, if any. Most of the provisions applicable to the National Commission also apply to the State Commission. A State Commission may inquire into violation of human rights only in respect of matters relatable to the entries enumerated in Lists II and III of the VII Schedule to the Constitution.58 The State Government may specify for each district a Court of session to be the Human Rights Court for speedy trial of offences arising out of violations of human rights. The State Government is to exercise this power with the concurrence of the Chief Justice of the High Court. For every such Human Rights Court, the State Government has to specify a public prosecutor or appoint an advocate, who has been in practice as an advocate for not less than seven years. There are many reasons to support the establishment of the State Human Rights Commissions. India is a big country and, therefore, there should be State Commissions as well in addition to the National Commission. The redressal of grievances of breach of human rights must be swift and inexpensive, the message of human rights must reach the grass root level. The federal character of the country should be respected by establishing separate National and State HRCs. Such Commissions have been established in several States. In the State of Uttar Pradesh a notification to establish the Commission was issued on 4-4-1996 but it was later rescinded. The Allahabad High Court has now ruled in Poeples' Union for Civil Liberties, Allahabad v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 59 that the notification was rescinded arbitrarily. The Court has therefore quashed the subsequent notification nullifying the first notification and directed the State Government to set up the Commission. 1. Supra, Ch. XX, Sec. C. 2.

M P Jain Indian Constitutional Law/Volume 2/PART V POLITICAL AND CIVIL RIGHTS/CHAPTER XXXIV DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICY AND BASIC DUTIES Page 191 CHAPTER XXXIV Directive Principles of State Policy and Basic Duties A. NATURE OF THE DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES Articles 36 to 51 contain the Directive Principles of State Policy. The idea to have such principles in the Constitution has been borrowed from the Irish Constitution. There was a time, known as the laissez faire era, when the state was mainly concerned with the maintenance of law and order and defence of the country against external aggression. Such a restrictive concept of the state no longer remains valid. The makers of the Constitution had realized that in a poor country like India, political democracy would be useless without economic democracy. Accordingly, they incorporated a few provisions in the Constitution with a view to achieve amelioration of the socio-economic condition of the masses. Today we are living in an era of welfare state which seeks to promote the prosperity and well-being of the people. The Directive Principles strengthen and promote this concept by seeking to lay down some socio-economic goals which the various governments in India have to strive to achieve. The Directive Principles are designed to usher in a social and economic democracy in the country. These principles obligate the state to take positive action in certain directions in order to promote the welfare of the people and achieve economic democracy. These principles give directions to the legislatures and the executive in India as regards the manner in which they should exercise their power.1 In a number of pronouncements, the Supreme Court has insisted that these Directive Principles seek to introduce the concept of a welfare state in the country. Thus, we find the Supreme Court observing in Paschim Banga:2 \"The Constitution envisages the establishment of a welfare state at the federal level as well as the State level. In a welfare state the primary duty of the Government is to secure the welfare of the people.\" The Directive Principles differ from Fundamental Rights3 which enjoin the state to refrain from taking prejudicial action against an individual and, thus, impose a negative duty on the state. Fundamental Rights seek to introduce an egalitarian society and to ensure liberty for all. The Directive Principles seek to achieve a welfare state. The two together constitute the conscience of the Constitution. Originally, the Directive Principles were more akin to moral, rather than to legal, precepts as they did not have much value from a legal point of view. The main idea underlying these principles was that they would serve an educational purpose, and might serve as restraints on those who come in power. These persons would have to pay some respect to those principles while exercising power, and could be held accountable for ignoring them before the electorate if not before a Court of law. In the Constituent Assembly, Dr. Ambedkar had said that a party which failed to implement these principles would stand to lose in the next elections. Thus, the accountability to enforce these principles was left to the political process.",

In the Constituent Assembly, Dr. Ambedkar had said that a party which failed to implement these principles would stand to lose in the next elections. Thus, the accountability to enforce these principles was left to the political process. With the passage of time, however, greater emphasis has come to be laid on the fulfilment of the goals set out in these principles. Article 37 says that the Directive Principles \"shall not be enforceable by any Court, but the principles therein laid down are nevertheless fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the State to apply these principles in making laws.\" The term 'state' in Art. 37 has the same meaning as has been given to it in Art. 12 and which has been explained earlier.4 Page 192 PREAMBLE TO THE CONSTITUTION The Preamble to the Constitution lays down the goals of politico-socio-economic democracy for the citizens of India.5 The Preamble emphasizes that India should be a socialist secular democratic republic. The Preamble further states that the People of India have given the Constitution to themselves to secure to all its citizens justice--social, economic and political; liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship; Equality of status and of opportunity, and Fraternity assuring the dignity of the individual. The three concepts-liberty, equality and fraternity--constitute a trinity; one cannot be divorced from the other. The Supreme Court has emphasized in Keshavananda6 that the Preamble to the Constitution emphasizes the principle of equality as basic to the Indian Constitution. This is the basic feature of the Constitution which no legislature in India can transgress. Even an Amendment of the Constitution offending a basic structure of the Constitution is ultra vires. It may however be mentioned here that in India, the concept of equality is regarded not as a static, but a dynamic concept. It permits every process of equalisation and protective discrimination. Progressive measures to eliminate group disabilities and promote collective equality are not regarded as antagonistic to the concept of equality on the ground that every individual is entitled to equality of opportunity based purely on merit. Such an approach would perpetuate existing inequalities. Those who are unequal, in fact, cannot be treated by identical standards. That may amount to equality in law or formal equality but it would certainly not be real or substantive equality. It is necessary to take into account de facto inequalities which exist in society and to remove which affirmative action needs to be taken. This may involve giving preference to the socially and educationally disadvantaged persons, or inflicting handicaps on those more advantageously placed. Such affirmative action though apparently discriminatory is calculated to produce equality on a broader basis by eliminating de facto inequalities.7 As the Supreme Court has observed in Valsamma:8 \"In other words, equal protection requires affirmative action for those unequals handicapped due to historical facts of untouchability practised for millennium which is abolished by Article 17; for Tribes living away from our national mainstream due to social and educational backwardness of OBCs\".9 Further, the Constitution-makers rightly perceived that mere political democracy would be meaningless in a country of the poor millions without economic justice. The ideals stated in the Preamble are reinforced through the Directive Principles of State Policy which spell out in greater detail the goal of economic democracy, the socio-economic content of political freedom, the concept of a welfare state. The Directive Principles thus supplement the Preamble to the Constitution. These principles have been characterised as 'basic to our social order' as they seek to build a socially just society. These principles have been drafted in flexible and general language and leave enough leeway to the various governments in the country to frame their policies from time to time in accordance with the contemporary needs and circumstances of the society to achieve the goals set out therein. These principles do not impose any particular socio-economic philosophy on the country. These principles have played a crucial role in legislative and administrative policy-making in the country. They have inspired the idea of a socialist pattern of society; the process of planning has been oriented towards achieving the goals contained in them;10 agrarian economy has been restructured; right to property has been very much diluted;11 public industrial and economic sector has extended and a pervasive system of government regulation of private economic enterprise has been created12. Constant efforts are being made to improve the position of backward and economically weaker sections of society.13 However, in spite of the best intentions to fulfil these principles, there have been deficiencies in the implementation of the policies framed for the purpose and much remains to be done.14 While a surfeit of laws have been enacted to promote the programmes and policies envisaged by the Directive Principles, there has been failure on the part of the administration by way of non-administration, maladministration and misadministration of these laws. Recently the Supreme Court observed \"the State Government is totally oblivious of its responsibilities regarding implementation of social welfare programmes of providing secured homes to destitute women and Page 193 also children in conflict with law\".15 Originally, the word 'socialist' did not appear in the Preamble. In 1976, the Preamble was amended by the 42nd Constitution Amendment to give socialist orientation to the Indian Polity as India was now declared as a \"Sovereign Socialist Secular Democracy\". The term \"socialist\" has been brought in the Constitution to establish an egalitarian social order through rule of law as it basic structure.16 The case-law is replete with expression of judicial opinion defining socialism. The main emphasis is on the establishment of an egalitarian social order through rule of law.",

The main emphasis is on the establishment of an egalitarian social order through rule of law. In Minerva Mills,17 the Supreme Court considered the meaning of \"Socialism\" as to crystallise a socialistic state securing to its people socio-economic justice by interplay of the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles. In Nakara,18 the Supreme Court has stated that democratic socialism achieves socio-economic revolution to end poverty, ignorance, disease and inequality of opportunity. This idea has been reiterated by the Supreme Court in a number of its pronouncements.19 The basic framework of socialism provides a decent standard of life to the working people. In Ranganath Reddy,20 the Supreme Court has stated that the aim of socialism is the distribution of the material resources of the community in such a way as to subserve the common good. In Sanjeev Coal,21 the Supreme Court has held that the broad egalitarian principle is implicit in every Directive Principle. The law ought to be designed so as to promote broader egalitarian social goals to do economic justice for all. The Preamble to the Constitution read with Directive Principles in Arts. 38, 42, 43, 46 and 48A promotes the concept of social justice. The aim of social justice is to attain a substantial degree of social, economic and political equality. Social justice is a device to mitigate the suffering of the poor, weak, Tribals and the deprived sections of the society and to elevate them so that they can live with dignity. In course of time, the Courts have raised social and economic justice to the high level of a Fundamental Right.22 While upholding the Constitutionality of the amendment to Art. 15 by inserting Art. 15(5), the Supreme Court in Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India23 held that the objective of social justice incorporated in the Preamble of the Constitution and the Directive Principles had been secured by including Art. 15(5) as a fundamental right in Part III. In short, all state action should be such as to make socio-economic democracy with liberty, equality and fraternity, a reality to all the people through democratic socialism under the rule of law. Right to social and economic justice has now been held to be a Fundamental Right.24 The Preamble, the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles have been characterised as the 'trinity' of the Constitution.25 B. JUSTICIABILITY OF DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES The Preamble, the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles can be characterised as the trinity of the constitution. The Directive Principles seek to give certain directions to the legislatures and governments in India as to how, and in what manner and for what purpose, they are to exercise their power. But, these principles are specifically made non-enforceable by any Court of law. Art. 37 of the Constitution states: \"The provisions contained in this Part shall not be enforceable by any Court, but the principles therein laid down are nevertheless fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the State to apply these principles in making laws.\" The reason behind the legal non-enforceability and non-justiciability of these principles is that they impose positive obligations on the state. While taking positive action, government functions under several restraints, the most crucial of these being that of financial resources. The constitution-makers, therefore, taking a pragmatic view refrained from giving teeth to these principles. They believed more in an awakened public Page 194 opinion, rather than in Court proceedings, as the ultimate sanction for the fulfilment of these principles. Nevertheless, the Constitution declares that the Directive Principles, though not enforceable by any Court, are 'fundamental' in the governance of the country, and the 'state' has been placed under an obligation to apply them in making laws. The state has thus to make laws and use its administrative machinery for the achievement of these Directive Principles. The Courts do not however enforce a Directive Principle, as such, as it does not create any justiciable right in favour of an individual.26 A Court will not issue an order or a writ of mandamus to the government to fulfil a Directive Principle.27 The Supreme Court has again reiterated28 that \"this Court has no power to give directions for the enforcement of the Directive Principles of the State Policy... This Court has time and again reiterated the position that Directives... are not enforceable in Courts as they do not create any justiciable rights in favour of any person\". But the Courts are, nevertheless, bound \"to evolve, affirm and adopt principles of interpretation which will further and not hinder the goals set out in the Directive Principles of State Policy.\"29 For example, the Supreme Court has observed in Meenakshi Mills:30 \"Ordinarily any restriction so imposed which has the effect of promoting or effectuating a directive principle can be presumed to be a reasonable restriction in public interest\". Fundamental Rights, on the other hand, create negative obligations on the state, i.e., the state is required to refrain from doing something, and it is easier to enforce through a Court a negative, as compared to a positive, obligation. Accordingly, Art. 13 declares that a law inconsistent with a Fundamental Right is void.31 But there has never been such a provision in the Constitution as regards the Directive Principles. Therefore, a law inconsistent with a Directive Principle cannot be declared invalid. The Directive Principles guide the exercise of legislative power but do not control the same.32 For example, grant of a virtual monopoly of a business to a co-operative society cannot be declared unconstitutional even if it may infringe Art.",

    "content": "Nor does a Directive Principle confer any legislative competence on a legislature which it does not have otherwise.34 Therefore, a resolution passed by a municipality which is ultra vires the Municipal Act cannot be validated by invoking a Directive Principle.35 Similarly, the competence of a legislature to enact a law is to be adjudged with reference to the entries in the three legislative lists and not with reference to the Directive Principles which confer no legislative power.36 However, the values underlying the Directive Principles, viz., welfare of the poor and weaker sections of society, have crept in the interpretation of economic legislation by the judiciary and this is a substantial gain. This becomes clear from the discussion which follows. C. INTER-RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES The question of relationship between the Directive Principles and the Fundamental Rights has caused some difficulty, and the judicial attitude has undergone transformation on this question over time. What if a law enacted to enforce a directive principle infringes a Fundamental Right? On this question, the judicial view has veered round from irreconcilability to integration between the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles and, in some of the more recent cases, to giving primacy to the Directive Principles.37 Initially, the Courts adopted a strict and literal legal position in this respect. The Supreme Court adopting the literal interpretative approach to Art. 37 ruled that a Directive Principle could not override a Fundamental Right, and, that in case of conflict between the two, the Fundamental Right would prevail over the Directive Principle. This point was settled by the Supreme Court in State of Madras v. Champakam Dorairajan, where a government order in conflict with Art. 29(2), a Fundamental Right, was declared invalid, although the government did argue that it was made in pursuance of Art. 46, a Directive Principle.38 The Court ruled that while the Fundamental Rights were enforceable, the Directive Principles were not, and so the laws made to implement Directive Principles could not take away Fundamental Rights. The Directive Principles should conform, and run as subsidiary, to the Fundamental Rights. The Fundamental Rights would be reduced to 'a Page 195 mere rope of sand' if they were to be overridden by the Directive Principles. The Court observed in this regard: \"The Directive Principles of the State Policy, which by Art. 37 are expressly made unenforceable by a Court cannot override the provisions found in Part III (Fundamental Rights) which, notwithstanding other provisions, are expressly made enforceable by appropriate writs, orders or directions under article 32. The Chapter on Fundamental Rights is sancrosant and not liable to be abridged by any legislative or executive act or order, except to the extent provided in the appropriate article in Part III. The Directive Principles of State Policy have to conform to and run as subsidiary to the Chapter on Fundamental Rights.\" In course of time, a perceptible change came over the judicial attitude on this question. The Supreme Court's view as regards the interplay of Directive Principles and Fundamental Rights underwent a change. The Supreme Court started giving a good deal of value to the Directive Principles from a legal point of view and started arguing for harmonizing the two--the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles. The Supreme Court came to adopt the view that although Directive Principles, as such, were legally non-enforceable, nevertheless, while interpreting a statute, the Courts could look for light to the \"lode star\" of the Directive Principles. \"Where two judicial choices are available, the construction in conformity with the social philosophy\" of the Directive Principles has preference.39 The Courts therefore could interpret a statute so as to implement Directive Principles instead of reducing them to mere theoretical ideas. This is on the assumption that the law makers are not completely unmindful or obvious of the Directive Principles. Further the Courts also adopted the view that in determining the scope and ambit of Fundamental Rights, the Directive Principles should not be completely ignored and that the Courts should adopt the principle of harmonious construction and attempt to give effect to both as far as possible. For example, as early as 1958, in Kerala Education Bill,40 Das, C.J., while affirming the primacy of Fundamental Rights over Directive Principles, qualified the same by pleading for a harmonious interpretation of the two. He observed: \"Nevertheless, in determining the scope and ambit of the Fundamental Rights relied upon by or on behalf of any person or body, the Court may not entirely ignore these Directive Principles of State Policy laid down in Part IV of the Constitution but should adopt the principle of harmonious construction and should attempt to give effect to both as much as possible.\"41 Without, therefore, making the Directive Principles justiciable as such, the Courts began to implement the values underlying these principles to the extent possible. The Supreme Court began to assert that there is \"no conflict on the whole\" between the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles. \"They are complementary and supplementary to each other.\"42 Since then, the judicial attitude has become more positive and affirmative towards Directive Principles, and both Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles have come to be regarded as co-equal. There is in effect a judicial tendency to interpret Fundamental Rights in the light of, and so as to promote, the values underlying Directive Principles. This aspect of the Directive Principles was stressed upon by the Supreme Court in Golak Nath.43 The Supreme Court there emphasized that the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles formed an 'integrated scheme' which was elastic enough to respond to the changing needs of the society. In Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, 44 Hegde and Mukherjea, JJ., observed: \"The Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles constitute the \"conscience of the Constitution...\" There is no antithesis between the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles...and one supplements the other.\" Shelat and Grover, JJ., observed in their judgment: \"Both Parts III (Fundamental Rights) and IV (Directive Principles) ......",

    "content": "to be balanced and harmonised...then alone the dignity of the individual can be achieved....They were meant to supplement each other.\" Page 196 The Supreme Court said in State of Kerala v. N.M. Thomas, 45 that the Directive Principles and Fundamental Rights should be construed in harmony with each other and every attempt should be made by the Court to resolve any apparent inconsistency between them. In Pathumma v. State of Kerala, 46 the Supreme Court has emphasized that the purpose of the Directive Principles is to fix certain socio-economic goals for immediate attainment by bringing about a non-violent social revolution. The Constitution aims at bringing about synthesis between Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles. Recently, in Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India47, Balakrishnan, CJI said that no distinction can be made between the two sets of rights. The fundamental rights represent the civil and political rights and the directive principles embody social and economic rights. Merely because the directive principles are non-justiciable by the judicial process does not mean that they are of subordinate importance. The Directive Principles and Fundamental Rights are not now regarded as exclusionary of each other. They are regarded as supplementary and complementary to each other. In course of time, the judicial attitude has veered from irreconcilability to integration of the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles. The Directive Principles which have been declared to be \"fundamental\" in the governance of the country cannot be isolated from Fundamental Rights. The Directive Principles have got to be read into the Fundamental Rights. An example of such relationship is furnished by the \"Right to education\".48 The Supreme Court has argued in Olga Tellis,49 that since the Directive Principles are fundamental in the governance of the country they must, therefore, be regarded as equally fundamental to the understanding and interpretation of the meaning and content of Fundamental Rights. Chandrachud, C.J., in Minerva Mills,50 said that the Fundamental Rights \"are not an end in themselves but are the means to an end.\" The end is specified in the Directive Principles. It was further observed in the same case that the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles together \"constitute the core of commitment to social revolution and they, together, are the conscience of the Constitution.\" The Indian Constitution is founded on the bedrock of \"the balance\" between the two. \"To give absolute primacy to one over the other is to disturb the harmony of the Constitution. This harmony and balance between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles is an essential feature of the basic structure of the Constitution.\" The Fundamental Rights \"are not an end in themselves but are the means to an end.\" The end is specified in Directive Principles. On the other hand, the goals set out in Directive Principles are to be achieved without abrogating the Fundamental Rights. \"It is in this sense\" that Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles \"together constitute the core of our Constitution and combine to form its conscience. Anything that destroys the balance between the two parts will ipso facto destroy an essential element of the basic structure of our Constitution.\"51 In Unnikrishnan v. State of Andhra Pradesh, 52 Jeevan Reddy, J., said that the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles are supplementary and complimentary to each other, and not exclusionary of each other, and that the Fundamental Rights are but a means to achieve the goals indicated in the Directive Principles and that \"Fundamental Rights must be construed in the light of the Directive Principles.\" In Dalmia Cement,53 the Supreme Court has emphasized that the core of the commitment of the Constitution to the social revolution through rule of law lies in effectuation of the Fundamental Rights and directory principles as supplementary and complimentary to each other. The Preamble to the Constitution, Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles--the trinity--are the conscience of the Constitution. Since then it has now become a judicial strategy to read Fundamental Rights along with Directive Principles with a view to define the scope and ambit of the former. By and large this assimilative strategy has resulted in broadening, and giving greater depth and dimension to, and even creating more rights for the people over and above the expressly stated, Fundamental Rights. At the same time, the values underlying the Directive Principles have also become enforceable by riding on the back of the Fundamental Rights. On the whole, a survey of the case-law shows that the Courts have used Directive Principles not to restrict, but rather to Page 197 expand, the ambit of the Fundamental Rights. The theme that \"Fundamental Rights are but a means to achieve the goal indicated in the Directive Principles\" and that \"Fundamental Rights must be construed in the light of the Directive Principles\" has been advocated by the Supreme Court time and again.54 Thus, the integrative approach towards Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles, or that the both should be interpreted and read together, has now come to hold the field. It has now become a judicial strategy to read Fundamental Rights along with Directive Principles with a view to define the scope and the ambit of the former. Mostly, Directive Principles have been used to broaden, and to give depth to some Fundamental Rights and to imply some more rights therefrom for the people over and above what are expressly stated in the Fundamental Rights. Reference has already been made to this aspect earlier.55 A little more is said below in this connection. The biggest beneficiary of this approach has been Art. 21. By reading Art. 21 with the Directive Principles, the Supreme Court has derived therefrom a bundle of rights. To name a few of these: (i) The right to live with human dignity. The Supreme Court has stated in Bandhua Mukti Morcha, that right to live with human dignity enshrined in Art.",

    "content": "By reading Art. 21 with the Directive Principles, the Supreme Court has derived therefrom a bundle of rights. To name a few of these: (i) The right to live with human dignity. The Supreme Court has stated in Bandhua Mukti Morcha, that right to live with human dignity enshrined in Art. 21 derives its life breath from the Directive Principles of State Policy.56 (ii) Right to life includes the right to enjoy pollution free water and air and environment.57 (iii) Right to health and social justice has been held to be a Fundamental Right of the workers. It is the obligation of the employer to protect the health and vigour of his employee workers. The Court has derived this right by reading Art. 21 with Arts. 39(e), 41, 43 and 48A.58 (iv) Right to Shelter.59 (v) Right to education implicit in Art. 21 is to be spelled out in the light of the Directive Principle contained in Art. 41 and 45.60 (vi) Right to Privacy.61 Accordingly, the Directive Principles are regarded as a dependable index of 'public purpose'. If a law is enacted to implement the socio-economic policy envisaged in the Directive Principles, then it must be regarded as one for public purpose. Thus, in State of Bihar v. Kameshwar, 62 the Supreme Court relied on Art. 39 to decide that the law to abolish zamindari had been enacted for a 'public purpose' within the meaning of Art. 31. On the same argument, Directive Principles have also come to be regarded as relevant for considering 'reasonableness' of restrictions under Art. 19.63 A restriction promoting any of the objectives of the Directive Principles could be regarded as reasonable.64 Thus, Art. 47 which directs the state to bring about prohibition of consumption of intoxicating drinks except for medical purposes, could be taken into account while considering the reasonableness of a prohibition law under Art. 19. Art. 47 relates the idea of prohibition to public health. Therefore, to enforce prohibition effectively, the law could define the word 'liquor' broadly so as to include all alcoholic liquids which might be used as substitutes for intoxicating drinks to the detriment of health. But exemption of medicinal preparations from Art. 47 shows that prohibition of toilet and medicinal preparation containing alcohol would not be reasonable under Art. 19(6).65 In Nashirwar v. State of Madhya Pradesh, 66 the Supreme Court cited Art. 47 as one of the reasons for taking the view that the citizens have no Fundamental Right under Art. 19(1)(g) to do business in liquor. In Har Shankar v. Deputy E. and T. Commr., 67 this principle has been extended to all narcotics. Payment of the statutory minimum bonus even when the management suffers loss has been held to be reasonable and in public interest being in implementation of Arts. 39 and 43.68 Directive Principles being fundamental to the governance of the country, what is directed as state policy cannot be regarded as unreasonable or contrary to public policy.69 In Laxmi Khandsari v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 70 the Supreme Court has asserted that an important consideration which must weigh with the Courts in determining the reasonableness of a restriction is that it Page 198 should not contravene the Directive Principles. The Directive Principles aim at establishing an egalitarian society so as to bring about a welfare state and these principles should be kept in mind in judging the question as to whether or not the restrictions are reasonable vis-a-vis Art. 19. Prohibition of slaughter of cows, bulls and bullocks to enable the public to have a sufficient supply of milk, and to ensure availability of sufficient number of draught cattle for agricultural operations was held reasonable under Art. 19(6) in view of the Directive Principles contained in Arts. 47 and 48.71 The Wealth Tax Act was held reasonable in view of Art. 39(c) to prevent concentration of wealth in a few hands.72 Acquisition of agricultural land above the ceiling and its distribution among the landless fall under Arts. 39(b) and (c). Accordingly, it has been held that it is not possible to say that such a law would be outside the scope of entry 18, List II, and entry 42 in List III.73 In Welfare Assn., A.R.P. v. Ranjit P. Gohil,74 the expression \"transfer of property\" in Entry 6 and the term \"contracts\" in Entry 7 of List III were widely interpreted relying on the directive principles of State policy especially those contained in Articles 38 and 39 of the Constitution. In brief, read with various Directive Principles, Art. 21 has emerged into a multi-dimensional Fundamental Right.75 Art. 14 and Art. 39(d), read together, have led to the emergence of the principle of equal pay for equal work.76 Finally, reference may be made to Art. 31C.77 Art. 31C, as enacted in 1972, through the Constitution (Twenty-Fifth) Amendment Act sought to give primacy to Arts. 39(b)78 and (c)79 over the Fundamental Rights contained in Arts. 14, 19 and 31. The Supreme Court held the Amendment valid in the Kesavananda case.80 The Court emphasized that there is no disharmony between the Directive Principles and the Fundamental Rights as they supplement each other in aiming at the same goal of bringing about a social revolution and the establishment of a welfare state, which is envisaged in the Preamble.81 The Courts therefore have a responsibility to so interpreting the Constitution as to ensure implementation of the Directive Principles and to harmonize the social objectives underlying therein with individual rights. Justice Mathew went farthest in attributing to the Directive Principles, a significant place in the constitutional scheme. According to him: \"... In building up a just social order it is sometimes imperative that the Fundamental Rights should be subordinated to Directive Principles.... Economic goals have an uncontestable claim for priority over ideological ones on the ground that excellence comes only after existence. It is only if men exist that there can be Fundamental Rights.\" He thus came to the conclusion, as regards Art.",

    "content": "that \"if Parliament, in its capacity as an amending body, decides to amend the Constitution in such a way as to take away or abridge a Fundamental Right to give priority value to the moral claims embodied in Part IV of the Constitution [i.e., Directive Principles], the Supreme Court cannot adjudge the constitutional amendment as bad for the reason that what was intended to be subsidiary by the Constitution-makers has been made dominant.\" The next step in the direction of giving primacy to all Directive Principles over the Fundamental Rights was taken in 1976 when all Directive Principles were sought to be given precedence over Arts. 14, 19 and 31 by the 42nd Amendment.82 But the Supreme Court did not uphold this Amendment as constitutional.83 The main theme of the Court's pronouncement was that the Constitution is based on the \"bedrock of balance\" between the Directive Principles and Fundamental Rights and to give absolute primacy to one over the other would disturb this balance. Both can co-exist harmoniously. The goals set out in the Directive Principles are to be achieved without abrogating the Fundamental Rights. Both can flourish happily together. The principle was restated recently by the Supreme Court in I.R. Coelho v. State of T.N. :84 \"By enacting fundamental rights and directive principles which are negative and positive obligations of the States, the Constituent Assembly made it the responsibility of the Government to adopt a middle path between individual liberty and public good. Fundamental rights and directive principles have to be balanced. That balance can be tilted in favour of the public good. The balance, however, cannot be overturned by completely overriding individual liberty. This balance is an essential feature of the Constitution.\" Page 199 On the whole, a survey of the case law shows that the Courts have used Directive Principles not so much to restrict Fundamental Rights as to expand their scope and content. This is amply borne out by the discussion on Art. 2185 as well as the discussion below on Directive Principles. D. DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES (a) STATE The word 'state' used in these Directive Principles has the same meaning as has been given to it by Art. 12 for the purpose of enforcement of Fundamental Rights unless the context otherwise requires [ Art. 36].86 (b) SOCIAL ORDER BASED ON JUSTICE Article 38(1) directs the state to strive \"to promote the welfare of the people by securing and protecting as effectively as it may a social order in which justice, social, economic and political, shall inform all the institutions of the national life.\" Article 38 needs to be read along with Art. 14.87 This directive reaffirms what has been declared in the Preamble to the Constitution,88viz., the function of the Republic is to secure, inter alia, social, economic and political justice.89 To secure justice to the people under the law, Courts with broad powers have been established in the country.90 Article 38 envisages not only legal justice but socio-economic justice as well. The Supreme Court has explained the idea of social justice as follows:91 \"The Constitution commands justice, liberty, equality and fraternity as supreme values to usher in the egalitarian social, economic and political democracy. Social Justice, equality and dignity of person are cornerstones of social democracy. The concept of 'social justice' which the Constitution of India engrafted, consists of diverse principles essential for the orderly growth and development of personality of every citizen. 'Social Justice' is thus an integral part of justice in the generic sense. Justice is the genus, of which social justice is one of its species. Social Justice is a dynamic device to mitigate the sufferings of the poor, weak, dalits, tribals and deprived sections of the society...\" Article 38(2) directs the state to strive \"to minimise the inequalities in income,\" and endeavour \"to eliminate inequalities in status, facilities and opportunities, not only amongst individuals but also groups of people residing in different areas or engaged in different vocations\". The Supreme Court has read Arts. 19(1)(d),92 2193 and 38(2) together and has insisted that people in the hilly areas should have access to roads, as without roads their economic condition cannot improve. Under Art. 19(1)(d) every person has a right to move freely throughout India. Under Art. 21, every person has a right to his life which embraces \"not only physical existence of life but the equality of life\" and \"for residents of hilly areas, access to road is access to life itself.1 On the concept of equality envisaged by Art. 38, the Supreme Court has observed:2 \"Equality before law is a dynamic concept having many facets. One facet--the most commonly acknowledged--is that there shall be no privileged person or class and that none shall be above law. A facet which is of immediate relevance herein is the obligation upon the state to bring about, through the machinery of law, a more equal society envisaged by the Preamble and Part IV of our Constitution [viz. Directive Principles]. For, equality before law can be predicated meaningfully only in an equal society, i.e., in a society contemplated by Art. 38 of the Constitution'. The Supreme Court has pointed out that the instrument of taxation is not merely a means to raise revenue but it is also a means to reduce inequalities. Therefore, proportionately greater burden is put on the rich. The state has to use all its powers, including the power of taxation, to achieve the goal adumbrated in Art. 38. Reading Arts. 21, 38, 42, 43, 46 and 48A together, the Supreme Court has concluded in Consumer Page 200 Education & Research Centre v. Union of India, 3 that \"right to health, medical aid to protect the health and vigour of a worker while in service or post retirement is a Fundamental Right...to make the life of the workman meaningful and purposeful with dignity of person.\" In the instant case, the Supreme Court dilated upon the theme of social justice envisioned in the Preamble to the Constitution and Art. 38.",

    "content": "Social Justice is the arch of the Constitution which ensures life to be meaningful and liveable with human dignity. Social Justice, equality and dignity of the person are cornerstones of social democracy. Social Justice is a dynamic device to mitigate the sufferings of the poor, weak, dalits, tribals and the deprived sections of the society and to elevate them to the level of equality to live a life with dignity of person. The aim of social justice is to attain substantial degree of social, economic and political equality. Article 38 in Part IV is not the only Article which refers to justice, social, economic and political. Article 14 guarantees the fundamental right to equality without which there can be no justice. Other provisions of Part III also provide for political and social justice.There are often conflicting claims within the concept of \"justice, social, economic and political\". When the right of an individual to equal opportunity on the one hand had to be considered vis-a-vis preferential treatment to an individual belonging to a backward class in the matter of public employment under Articles 16(4-A) and 16(4-B), the Court upheld the classification envisaged by Articles 16(4-A) and 16(4-B).4 Health of the worker enables him to enjoy the fruit of his labour, keeping him physically fit and mentally alert for leading a successful life, economically, socially and culturally. Medical facilities to protect the health of the workers are, therefore, the fundamental and human rights of the workmen. The Supreme Court has observed that if a law is made to further socio-economic justice, it is prima facie reasonable and in public interest. In other words, if it is in negation, it is unconstitutional.5 Art. 38 is supplemented by Art. 39 which lays stress upon certain aspects of economic justice. (c) PRINCIPLES OF POLICY TO BE FOLLOWED BY THE STATE Article 39 requires the state, in particular, to direct its policy towards securing: (a) that all citizens, irrespective of sex, equally have the right to an adequate means of livelihood; (b) that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good; (c) that the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment; (d) that there is equal work for both men and women; (e) that the health and strength of workers, men and women, and tender age of children are not abused and that citizens are not forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their age or strength; (f) that children are given opportunities and facilities to develop in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity and that childhood and youth are protected against exploitation and against moral and material abandonment. (d) ART. 39(A) : MEANS OF LIVELIHOOD The Supreme Court has taken recourse to Art. 39(a) to interpret Art. 21 to include therein the \"right to livelihood.\"6 The Supreme Court has observed in Olga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corporation :7 \"If there is an obligation upon the State to secure to the citizens an adequate means of livelihood and the right to work, it would be sheer pedantry to exclude the right to livelihood from the content of the right to life.\"8 The Supreme Court has however put a rider on the right to livelihood. The state may not be compelled, by affirmative action, \"to provide adequate means of livelihood or work to the citizens.\" But the state is under a negative obligation, viz., not to deprive a person of this right without just and fair procedure. Thus, according Page 201 to the Court:9 \"But, any person, who is deprived of his right to livelihood except according to just and fair procedure established by law, can challenge the deprivation as offending the right to life conferred by Art. 21.\" For the same reason and in keeping with principles embodied in Article 39(a) it has been held that reservation for women or handicapped persons was not subject to the percentage of 50% as prescribed in Indra Sawhney v. Union of India. 10 In a major pronouncement in Madhu Kishwar v. State of Bihar, 11 with a view to protect the economic interests of tribal women depending on agriculture for their livelihood, the Supreme Court has ruled that on the death of the last male holder in an agricultural tribal family, the dependent family female members have the constitutional remedy of continuing to hold the land so long as they remain dependent on it to earn their livelihood. Otherwise, the females will be rendered destitute. It is only on the exhaustion of, or abandonment of land by such female descendants, can the males in the line of descent takeover the holding exclusively. The Court has come to this conclusion on the basis of Art. 39(a) which obligates the state to secure to all men and women equally, the right to an adequate means of livelihood. The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005, was passed with the object of giving employment to at least one member of a family for hundred days in a year, on paying wages as fixed under that Act.The Court refused to give relief by way of regularization of employment of casual workers in government service or in the service of its instrumentalities saying that in the name of individualising justice, it is not \"possible to shut our eyes to the constitutional scheme and the right of the numerous as against the few who are before the Court\". The directive principles of State policy have to be reconciled with the rights available to the citizen under Part III of the Constitution and the obligation of the State to one and all and not to a particular group of citizens.12 (e) DISTRIBUTIVE ECONOMIC SYSTEM : ARTS. 39(B) AND 39(C) Arts. 39(b) and (c) are very significant constitutional provisions as they affect the entire economic system in India.

    "content": "directive principles of State policy have to be reconciled with the rights available to the citizen under Part III of the Constitution and the obligation of the State to one and all and not to a particular group of citizens.12 (e) DISTRIBUTIVE ECONOMIC SYSTEM : ARTS. 39(B) AND 39(C) Arts. 39(b) and (c) are very significant constitutional provisions as they affect the entire economic system in India. Directive Principles contained in Arts. 39(b) and 39(c) have assumed great importance and have figured in a number of judicial pronouncements after the enactment of Art. 31C.13 Arts. 39(b) and 39(c) relate to distribution of ownership and control of material resources of the community. An Act falling under Clauses (b) and (c) of Art. 39, must have operation in the economic system and concentration of wealth. Taking over of management by the government of a sick textile mills has been characterised as being in furtherance of Arts. 39(b) and (c).14 The aim of socialism is the distribution of the material resources of the community in such a way as to subserve the common good. A socialistic state secures to its people socio-economic justice. Socialism means distributive justice-an idea ingrained in Art. 39(b). Article 39(b) contemplates measures to secure equitable distribution of community resources. Art. 39(b) does not mention either movable or immovable property. The actual expression used in Art. 39(b) is 'material resources of the community'. The term 'material resources' has been given a very broad connotation by the Supreme Court. The term is wide enough to cover not only natural or physical resources but also movable or immovable properties.15 In this connection, the Supreme Court has observed inState of Karnataka v. Ranganatha Reddy :16 \"And material resources of the community in the context of re-ordering the national economy embraces all the national wealth, not merely natural resources, all the private and public sources of meeting material needs, not merely public possessions. Every thing of value or use in the material world is material resource and the individual being a member of the community his resources are part of those of the community....\" All things which are capable of producing wealth for the community would be material resources.17 Page 202 In Sanjeev,18 the constitutional validity of the Coking Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act, 1972, and the Coal Mines (Taking Over of Management) Act, 1972, was under challenge. The Court said that when Art. 39(b) refers to material resources of the community, it does not refer only to resources owned by the community as a whole but it refers also to resources owned by individual members of the community. The expression 'material resources of the community' is not confined to natural resources; it is not confined to resources owned by the public; it means and includes all resources, natural and man-made, public and private owned. Therefore, \"all things which are capable of producing wealth for the community would be material resources.\" An Act acquiring an electricity undertaking relates to Art. 39(b) as electric energy generated by the company constitutes material resources of the community within the scope and meaning of Art. 39(b) and the object of the legislation has a direct nexus with the objective of distributing the material resources so as to subserve the common good.19 Coal is one of the most important known sources of energy and, therefore, a vital national resource.20 The word 'distribution' in Art. 39(b) has been given an expansive interpretation. It does not merely mean that the property of one should be taken over and distributed to others. This is only one mode of distribution but not the only mode. Nationalisation is also a distributive process as it prevents concentration of wealth in the hands of a few and, thus, benefits the society at large.21 \"The idea of nationalisation of a material resource of the community cannot be divorced from the idea of distribution of that resource in the community in a manner which advanced common good.\"22 What is required in terms of the constitutional scheme under Article 39of the Article 14of the Constitution of India is to make essential commodities available at a fair price.23 On Art. 39(b), the Supreme Court has observed:24 \"The principle embodied in Article 39(b) of the Constitution is one of the essential directives to bring about the distribution of the material resources. It should give full play to the distributive justice. It fulfils the basic purpose of restructuring the economic order. Article 39(b), therefore, has a social mission. It embraces the entire material resources of the community. Its task is to distribute such resources. Its goal is to undertake distribution as best to subserve the common good.\" Again, in State of Tamil Nadu v. L. Abu Kavur Bai, 25 upholding nationalisation of stage carriages, the Supreme Court has given an expansive interpretation to the word 'distribution' in Art. 39(b): \"............The word 'distribution' does not merely mean that property of one should be taken over and distributed to others like land reforms where the lands from the big landlords are taken away and given to landless labourers....That is only one of the modes of distribution but not the only mode....\" An Act nationalising sick textile mills has been held to give effect to the policy of the state underlying Art. 39(b).26Similarly, the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976, has been held to further the Directive Principles contained in Arts. 39 (b) and (c) of the Constitution.27 Again because the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act 1985 was enacted to secure the principles specified in Article 39 and seeks to give effect to the larger public interest it should be given primacy over the provisions of the Companies Act because of its higher public purpose.28 There exists a difference of judicial opinion on the question of interpretation of the words \"material resources of the community\" to be found in Art. 39(b). Some judges have favoured a broad view holding that Art.",

(f) NO CONCENTRATION OF WEALTH : ART. 39(C) Page 203 Article 39(c) contemplates measures for preventing concentration of wealth and means of production in a few private hands. The Supreme Court has explained the significance of Art. 39(c) in the following words:29 \"...Though the expression 'economic system' is used in Art. 39(c), that Article has not the object of changing the economic system generally, but is confined to only preventing concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment. What this clause envisages is that the State should secure the operation of the economic system in such a way as not to result in the concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment. Where there is already concentration of wealth and means of production which is to the common detriment, the law under Art. 39(c) would be only to break up or regulate as may be necessary the concentration of wealth and means of production.\" Article 39 also clarifies that carrying on of a trade and business is a legitimate function of the state. The task of Art. 39(b) is to distribute the material resources of the community. Measures of agrarian reform, such as, vesting of ownership of land in the tiller himself, secure the objectives mentioned in Arts. 39(b) and (c).30 A law acquiring the Madras Race Club has been held to have no relation with Arts. 39(b) and (c). The reason is that the club owns no 'material resources' which need to be distributed in terms of Art. 39(b). Also, the club has nothing to do with the operation of any \"economic system\" as is envisaged by Art. 39(c). There is no nexus between the impugned law and the objects contained in Arts. 39(b) and (c).31 Taxation of capital and wealth under entry 86, List I,32 has been characterised as an appropriate method for preventing concentration of wealth as envisaged by Art. 39(c).33A provision in the Income-tax Act authorising acquisition of property in case its value is shown less than its market value by less than 15% in the instrument of transfer has been held to have been enacted to secure the purposes of these Directive Principles.34 Arts. 39(b) and (c) do not have reference merely to acquisition of land. Their objective is to prevent concentration of wealth in any one individual. When the State takes over bus transport from private hands, the beneficial effects resulting therefrom will be passed on to the community at large and this fulfils the objectives of Arts. 39(b) and (c).35 Concentration of large blocks of land in the hands of a few individuals is contrary to Arts. 39(b) and (c). Therefore, legislation for agrarian reform and abolition of zamindari to fulfil the objectives laid down in Arts. 39(b) and (c).36 Imposing ceiling on landholdings fulfils Arts. 38 and 39.37 Article 39 also clarifies that carrying on of a trade and business is a legitimate function of the state.38 The General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Act, 1972 which nationalized the business of general insurance was enacted in order to serve better the need of the economy by securing the development of general insurance business in the best interest of the community and to ensure that the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth to the common detriment. This monopoly over the business of general insurance was ended by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority Act, 1999. Although the insurance companies are now required to compete with others in the field, but the same may not necessarily mean that the public sector insurance companies must have a level playing field with the private insurance companies. Being a State they have a different role to play. However that is not to say that as a matter of policy, statutory or otherwise, the insurance companies are bound to regulate all contracts of insurance having the statement of directive principles in mind but fairness or reasonableness on the part of the insurance companies must appear in all of its dealings.39 (g) EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK : ART. 39(D) According to Art. 39(d), the state has to ensure that there is equal pay for equal work for both men and women.40 Parliament has enacted the Equal Remuneration Act, 1976, to implement Art. 39(d). TheAct provides for Page 204 payment of equal remuneration to men and women workers for the same work, or work of a similar nature and for the prevention of discrimination on grounds of sex. The Act also ensures that there will be no discrimination against recruitment of women and provides for the setting up of advisory committees to promote employment opportunities for women. Provision is also made for appointment of officers for hearing and deciding complaints regarding contravention of the provisions of the Act. Inspectors are to be appointed for the purpose of investigating whether the provisions of the Act are being complied by the employers. Non-observance of the Act by government contractors has been held to raise questions under Art. 14.41 Besides the principle of gender equality in the matter specifically embodied in Art. 39(d), the Supreme Court has extracted the general principle of equal pay for equal work by reading Arts. 14, 16 and 39(d).42 The Supreme Court has emphasized in Randhir Singh,43 referring to Art. 39(d), that the principle of \"equal pay for equal work\" is not an abstract doctrine but one of substance. Though the principle is not expressly declared by the Constitution to be a Fundamental Right yet it may be deduced by construing Arts. 14 and 16 in the light of Art. 39(d). The word 'socialist' in the Preamble must at least mean \"equal pay for equal work\".",

    "content": "the principle is not expressly declared by the Constitution to be a Fundamental Right yet it may be deduced by construing Arts. 14 and 16 in the light of Art. 39(d). The word 'socialist' in the Preamble must at least mean \"equal pay for equal work\". The Supreme Court has observed in Grih Kalyan Kendra v. Union of India :44 \"Equal pay for equal work is not expressly declared by the Constitution as a Fundamental Right but in view of the Directive Principles of State Policy as contained in Art. 39(d) of the Constitution \"equal pay for equal work\" has assumed the status of Fundamental Right in service jurisprudence having regard to the constitutional mandate of equality in Arts. 14 and 16 of the Constitution.\" The principle of 'equal pay for equal work' may properly be applied to cases of unequal scales of pay based on no classification or irrational classification though those drawing different scales of pay do identical work under the same employer. The Supreme Court has explained the general principle as follows:45 \"We have interpreted and applied the doctrine even more widely to prevent discriminatory pay scales within an organization which is owned by or is an instrumentality of the State, provided that the different pay-scales exist in one organisation, are applied to employees doing work of equal value, and there is no rational explanation for the difference.\" As to applying the doctrine between two different organisations, the Court has warned:46 \"When the same principle is sought to be extended to compare pay-scales in one organisation with pay-scales in another organisation, although between employees doing comparable work, the stretching of the doctrine, if at all it is done, must be done with caution lest the doctrine snaps.\" The Court has held that differentiation in pay scales among government servants holding same posts and performing similar work on the basis of difference in the degree of \"responsibility, reliability and confidentiality\" would be a valid differentiation.47 As the principle of equal pay for equal work emerges out of a combined reading of Arts. 14, 16 and 39(d), whenever a question of infraction of this rule arises, \"the concept of reasonable classification and all other rules evolved with respect to Arts. 14 and 16 come into play.\"48 In pursuance of the doctrine of equal pay for equal work, the Supreme Court has ruled, inter alia, that teachers employed in aided schools be paid the same salary and dearness allowance as is paid to teachers employed in government schools.49 The Court has observed in Markandeya:50 \"The application of doctrine arises where employees are equal in every respect, in educational qualifications, duties, functions and measure of responsibilities and yet they are denied equality in pay. If the classification for prescribing different scales of pay is founded on reasonable nexus the principle will not apply.\" The state cannot deny to casual labourers at least the minimum pay in the pay-scales of regularly employed workmen. Such denial amounts to exploitation of labour which is not permissible.51 Page 205 More recently while holding that the State Government could not differentiate in the matter of pay scales between officers presiding over the Industrial Tribunal and District Judges, the Court said that although the doctrine of \"equal pay for equal work\" was originally propounded as part of the directive principles of State policy in Article 39(d), having regard to the constitutional mandate of equality and inhibition against discrimination in Articles 14 and 16, in service jurisprudence, the doctrine of \"equal pay for equal work\" has assumed the status of a fundamental right.52 (h) WELFARE OF CHILDREN : ART. 39(F) Article 39(e) prohibits the tender age of the children from being abused. Art. 39(f) ensures that the children grow in a healthy manner and are protected from exploitation. Reading Arts. 39(e) and (f) together,53 it is obvious that one of the objectives is that the state should, in particular, direct its policy towards securing that childhood and youth are protected against exploitation and against moral and material abandonment. These constitutional provisions indicate that the constitution-makers were very anxious to protect and safeguard the interests and welfare of the children. In a civilized society, the importance of a child welfare programme cannot be over-emphasized because the welfare of the entire nation depends on the well-being of its children. In pursuance of the directives contained in the constitutional provisions Arts. 39(e) and (f), the Government of India has evolved a national policy for the welfare of the children. The policy declares: \"The Nation's children are a supremely important asset\". The policy sets out measures which the Government of India seeks to adopt for the welfare of children and to protect them from cruelty and exploitation. In pursuance of Art. 39(f), the Supreme Court has directed release of all children below the age of 16 years from jails. Instead, the Supreme Court has exhorted the States to set up necessary remand homes and juvenile Courts. A child is a national asset and, therefore, \"it is the duty of the state to look after the child with a view to ensuring full development of its personality.\"54 Besides Arts. 39(e) and (f), the Constitution also incorporates a few more provisions to promote the welfare of the children. Art. 15(3)55 enables the state to make special provisions for children. Art. 23 prohibits traffic in human beings.56 Art. 24 prohibits employment of children below the age of 14 in any hazardous employment.57 Art. 21-A provides compulsory and free education for children upto the age of 14 years and Art. 45 directs the State to provide early childhood care and education for all children until the age of 6 years.58 The Supreme Court has shown concern from time to time for the welfare of the children. Several public interest litigation cases59 have been filed in the Courts raising specific problems concerning children. Reading Arts.",

    "content": "provides compulsory and free education for children upto the age of 14 years and Art. 45 directs the State to provide early childhood care and education for all children until the age of 6 years.58 The Supreme Court has shown concern from time to time for the welfare of the children. Several public interest litigation cases59 have been filed in the Courts raising specific problems concerning children. Reading Arts. 15(3), 24, 39(e) and (f), the Supreme Court has emphasized in Lakshmi Kant Pandey v. Union of India, 60 upon the great significance of child welfare in the country. According to the Supreme Court, the welfare of the entire community depends on the health and welfare of its children. Referring to the various constitutional provisions, the Court has said, \"The Constitutional provisions reflect the great anxiety of the constitution-makers to protect and safeguard the interests and welfare of children in the country.\" In the instant case, the question of adoption of Indian children by foreign parents, and the abuses arising out of the system, were brought to the notice of the Court. Bhagwati, J., delivering the opinion of the Court observed underlining upon the importance of the welfare of the children: \"It is obvious that in a civilized society the importance of child welfare cannot be over emphasized, because the welfare of the entire community, its growth and development, depend on the health and well being of its children. Children are a 'supremely important national asset and the future well being of the nation depends on how its children grow and develop.\" The Court has issued detailed guidelines to regulate adoption of Indian children by foreigners pending a law being made for the purpose by Parliament. The Court has emphasized that the primary purpose of giving the child in adoption is his own welfare, and, therefore, great care must be exercised in permitting the child to be Page 206 given in adoption to foreign parents.61 In Vishal Jeet v. Union of India, 62 the malady of child prostitution was brought to the notice of the Supreme Court through a public interest litigation writ petition. The Court expressed its anguish on the pitiable condition of child prostitutes. The Court referred to the constitutional provisions having a bearing on the problem, such as, Arts. 23, 35(a)(ii), 39(a), (e) and (f). In State of Rajasthan v. Om Prakash63, the Supreme Court referred to the \"special safeguard\" provided for children in Article 39 to caution Courts to have a sensitive approach when dealing with cases of child rape. Parliament has also enacted the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, which aims at suppressing the evil of prostitution. Parliament has also enacted the Juvenile Justice Act, 1986. In spite of these \"stringent and rehabilitative\" provisions of law, the problem still persists. The Supreme Court has therefore emphasized upon severe and speedy enforcement of these laws by the concerned law enforcement agencies. The Supreme Court has also issued several directions urging upon the various governments to take further remedial action in the matter. In Gaurav Jain v. Union of India, 64 the Court set up a committee to study the problem of rehabilitation of children of prostitutes in all its aspects. (i) BANDHUA LABOUR In Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India, 65 the Supreme Court read Art. 21 and 23 with such Directive Principles as Arts. 39(e) and (f) and Arts. 41 and 42 to secure the release of bonded labour and free them from exploitation. The Court has observed in this connection:66 \"This right to live with human dignity enshrined in Article 21 derives its life breath from the Directive Principles of State Policy and particularly Articles 41 and 42.\" It is not only the question of release of bonded labour but also of their proper rehabilitation after release. The Supreme Court has insisted upon effective rehabilitation of the freed bonded labour families. The Court has stated in this connection:67 \" Art. 42 of the Constitution makes it the obligation of the State to make provision for securing just and human conditions of work. There are several other Articles in Part IV of the Constitution (i.e., Directive Principles) which indicate that it is the State's obligation to create social atmosphere befitting human dignity for citizens to live in.\" (j) FREE LEGAL AID Article 39A obligates the state to secure that the operation of the legal system promotes justice, on a basis of equal opportunity, and shall, in particular, provide free legal aid, by suitable legislation or schemes, or in any other way, to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by reason of economic or other disabilities. Article 39A ordains the state to secure a legal system which promotes justice on the basis of equal opportunity. The language of Art. 39A is couched in mandatory terms as is clear by the use of the word 'shall' twice therein. In the words of the Delhi High Court, \"It is emphasized that the legal system should be able to deliver justice expeditiously on the basis of equal opportunity and provide free legal aid to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by reasons of economic or other disabilities.\" The Supreme Courthas commended the system of lok adalats set up by Parliament by enacting the Legal Services Authority Act, 1987. It seeks to reduce the load of cases on the civil Courts by providing an alternative dispute resolution machinery. The Court has directed that more authorities ought to set up such adalats.68 Page 207 The Act was amended in 2002, making it mandatory for the Central Authority or, as the case may be, every State Authority to establish Permanent Lok Adalats in respect of public utility services.",

    "content": "utility service\" has been defined as any--(i)transport service for the carriage of passengers or goods by air, road or water; or (ii)postal, telegraph or telephone service; or(iii)supply of power, light or water to the public by any establishment; or(iv)system of public conservancy or sanitation; or(v)service in hospital or dispensary; or (vi)insurance service, and includes any service which the Central Government or the State Government, as the case may be, may, in the public interest, by notification, declare to be a public utility service.69 Article 39A puts stress upon legal justice. Put simply, the directive requires the state to provide free legal aid to deserving people so that justice is not denied to any one merely because of economic disability. The Supreme Court has emphasized that legal assistance to a poor or indigent accused who is arrested and put in jeopardy of his life or personal liberty is a constitutional imperative mandated not only by Art. 39A but also by Arts. 14 and 21.70In the absence of legal assistance, injustice may result. Every act of injustice corrodes the foundations of democracy.71 Art 39A has been read with Art. 21 and, thus, free legal assistance at state cost has been raised to the status of a Fundamental Right of a person accused of an offence which may involve jeopardy to his life or personal liberty. The Court has also ruled that it would make a mockery of legal aid if it were to be left to a poor, ignorant and illiterate accused person to ask for free legal aid. Accordingly, the presiding Judge has been obligated to inform the accused that he can obtain free legal service at the cost of the state if he is unable to engage a lawyer because of his indigence.72 The Supreme Court has ruled that it cannot issue a writ of mandamus to enforce Art. 39A. Art. 39A makes it clear that the social objective of equal justice and free legal aid has to be implemented by suitable legislation or by formulating schemes for free legal aid.73 In fact the Legal Services Authority Act, 1987 comprehensively provides for the rendition of free legal aid at all levels. Although the mandate in Art. 39A is addressed to the legislature and the executive yet, as the Courts can indulge in some \"judicial law-making within the interstices of the Constitution or any statute before them for construction,\" the Courts too are bound by this mandate. The concept of free legal aid is broader than the legal assistance provided to a poor or indigent accused who is arrested and is put in jeopardy of his life or personal liberty. The Supreme Court has emphasized that under Art. 39A,74 the State Government undoubtedly has an obligation to set up a comprehensive and effective legal aid programme in order to ensure that the operation of the legal system promotes justice on the basis of equality. For the legal aid programme to succeed, it is necessary to involve public participation and, for this purpose, the best way is to operate through voluntary organisation and social action groups. The state should encourage and support such bodies in operating the legal aid programme.75 The Supreme Court has also stated with reference to Art. 39A that Court-fees should be correlated to expenditure on administration of justice as high Court-fees bar effective access to justice. The Supreme Court may have to consider some day whether such high Court-fees are just or legal.76 (k) VILLAGE PANCHAYATS Article 40 requires the States to take steps to organise village panchayats and to confer on them powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as units of self-government. The idea underlying this constitutional provision is to introduce democracy at the grassroots. This provision does not prescribe as to what powers should be given to the panchayats or what their structure should be and so the panchayat laws may vary from one State to another. Page 208 Article 40 does not give any guidelines for organising village panchayats. When Art. 40 speaks of village panchayats as units of self-government, it envisages the organisation of the lowest level units of self-governance in the hierarchy of self-governing, democratic, policy-making and administrative units. In the words of the Supreme Court, \"The village panchayats are envisaged by the Article as the base democratic institutions of a pyramid of the democratically organised and functioning self governing units.\" For this purpose, while organising village panchayats, it is necessary to keep in mind the following factors: (a) the village panchayats are to be the self-governing units at the lowest end of the democratic polity; (b) being self-governing units, those who are governed by them, and for whose benefit they are going to operate, will have either a direct or an elective indirect representation in them; (c) they will have an effective say in the conduct of their affairs including its plans, policies and programmes and their execution; and (d) thus they will have not only a sense and satisfaction of participation but also an experience in the governance of their own affairs. So long as the village panchayats are organised to achieve the above-mentioned objectives, the requirements of Art. 40 will be complied with both in their spirit and in letter.77 When some enterprising police officials formed a \"People's Council\" for making society a better place to live in, the Court held that the Council could not encroach on the functioning of Gram Panchayats and Panchayat Samitis but they may act in coordination with the functionaries. Similarly, the Council may, if permitted by the authorities created under the Legal Services Act, render assistance in settling disputes at Lok Adalats or for organising camps for legal literacy and the like. But they cannot be substituted for the authorities provided under the Legal Services Act.78 In this connection, reference may be made to Arts. 243 to 243O which have been enacted by Parliament to give effect to Art.",

    "content": "they cannot be substituted for the authorities provided under the Legal Services Act.78 In this connection, reference may be made to Arts. 243 to 243O which have been enacted by Parliament to give effect to Art. 40.79 (l) SOCIAL SERVICES Article 41 requires the state, within the limits of its economic capacity and development, to make effective provision for securing the right to work, to education and to public assistance in cases of unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement, and in other cases of undeserved want. In AIIMS Students' Union v. AIIMS .80 the Supreme Court noted the possible conflict between Article 46 on the one hand and Articles 41 and 47 on the other in the matter of education. Any reservation in favour of one under Article 46, to the extent of reservation is an inroad on the right of others to work and to learn under Articles 41 and 47. Article 41 does not however obligate the state to render compensation to the workers whose continuous employment suffers as a result of some governmental action, e.g. short supply of electricity.81 Art. 41 has been held to include medical education.82 The mandate is on the State to make \"effective provision\" for inter alia, education. Thus it is open to the State governments to regulate the setting up of private educational institutions having regard to the educational needs of the locality.83 Where the State made effective provision for securing the right to education by resolving to make land available at concessional rates to educational institutions, it was held that an educational institution has no legal or constitutional right to demand the allotment of any particular piece of land.84 As already stated, by reading Arts. 21, 39(a) and 41, the Supreme Court has included the right to livelihood as a part of right to life under Art. 21. This however does not mean that the state may be compelled by affirmative action to provide adequate means of livelihood or work to the citizens. The ground reality is that the number of available jobs is limited, and hence Courts must take a realistic view of the matter and must exercise self-restraint.85 But, it does certainly mean that the state shall not deprive any person of his livelihood except according to just and fair procedure established by law.86 It will thus be seen that from the traditional right to life an important economic right has been derived. This Page 209 places an obligation on the Government. But a positive obligation on the state to guarantee right to livelihood has not yet emerged. Art. 41 directs the state to make effective provision for securing the right to work but within the limits of its economic capacity and development\". Thus, even while directing the state to ensure the right to work, the constitution-makers thought it prudent to qualify it.87 A rule made by a government company authorising it to terminate the employment of a permanent employee by giving him three months' notice and without giving him a hearing has been held to be violative of Arts. 39(a) and 41 and ultra vires Art. 14.88 The Court has observed:89 \"An adequate means of livelihood cannot be secured [ Art. 39(a)] to the citizens by taking away without any reason the means of livelihood. The mode of making effective provisions for securing the right to work [ Art. 41] cannot be by giving employment to a person and then without any reason throwing him out of employment.\" The rule in question was therefore held to be contrary to the Directive Principles contained in Art. 39(a) and 41. Commenting on Art. 41, the Supreme Court has observed:90 \"This country has so far not found it feasible to incorporate the right to livelihood as a Fundamental Right in the Constitution. This is because the country has so far not attained the capacity to guarantee it, and not because it considers it any the less fundamental to life. Advisedly, therefore, it has been placed in the Chapter on Directive Principles, Article 41 of which enjoins upon the State to make effective provision for securing the same \"within the limits of its economic capacity and development.\" Thus even while giving the direction to the State to ensure the right to work, the Constitution-makers thought it prudent not to do so without qualifying it.\" (m) CONDITIONS OF WORK Article 42 requires the state to make provision for securing just and humane conditions of work and for maternity relief. Article 42 provides the basis of the large body of labour law that obtains in India. Referring to Arts. 42 and 43, the Supreme Court has emphasized that the Constitution expresses a deep concern for the welfare of the workers. The Courts may not enforce Directive Principles as such, but they must interpret laws so as to further and not hinder the goals set out in the Directive Principles.91 In D.B.M. Patnaik v. State of Andhra Pradesh, 92 the Supreme Court has suggested that Art. 42 may 'benevolently' be extended to living conditions in jails. The barbarous and subtle forms of punishment, to which convicts and undertrials are subjected to, offend against the letter and spirit of our Constitution. By reading Art. 21 along with several Directive Principles, such as, Arts. 39(e) and (f), 41 and 42, the Supreme Court has given a very broad connotation to Art. 21 so as to include therein \"the right to live with human dignity\". This concept \"derives its life breath from the Directive Principles of State Policy\".93 One of the elements promoting dignified life is the right to education. The Supreme Court in Mohini Jain94 sought to give a very broad connotation to the right to education. The Court said, \"The State is under a constitutional mandate to provide educational institutions at all levels for the benefit of the citizens.\" However, later in Unnikrishnan,95 invoking Art.",

    "content": "concept \"derives its life breath from the Directive Principles of State Policy\".93 One of the elements promoting dignified life is the right to education. The Supreme Court in Mohini Jain94 sought to give a very broad connotation to the right to education. The Court said, \"The State is under a constitutional mandate to provide educational institutions at all levels for the benefit of the citizens.\" However, later in Unnikrishnan,95 invoking Art. 45 the Supreme Court has restricted the right to education up to the age of 14 years which was adopted in Art. 21A.96 The Delhi Municipal Corporation granted maternity leave to regular female workers but denied the same to female workers on muster roll on the ground that their service not having been regularized, they were not entitled to any such leave. Invoking Art. 42, and the concept of social justice, the Supreme Court has conceded the demand of these female workers for maternity leave. The Court has emphasized that a just social order can be achieved only when inequalities are obliterated and every one is provided what is legally due.1 Page 210 (n) LIVING WAGE The Directive Principles contained in Arts. 42 and 43 show that the constitution-makers felt a deep concern for the welfare of the workers. Article 43 requires the state to endeavour to secure, by suitable legislation, or economic organisation, or in any other way, to all workers, agricultural, industrial or otherwise, work, a living wage, conditions of work ensuring a decent standard of life and full employment of leisure and social and cultural opportunities. In particular, the state is to promote cottage industries on an individual or co-operative basis in rural areas. This provision enunciates the revolutionary doctrine that employees are entitled as of right to certain reliefs.2 Thus, exemption from excise duties granted to cotton fabrics produced by co-operative societies has been held valid in terms of Art. 43.3 A 'living wage' is such wage as enables the male earner to provide for himself and his family not merely the bare essentials of food, clothing and shelter, but a measure of frugal comfort including education for children, protection against ill-health, requirements of essential social needs, and a measure of insurance against the more important misfortunes including old age. A 'minimum wage', on the other hand, is just sufficient to cover the bare physical needs of a worker and his family. Minimum wage is to be fixed in an industry irrespective of its capacity to pay. Fixation of minimum wage is in public interest and does not impose an unreasonable restriction on the right to carry on a trade guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(g).4 A 'fair wage' is a mean between 'living wage' and 'minimum wage'. 'Living' and 'fair' wages have to be fixed keeping in view the capacity of the industry to pay. Commenting on Art. 43, the Supreme Court has observed that while our political aim is 'living wage' for workers, in actual practice, this ideal has eluded our efforts so far and that our general wage structure has at best reached the lower level of 'fair wage.'5 Fixing of minimum wages under the Minimum Wages Act has been characterised as \"just the first step\" in the direction of fulfilling the mandate of Art. 43. \"In course of time, the state has to take many more steps to implement that mandate\". The mandate of the Constitution is to build a welfare society. The aspirations aroused by the Constitution will be belied if the minimum needs of the lowest of the Indian citizens are not met.6 The Supreme Court has rejected the argument that the pattern of wage fixation in case of government companies in public sector should necessarily be different from companies in private sector, arguing that Arts. 39 and 43 would be disobeyed if distinction is made between the same class of labourers on the ground that some of them are employed in state enterprises and others in private enterprises.7 Payment of a statutory minimum bonus even when the management sustains a loss is justifiable under Articles 39 and 43.8 In D.S. Nakara v. Union of India, 9 the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court has held that pension is not only compensation for loyal service rendered in the past, but also by the broader significance it is a social welfare measure rendering socio-economic justice by providing economic security in the fall of life when physical and mental prowess is ebbing corresponding to the aging process and, therefore, one is required to fall back upon savings. A scheme of pension making liberal provision for those retiring after a specified date was held to be discriminatory vis-a-vis those retiring earlier than that date. The Supreme Court invoked Arts. 14, 38(1), 39(e) and (d), 41 and 43(3), and even the word 'socialist' in the Preamble to the Constitution to reach this result. Since the advent of the Constitution, the state action is being directed towards attaining the goal of the Directive Principles so as to set up a welfare state in India. According to the Court, the principal aim of a socialist state is to eliminate inequality in income, status and standards of life. The basic framework of socialism is to provide a decent standard of life to the working people and, especially, to provide security from cradle to grave. This, amongst others on the economic side, envisages economic equality and equitable distribution of income. In the old age, socialism aims at providing an economic security to those who have rendered unto society what they were capable of doing when they were fully equipped with their mental and Page 211 physical prowess. Article 41 enjoins the state to ensure a reasonably decent standard of life, medical aid, freedom from want, freedom from fear and enjoyable leisure, relieving the boredom and the humility of dependence in the old age.",

    "content": "41 enjoins the state to ensure a reasonably decent standard of life, medical aid, freedom from want, freedom from fear and enjoyable leisure, relieving the boredom and the humility of dependence in the old age. The Court applied the liberal formula to all pensioners irrespective of the date of retirement, as distinction among pensioners with reference to a specified date was held to be discriminatory. Describing the nature of pension given to a government servant on retirement, the Court emphasized on three features thereof: (1) Pension is neither a bounty nor a matter of grace depending upon the sweet will of the employer and it creates a vested right; (2) pension is not an ex gratia payment but it is a payment for the past service rendered; and (3) it is a social welfare measure rendering socio-economic justice to those who in the hey day of their life ceaselessly toiled for the employer on an assurance that in their old age they would not be left in lurch. The proposition that the pension and gratuity are not regarded as bounty by the state but these are regarded as statutory rights has been reiterated by the Supreme Court in several cases.10 The Kerala Legislature enacted a law increasing the number of paid holidays in industrial undertakings from seven to thirteen days during a year. The reasonableness of the restriction imposed by the law was questioned vis-à-vis Art. 19(1)(g).11 In accordance with the judicial policy to take into consideration the relevant Directive Principle to assess the reasonableness of a restriction imposed on a Fundamental Right, the Court, referring to Art. 43 in the instant case, has stated that Art. 43 does not envisage that the workers should be compelled to work on all days. It is not the philosophy of Art. 43 that industrial or agricultural workers should work on all days. It is necessary that they also enjoy some holidays. As human beings, they are entitled to a period of rest which would enable them to fully enjoy their leisure and participate in social and cultural activities.12 (o) PARTICIPATION OF WORKERS IN MANAGEMENT OF INDUSTRIES Article 43A requires the state to take steps, by suitable legislation, or in any other way, to secure the participation of workers in the management of undertakings, establishments or other organisations engaged in any industry. (p) UNIFORM CIVIL CODE Article 44 requires the state to strive to secure for the citizens of India a uniform civil code throughout India. An objection was taken to this provision in the Constituent Assembly by several Muslim members who apprehended that their personal law might be abrogated. This objection was met by pointing out: (i) that India had already achieved a uniformity of law over a vast area; (ii) that though there was diversity in personal laws, there was nothing sacrosanct about them; (iii) the secular activities, such as, inheritance, covered by personal laws should be separated from religion; (iv) that a uniform law applicable to all would promote national unity; and (v) that no legislature would forcibly amend any personal law in future if people were opposed to it.13 In this connection, reference may also be made to the discussion under Art. 25 which guarantees freedom of conscience and profession, practice and propagation of religion.14 However, secular activity associated with religious practice is exempted from this guarantee. It could, therefore, plausibly be argued that personal laws pertain to secular activities and hence fall within the regulatory power of the state. Not much progress has so far been made towards achieving the ideal of a uniform civil code which still remains a distant dream. The only tangible step taken in this direction has been the codification and secularisation of Hindu Law. The codification of Muslim Law still remains a sensitive matter though enlightened Muslim opinion appears to favour such a step.15 It is necessary that law be divorced from religion. With the enactment of a uniform code, secularism will be strengthened; much of the present-day separation and divisiveness between the various religious groups in Page 212 the country will disappear, and India will emerge as a much more cohesive and integrated nation. The Supreme Court has emphasized that steps be initiated to enact a uniform civil code as envigased by Art. 44. Reviewing the various laws prevailing in the area of marriage in India, the Court has said in Ms. Jorden Diengdeh v. S.S. Chopra :16 \"... the law relating to judicial separation, divorce and nullity of marriage is far, far from uniform. Surely the time has now come for a complete reform of the law of marriage and make a uniform law applicable to all people irrespective of religion or caste.... We suggest that the time has come for the intervention of the legislature in these matters to provide for a uniform code of marriage and divorce ....\" In another case, Mohd. Ahmed Khan v. Shah Bano Begum, 17 the Supreme Court has ruled that a Muslim husband is liable to pay maintenance to the divorced wife beyond the iddat period. The Court has regretted that Art. 44 has remained a \"dead letter\" as there is \"no evidence of any official activity for framing a common civil code for the country\". The Court has emphasized: \"A common civil code will help the cause of national integration by removing disparate loyalties to laws which have conflicting ideologies\".",

    "content": "Court appreciates the difficulties involved in bringing persons of different faiths and persuasions on a common platform, but, nevertheless, the Court has said, \"a beginning has to be made if the Constitution is to have any meaning.\" \"It is the state which is charged with the duty of securing a uniform civil code for the citizens of the country and, unquestionably, it has the legislative competence to do so.\" In the absence of such a code, and the inaction of the legislatures to reform personal laws, the role of the law reformer has to be assumed by the Courts themselves because \"it is beyond the endurance of sensitive minds to allow injustice to be suffered when it is so palpable.\" To take a few examples, reference may be made in this connection to Madhu Kishwar v. State of Bihar.18 What happened in Sarla Mudgal was that a Hindu husband, married under Hindu Law, embraced Islam and solemnized second marriage. The question was whether the second marriage without the first marriage having been dissolved, would be valid qua the first wife who continued to be a Hindu. There is no general matrimonial law in India. In the instant case, the Court ruled that the second marriage of a Hindu husband after his conversion to Islam would be a void marriage in terms of S. 494,I.P.C. There have been many such cases where Hindus have converted to Islam only to escape the consequences of bigamy. It was in this context that the Court pleaded for a uniform civil code \"for protection of the oppressed and promotion of national unity and solidarity.\"19 In a public interest litigation,20 the Supreme Court was invited to declare certain aspects of Muslim Personal Law as void, e.g., polygamy etc., as being void under Arts. 14 and 15. But the Court refused to do so saying that the issues raised were fit to be dealt with by the Legislature and not the Courts. Recently, in Danial Latife v. Union of India,21 the Supreme Court has discussed the problem of a Muslim divorce woman. Liberally interpreting S. 3of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986, the Court has ruled that a Muslim husband is liable to make provision for the future of the divorced wife even after theIddat period. But such piecemeal attempts by the Courts to bridge the gap between personal laws cannot take the place of a common civil code. These problems can be eliminated only if a law is made in conformity with the present day social and economic realities. The orthodox Muslim opinion has characterised this ruling as anti-shariat while the liberal opinion accepts the ruling as progressive. The Court has again reiterated its views on the need to have a uniform Civil Code in the country. The Court has emphasized in Sarla Mudgal v. Union of India, 22 that Art. 44 is based on the concept that there is no necessary relation between religion and personal law in a civilised society. Art. 25 guarantees religious freedom whereas Art. 44 seeks to divest religion from social relations and personal law. Marriage, succession and like matters of a secular character cannot be brought within the guarantee enshrined in Arts. 25, 26 and 27. The Hindu law though of a sacramental origin has been secularised. The Court has pointed out that successive governments in India till-date have been wholly remiss in their duty of implementing the Page 213 constitutional mandate under Art. 44. Accordingly, the Court has again urged the Government of India to have a fresh look at Art. 44 and \"endeavor to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India.\" But in Lily Thomas v. Union of India, 23 clarified the remarks made by it earlier in Sarla Mudgal. The Court now asserted that it has not issued any direction in that case for the enactment of a common civil code.24 Nevertheless the Court has continued to emphasize that a common civil code will help the cause of national integration by removing the contradictions based on ideologies.25 (q) PROVISION OF FREE AND COMPULSORY EDUCATION Initially Art. 45 required the state to endeavour to provide, within a period of ten years from the commencement of the Constitution, for free and compulsory education for all children until they complete the age of fourteen years. Article 45 was substituted in 200226 when the right to free and compulsory education was made a fundamental right under 21-A.27 Art. 45 now provides that the State shall endeavour to provide early childhood care and education for all children until they complete the age of six years. The directive in Art. 45 has not been fully implemented as yet although more than 50 years have elapsed since the independence. Employment of child labour in hazardous industries, like making of fireworks, is rampant. As the Supreme Court has pointed out in M.C. Mehta v. State of Tamil Nadu :28 \".......... the stark reality is that in our country like many others, children are exploited lot. Child labour is a big problem and has remained intractable, even after about 50 years of our having become independent, despite various legislative enactments....prohibiting employment of a child in a number of occupations and avocations.\" In this connection, the Court has referred to the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986, and characterised it as ex facie a bold step. The Act bans employment of children in certain occupations and processes. In the instant case, the Court has made certain suggestions to achieve the objectives contained in Arts. 41, 45, 47, 39(e) and (6), and Art. 24. (r) PROMOTION OF EDUCATIONAL AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS OF WEAKER SECTIONS Article 46 obligates the state to promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people, and, in particular, of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, and to protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation.29 Article 46 supplements Arts.",

    "content": "45, 47, 39(e) and (6), and Art. 24. (r) PROMOTION OF EDUCATIONAL AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS OF WEAKER SECTIONS Article 46 obligates the state to promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people, and, in particular, of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, and to protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation.29 Article 46 supplements Arts. 15(2), 15(4), 16, 17 and 29(2).30 Giving of preference to a tribal over a non-tribal in the matter of granting of a liquor licence has been justified under Art. 46.31 It has been held that the state can separately categorize Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for the purpose of adequate representation in the services as Art. 46 specifies. This would not necessarily violate Arts. 14 and 16.32 Statutory provisions made to protect the holding of immoveable property by the Scheduled Castes and Tribes by resuming lands transferred by them to non-Scheduled Castes or Tribes, have been upheld having regard the Constitutional directive on the State to improve the social and economic conditions of persons belonging to weaker sections of the society. Section 51of the Transfer of Property Act, which confers protection to bona fide transferees of immoveable property, does not have any application to such cases.33 Articles 16(4-A) and 16(4-B) now empower the State to make reservations in matters of promotion and consequential seniority and to carry forward reserved vacancies in public services. The challenge to the constitutionalility of these Articles was negatived on the ground, inter alia, that the Articles have nexus with Articles 17 and 46 of the Constitution and do not obliterate equality.34 Similarly Article 15(5) introduced by the Constitution (Ninety-third Amendment) Act, 2005 empowers the State to make special provision for socially and educationally backward classes or for Scheduled Castes or Tribes with regard to their admission to educational institutions including private educational institutions.35 Page 214 In Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India36 it has been held that social empowerment is not a measure for only socially and educationally backward classes but has to be for the socially and economically backward classes. (s) DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE Out of Art. 46, the Supreme Court has developed the concept of distributive justice. Because of Art. 46, an Act made to protect and preserve the economic interests of persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and to prevent their exploitation would not infringe Art. 14.37 A rural debtor's relief Act implements Art. 46.38 An Act passed by the Maharashtra Legislature prohibiting alienation of agricultural lands by members of the Scheduled Tribes to persons not belonging to the Scheduled Tribes was held valid.39 The Act was held to be nothing but a remedial measure in keeping with the policy of the state for rendering social and economic justice to the weaker sections of the society. The Court characterised the Act as an example of distributive justice which means, inter alia, the removal of economic inequalities and rectifying the injustice resulting from dealings or transactions between unequals in society. The Court has emphasized that law should be used as an instrument of distributive justice to achieve a fair division of wealth amongst the members of the society based upon the principle: from each according to his capacity, to each according to his needs. The Court has emphasized that the Constitution not only permits but even directs the state to administer distributive justice. In the sphere of law making, this concept connotes, inter alia, the removal of economic inequalities and rectifying the injustice resulting from dealings or transactions between unequals in society. The Court has explained the concept of distributive justice as follows:40 \"Distributive justice comprehends more than achieving lessening of inequalities by differential taxation, giving debt relief or distribution of property owned by one to many who have none by imposing ceiling on holdings, both agricultural and urban, or by direct regulation of contractual transactions, by forbidding certain transactions, and, perhaps, by requiring others. It also means that those who have been deprived of their properties by unconscionable bargaining should be restored their property. All such laws may take the form of forced redistribution of wealth as a means of achieving a fair division of material resources among the members of society or there may be legislative control of unfair agreements.41 The Supreme Court has observed in the case noted below:42 \" Articles 38, 39 and 46 mandate the state, as its economic policy, to provide socio-economic justice to minimise inequalities in income and in opportunities and status. It positively charges the state to distribute its largess to the weaker sections of the society envisaged in Article 46 to make socio-economic justice a reality, meaningful and fruitful so as to make the life worth living with dignity of person and equality of status and to constantly improve excellence.\" (t) ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT Reading Arts. 14, 21, 38, 39 and 46, and the Preamble to the Constitution, the Supreme Court has also developed the doctrine of economic empowerment of the weaker sections of the society. The Court has held that the right to economic empowerment to the Dalits, Tribes and the poor is a part of distributive justice and is a Fundamental Right.43 The Court has observed in R. Chandevarappa v. State of Karnataka :44 \"The economic empowerment, therefore, to the poor, dalits and tribes is an integral constitutional scheme of socio-economic democracy is a way of life of political democracy. Economic empowerment is, therefore, a basic human right and a Fundamental Right as part of right to live, equality and of status and dignity to the poor, weaker sections, dalits and tribes\". The Court has further observed in Charan Singh v. State of Punjab :45 \"It is now settled policy of the Government as enjoined under Art. 46 of the Constitution and the Directive Principles, Page 215 particularly Arts.",

    "content": "of the Constitution and the Directive Principles, Page 215 particularly Arts. 38, 39(b) and the Preamble to the Constitution that economic and social justice requires to be done to the weaker sections of the society, in particular to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and to prevent them from social injustice and prevention of all forms of exploitation.\" In the light of this constitutional objective of economic empowerment, the government allotted land on lease to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes at a very concessional rate. After the expiry of the lease, the government sought to take possession of the land and sell it by auction. The Court ruled that the government could not sell the land after the expiry of the lease; the government ought to regularise their possession. Economic empowerment to the Dalits, Tribes and the poor as a part of distributive justice has been held to be a Fundamental Right. The state is therefore enjoined to provide adequate means of livelihood, and to distribute material resources of the community, to the poor, weaker sections of the society, the dalits and the tribes.46 (u) RAISING STANDARD OF LIVING Article 47 obligates the state to regard, as among its primary duties, the raising of the level of nutrition and the standard of living of its people and the improvement of public health. In particular, the state is to endeavour to bring about prohibition of the consumption, except for medicinal purposes, of intoxicating drinks and drugs which are injurious to health. A statute which does not make adequate provision for allowing use and consumption of intoxicating drinks for medicinal purposes goes beyond the scope of Art. 47.47 Art. 47 has helped in the crystallisation of the judicial view in favour of imposing stringent conditions on liquor trade with reference to Art. 19(6). Art. 47 was cited by the Supreme Court in Nashirwar as one of the reasons for holding that Art. 19(1)(g) does not protect the liquor trade.48 While awarding a sentence in respect of offences affecting public health, the Courts must notice the object for enacting Article 47 and deal with the offence severely.49 The Supreme Court has read Arts. 47 and 21 together and has culled out therefrom the obligation on the state to provide better health services to the poor.50 As the Supreme Court has observed in Vincent:51 \"....maintenance and improvement of public health have to rank high as these are indispensable to the very physical existence of the community and on the betterment of these depends the building of the society of which the Constitution makers envisaged. Attending to public health, in our opinion, therefore, is of high priority-- perhaps the one at the top.\" The Supreme Court has observed in Paschim Banga:52 \"... it is the constitutional obligation of the state to provide adequate medical services to the people. Whatever is necessary for this purpose has to be done.\" At another place in the same case the Court has observed: \"In a welfare state the primary duty of the Government is to secure the welfare of the people. Providing adequate medical facilities for the people is an essential part of the obligations undertaken by the Government in a welfare state. The Government discharges this obligation by running hospitals and health centres which provide medical care to the person seeking to avail of those facilities.\" The principle was extended to the issue of reservation of seats in medical colleges in AIIMS Students' Union v. AIIMS .53 The improvement of public health being one of the primary duties of the State, public health can be improved by having the best of doctors, specialists and super-specialists. Therefore a reservation in medical sciences beyond the undergraduate level is a reversion or diversion from the performance of this primary duty of the State.54Javed v. State of Haryana55 relied on the same duty to uphold a statutory provision disqualifying persons from being elected to posts in the panchayat saying that none of the goals of Article 47 can be realized without population control. The Supreme Court has brought occupational health hazards to workers within the coverage of Art. 21 by reading Arts. 21, 39(e), 41, 43, 48-A. Accordingly, right to health and medical care to protect the health and Page 216 vigour of a worker while in service or post-retirement has been held to be a Fundamental Right.56 (v) ORGANISATION OF AGRICULTURE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY Article 48 makes it obligatory on the state to endeavour to organise agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines and, in particular, to take steps for preserving and improving the breeds, and prohibiting slaughter of cows and calves and other milch and draught cattle. The Supreme Court has emphasized in Quareshi v. State of Bihar57 that in Art. 48, the directive for taking steps for preventing slaughter of certain specified categories of animals is quite explicit and positive. It is an aspect of organising animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines. The Court had opined that the directive in Art. 48 contemplates protection only of cows and calves, and other animals which are presently or potentially capable of yielding milk or doing work as draught cattle but not of cattle which, though once milch or draught, cease to be so in course of time. Art. 48 does not contemplate ban of slaughter of all types of cattle or bulls or bullocks. The state is to prohibit the slaughter of milch and draught cattle only.",

    "content": "Supreme Court has explained the scope of this Article in Quareshi as follows:58 \"....The protection recommended by this part of the directive is confined only to cows and calves and to those animals which are presently or potentially capable of yielding milk or of doing work as draught cattle but does not, from the very nature of the purpose for which it is obviously recommended, extend to cattle which at one time were milch or draught cattle but have ceased to be such...\" Thus, ban on slaughter of bulls or bullocks above the age of 16 years did not fall within Art. 48. Bulls and bullocks above the age of utility do not fall within the purview of Art. 48. This Article relates to cows and calves and other milch and draught cattle.59 Earlier the view was that a total ban on the slaughter of cows of all ages and calves of cows and calves of she-buffaloes, male and female, is quite reasonable and valid and is in consonance with this Directive Principle. In case of all other animals, ban on their slaughter can be imposed as long as they are not useful as milch and draught cattle. Beyond this, the ban cannot be regarded as reasonable.60 Overruling the earlier view, the Supreme Court in State of Gujarat v. Mirzapur Moti Kureshi Kassab Jamat61, upheld a total ban on the slaughter of the progeny of a cow. The words \"calves and other milch and draught cattle\" were construed as a matter of description of a species and not with regard to age or function and only so as to distinguish such cattle from other cattle.62 However this does not mean that laws and policies which permit such slaughter are unconstitutional.63 Therefore, the position remains that the directive principles and fundamental duties cannot in themselves serve to invalidate legislation or a policy. Article 48 has accorded recognition in somewhat 'guarded and hesitant form' to the Hindu sentiment regarding cows.64 Under Art. 48, a total ban on cow-slaughter is possible and this position has been accepted by the Supreme Court in Quareshi. While the test of usefulness has to be applied in extending protection to other animals, it is not to be applied to cows. This is criticised by many as anti-secular and uneconomic.65 A number of States have enacted laws to preserve, protect and improve livestock. The validity of some of these laws has been considered by the Courts keeping in view the exigencies of Arts. 14, 19(1)(g) and 48.66 (w) PROTECTION OF ENVIRONMENT Article 48A obligates the state to endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country. There is at present a growing consciousness and awareness that suitable measures be adopted to protect the environment, forests and wildlife. To enable effective steps being taken for the purpose, wildlife and forests have now been placed in the Concurrent List so that the Central Government may play a meaningful role in this increasingly significant area.67 The Supreme Court has clarified that whenever a problem of ecology is brought before the Court, it is bound to keep in mind Arts. 48-A and 51A(g)68 and cannot leave the matter entirely to the government. \"The least Page 217 that the Court may do is to examine whether appropriate considerations are borne in mind and irrelevance excluded. In appropriate cases, the Court may go further.\"69 In Mehta70 the Court has said : \" Articles 39(e), 47 and 48A by themselves and collectively cast a duty on the state to secure the health of the people improve public health and protect and improve the environment\". Notwithstanding adequate laws being in place, the Administration did not show much concern about environmental pollution. Accordingly, the Supreme Court has had to take an active interest in this area.71 To protect environment and ecology the court can take affirmative action by mandating the State to take action for that purpose.72 Reading Arts. 21, 47, 48A and 51A(g) together, the Supreme Court has taken an active interest in the protection of the environment. Many questions pertaining to environment and ecology have been brought before the Court by way of Public Interest Litigation.73 The Courts seek to draw a balance between preservation of the environment and sustainable development. The Courts have to adjust and reconcile between the imperatives of preservation of the environment and the development of the economy.74 Three principles, viz., \"Precautionary Principle\", the \"Polluter Pays Principle\" and the doctrine of \"public trust\"75 have been developed by the Supreme Court. It has been repeatedly held that \"natural resources including forests, water bodies, rivers, seashores, etc. are held by the State as a trustee on behalf of the people and especially the future generations. These constitute common properties and people are entitled to uninterrupted use thereof. The State cannot transfer public trust properties to a private party, if such a transfer interferes with the right of the public and the Court can invoke the public trust doctrine and take affirmative action for protecting the right\".76 In M.C. Mehta v. Union of India, 77 the Supreme Court has issued several directions in order to protect Taj Mahal from deterioration on account of environmental pollution.78 (x) PROTECTION OF MONUMENTS Article 49 directs the state to protect every monument or place or object of artistic or historic interest, declared by or under law made by Parliament to be of national importance, from spoilation, disfigurement, destruction, removal, disposal or export, as the case may be.",

    "content": "can make such a law under entry 67, List I.79 Having regard to Article 49 and Clause (g) of Article 51-A of the Constitution of India, the Supreme Court in a public interest litigation, prevented the \"Taj Heritage Corridor Project\" one of the main purposes of which was to divert the River Yamuna and to reclaim 75 acres of land between Agra Fort and the Taj Mahal, from using the reclaimed land for constructing food plazas, shops and amusement activities.80 (y) SEPARATION OF JUDICIARY FROM EXECUTIVE Article 50 is based on the bedrock of the principle of independence of the judiciary.81 It requires the state to take steps to separate the judiciary from the public services of the state. This means that there shall be a separate judicial service free of executive control. The separation of the judiciary from the executive is regarded as a very necessary element for proper administration of justice in the country. In the pre-Independence India, the criminal magistracy was under the direct control of the executive. There was a strong agitation against such a state of affairs. There was a public demand for separating the judiciary from the executive at all levels. It was vehemently argued that without such a separation, the independence of the judiciary at the lower level would be nothing more than a mockery. It is this idea which is incorporated in Art. 50. The idea underlying Art. 50 was that such an anomalous position be corrected and the judiciary be freed Page 218 from executive control. By and large this goal has been achieved.82 The Constitution makes a number of provisions to strengthen the lower judiciary and preserve its judicial independence. In course of time, the Supreme Court has interpreted these provisions so as to further enhance the prestige, dignity and independence of the subordinate judiciary.83 To promote this value, the Supreme Court has laid down that only judicial magistrates can be promoted as district Judges and the High Court Judges. An executive magistrate cannot be promoted as such.84 The Constitution also contains provisions relating to the higher judiciary, viz., the Supreme Court and the High Courts.85 Through a series of cases, the Supreme Court has interpreted these provisions so as to enhance independence and integrity of these Courts.86 Over and above all this, the Supreme Court has declared that the independence of the Judiciary is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution.87 A provision for appointing a municipal officer as a magistrate for trying offences concerning sanitation and imposing small fines is not unconstitutional although it may offend against Art. 50 in a general way.88 Similarly, merging of judicial and executive functions in village panchayats is not unconstitutional.89 These views are based on the fact that Art. 50 is directory and not mandatory. However, it needs to be emphasized that village panchayats need to be organised in such a manner that Art. 50 is vindicated rather than infringed because it contains a principle basic to the concept of rule of law.90 In Nixon M. Joseph v. Union of India, 91 a very significant question having a deep bearing on the independence of the judiciary has been raised in the Kerala High Court through a writ petition in the nature of public interest litigation. The writ petition sought a ban on the retired High Court and Supreme Court Judges from contesting elections to the legislatures and accepting appointments as commissions of inquiry. The argument was that this compromised their independence. The High Court emphasized upon the independence of the judiciary because over the years, people have come to have faith in the Judiciary as an institution which can effectively combat corruption and nepotism in high places. \"In fact it occupies an exalted position in the minds of the people as the saviour of democracy.\" In this context, emphasized the High Court, \"the principle of judicial propriety assumes vital importance.\" The High Court warned: \"The post-retirement aspirations of the Judge for personal career advancement may not be in consonance with or in the best interests of an independent judiciary.\" However, the Court left the matter for consideration to the Central Government in view of its importance and ramifications and it being a matter of national concern. Recently when the Government had appointed an Additional Judge who had not been confirmed as a Permanent Judge because of allegations of dishonesty as the President of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, the Supreme Court held that such an appointment was invalid as it would amount to interfering with the independence of the judiciary contrary to Article 50.1 In T. Fenn Walter v. Union of India,2 the Supreme Court has considered another question crucial for the maintenance of judicial independence, viz., what kind of assignments can sitting Judges of the High Courts accept without compromising their judicial independence? It is a common practice to appoint sitting High Court Judge under the commissions of Inquiry Act to head an enquiry commission. Whenever any thing goes wrong, there is often a public outcry for holding a judicial inquiry. There are many statutes enacted by Parliament which provide for a sitting High Court Judge to be appointed as President/Chairman of a tribunal or commission. Accordingly, the Supreme Court has laid down some guidelines as regards the manner in which appointment of a sitting High Court Judge to a commission is to be dealt with. A somewhat converse situation arose in Union of India v. Delhi High Court Bar Assn3. The Delhi High Courthad held that the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 was unconstitutional because it eroded the independence of the judiciary by curtailing the jurisdiction of the civil Courts and because the High Court had no role to play in the appointment of the Presiding Officers.",

    "content": "the decision theSupreme Court said that there is no reason to presume that Tribunals appointed under Articles 323-A and 323-B would not be independent or that the independence of the judiciary would stand eroded particularly when the Presiding Officers were required to be qualified to be judges and all decisions were subject to judicial review..4 Page 219 In order to maintain judicial independence, the Supreme Court has deprecated in very strong terms the attempt made by a lawyer or a litigant to brow beat the Court or malign the presiding Judge with a view to get a favourable order. The Court has said:5 \"Lawyers and litigants cannot be allowed to 'terrorize' or 'intimidate' judges with a view to 'secure' orders which they want. This is basic and fundamental and no civilized system of administration of justice can permit it.\" The power of the High Courts and the Supreme Court to punish for their contempt is also used to vindicate their independence.6 (z) PROMOTION OF INTERNATIONAL PEACE According to Art. 51, the state has to endeavour to--(a) promote international peace and security; (b) maintain just and honourable relations between nations; (c) foster respect for international law and treaty obligations in the dealings of organised peoples with one another; and (d) encourage settlement of international disputes by arbitration. This constitutional provision thus embodies the principles which the Indian foreign policy is to follow. Sikri, C.J., has observed in Kesavananda7 as regards Art. 51 as follows: \"It seems to be that, in view of Article 51 of the Constitution, this Court must interpret language of the Constitution, if not intractable, which is after all a municipal law, in the light of the United Nations Charter and the solemn declaration subscribed to by India.\" In his minority opinion in A.D.M. Jabalpur v. S. Shukla, 8 Khanna, J., observed: \"Equally well established is the rule of construction that if there be a conflict between the municipal law on one side and the international law or the provisions of any treaty obligations on the other, the Courts would give effect to municipal law. If however, two constructions of the municipal law are possible, the Courts should lean in favour of adopting such construction as would make the provisions of the municipal law to be in harmony with the international law on treaty obligations. Every statute, according to this rule is interpreted, so far as its language permits, so as not to be inconsistent with the comity of nations on the established rules of international law, and the Court will avoid a construction which would give rise to such inconsistency unless compelled to adopt it by plain and unambiguous language.\" So far as the question of legal effect of a treaty entered into by India with a foreign country is concerned, reference is to be made to Art. 2539 and the relevant entries in List I.10 The Supreme Court has accepted and incorporated provisions of International Conventions ratified by India in a growing number of situations where domestic law was silent or ambiguous.11 In State of W.B. v. Kesoram Industries Ltd12 it was said that as Article 253 contains a non obstante clause, it operates notwithstanding anything contained in Article 245 and Article 246. Article 246 confers power on Parliament to enact laws with respect to matters enumerated in List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. Entries 10 to 21 of List I of the Seventh Schedule pertain to international law. In making any law under any of these entries, Parliament is required to keep Article 51 in mind. Article 51(c) does not deal with the enforcement or implementation of treaties. Unless municipal law is changed, an international covenant does not bind. It is only the municipal law which binds the Courts.13 However, the Supreme Court has referred to several international covenants while interpreting several Fundamental Rights. For example, in People's Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of India, 14 the Court referred to Art. 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966 and Art. 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948, so as to derive from Art. 21 a right to privacy in India.15 The Court observed in this connection:16 \"International law today is not confined to regulating the relation between the States. Scope continues to extend. Today Page 220 matters of social concerns, such as, health, education and economics apart from human rights fall within the ambit of International Regulations. International Law is more than ever aimed at individuals. It is almost accepted proposition of law that the rules of customary international law which are not contrary to the municipal law shall be deemed to be incorporated in the domestic law\". E. FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES The Constitution (Forty-second) Amendment Act, 1976,17 breaks new ground by introducing the innovative concept of Fundamental Duties of the Indian citizens in the Constitution. For this purpose, a new Part IVA consisting of Art. 51A has been added to the Constitution. Art.",

    "content": "lays down the following ten fundamental duties: (a) to abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the National Flag and the National Anthem; (b) to cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our national struggle for freedom; (c) to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India; (d) to defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so; (e) to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India transcending religious, linguistic and regional diversities; to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women; (f) to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture; (g) to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife, and to have compassion for living creatures; (h) to develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of enquiry and reform; (i) to safeguard public property and to abjure violence; (j) to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement. (k) who is a parent or guardian to provide opportunities for education to his child or, as the case may be, ward between the age of six and fourteen years.18 Article 51A refers only to the Indian citizens unlike some Fundamental Rights, e.g., Arts. 14 or 21, which apply to all persons whether citizens or non-citizens.19 The various clauses of Art. 51Aexpress fine sentiments. Some of the above duties are already being enforced through ordinary law, e.g., there are laws making any activity disrupting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India illegal and penal. Article 31C20 also enables Parliament to make suitable laws to enforce some other duties, e.g. (e). But some of the other duties, mentioned above, appear to be legally unenforceable for they are vague and imprecise. For example, duties contained in (b), (f), (h) and (j) do not convey any definite ideas, or ideals nor appear to be capable of legal enforcement. These can at best be regarded as 'directory'. As regards enforceability of these duties, it has been held that these duties being duties of individual citizens cannot be enforced through mandamus,21 as they cast no public duties. The duties can be promoted by constitutional means. Art. 51A can be used to interpret ambiguous statutes.22 It is not clear whether a law made for enforcement of a basic duty can infringe a Fundamental Right or not. There is no provision clarifying the relationship between Fundamental Duties and Fundamental Rights. Perhaps, the idea is that these precepts should become a part and parcel of every Indian's thoughts and actions. During the course of discussion in Parliament, it was emphasized by the Law Minister that these duties should become a part of the educational process in the country. Recently the Supreme Court has said that fundamental duties are implicit in the concept of fundamental rights, the former providing certain restrictions on the exercise of the latter. The question of enforceability of fundamental duties thus takes a \"back seat\".23 Furthermore the Supreme Court's view in AIIMS Students' Union v. AIIMS,24 that though Article 51-A does not expressly cast any fundamental duty on the State, the duty of every citizen of India is the collective duty of the State-- its defacto enforceability in the sense that Page 221 Article 51-A is a yardstick against which the action of the State may be assessed. Thus in deciding the issue of reasonable percentage of reservation in educational institutions it was held that one of the factors to be taken into consideration would be whether the character and quantum of reservation would stall or accelerate achieving the ultimate goal of excellence enabling the nation to rise to higher levels as prescribed under Article 51-A(j).25 In fact Courts also should not pass such orders which instead of achieving the underlying spirit and objects of Part IV-A of the Constitution have the tendency to negate or destroy the same.26 Thus in considering the question of locus standito challenge the Constitutionality of provisions of the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act, 1983, the Court relied on Article 51-A(d) to say that any citizen is entitled to bring an Act made by the legislature which gives shelter and protection to illegal foreign nationals to the notice of the Court.27 In K.R.K. Vara Prasad v. Union of India28, where the High Court has said that the Constitution commands the citizens of India to follow the duties enumerated under Art. 51A. The scope of the Article was further extended in Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India29 by Bhandari, J who said \"State is all the citizens placed together and hence though Article 51-A does not expressly cast any fundamental duty on the State, the fact remains that the duty of every citizen of India is the collective duty of the State.\"30 Article 51A(a) enjoins a duty on Indian citizens to show respect to national anthem. However, so far no law has been made obliging anyone to sing the anthem. A person shows no disrespect to the National Anthem if he stands up respectfully when the National Anthem is sung but does not join in the singing.31 The Anthem is a hymn or song expressing patriotic sentiments or feelings. It is not a chronicle which defines the territory of the nation which has adopted the anthem. Therefore, there is no reason to exclude the word \"Sindh\" from the national anthem, although the province now forms part of Pakistan.32 Every citizen has the right to fly the national flag subject to the restrictions specified in Article 51-A(c).33 Reading Arts. 48A and 51A(g), it is clear that while Art. 48Aimposes a duty on the state to preserve environment34 Art. 51A(g) imposes a fundamental duty on every citizen for the same purpose. Article 51A(j) envisages that the Indian Citizens ought to perform their duties in an excellent manner and not half heartedly.",

Article 51A(j) envisages that the Indian Citizens ought to perform their duties in an excellent manner and not half heartedly. Although every citizen of India is fundamentally obligated to develop a scientific temper and humanism under Art. 51A (h)it has been held that the decision of the University Grants Commission to introduce Vedic Astrology as a part of graduation, post-graduation and PhD courses does not conflict with Art. 51-A (h).35 Article 51A-k was introduced as a Fundamental Duty in 2002 along with Art. 21A as a Fundamental right.36 Article 21-A read with Article 51-A(k) distributes an obligation amongst the State and parents: the State is concerned with free education, parents with compulsory. Notwithstanding parental duty, the State also has a role to play in ensuring that compulsory education is feasible.37 However Article 51A-(k) does not penalise parents or guardian for failing to send children to school. It is clear that of late there has been an increasing reference to Article 51-A and its various clauses giving them content and a kind of enforceability. 1. VII CAD 476, 493-4 2.

Ed: India ratified The Equal Remuneration Convention, 1951 in 1958. The Convention ensures equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of 'equal value'. Therefore jobs, which at first sight may be very different, can turn out to be of equal value when analyzed in terms of the demands made on the employee. This concept of 'equal value' requires to be considered by Courts having regard to the States obligation to give effect to a ratified Convention. See further infra. 51.

M P Jain Indian Constitutional Law/Volume 2/PART V POLITICAL AND CIVIL RIGHTS/CHAPTER XXXV SAFEGUARDS TO MINORITIES, SCHEDULED CASTES, SCHEDULED TRIBES AND BACKWARD CLASSES CHAPTER XXXV Safeguards To Minorities, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Backward classes A. GENERAL India has a composite population, having a number of groups based on religion, language, caste, ethnicity or backwardness, such as, the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Anglo-Indians, Muslims, Parsis, Sikhs, Indian Christians, etc. Page 233 The minority problem very much influenced and coloured the political life of the country before Independence. The major problem at the time was regarding the Muslim minority and this led to the partition of the country. That diluted, to some extent, the Muslim minority problem, but did not solve completely the minority problem, as such, because a number of other minority groups, as well as a large number of Muslims, are still present in the country. The framers of the Indian Constitution took care to safeguard the interests of the minorities, to give them a sense of security, to protect them against any discrimination, and to help them to get integrated in the main stream of national life.1 With this in view, a number of provisions have been incorporated in the Constitution for safeguarding specifically the social, economic and educational interests of minority groups. In addition, certain general constitutional provisions, e.g., Fundamental Rights, protect some of the rights of the minority groups. The policy of the Constitution is to do away with caste and to strive to create a casteless society. There is thus neither any safeguard to any one specifically based on caste except to the Scheduled Castes, to some extent, nor is there any discrimination against anyone on the basis of caste. Another policy-objective of the Constitution is to make the government secular. The Constitution does not recognise any religion for any kind of favoured treatment, but treats all religions alike, and protects the cultural or religious practices of all people from state interference.2 Although under Arts. 15(4) and 16(4),3 reservations can be made in educational institutions and public services for socially and educationally backward classes, no reservation or special representation has been made for these classes either in the House of the People or in the State Legislative Assemblies.4 The Constitution does not define the term 'Minority'. The Constitution uses the term 'minority' only twice. Once in the marginal note to Art. 29, but in the text of the Article the expression used is \"Any section of the citizens.... having a distinct language, script or culture of its own....\"5 The emphasis of Art. 29, thus, is on linguistic and cultural minorities. Again, in Art 30, the expression used is \"All minorities, whether based on religion or language....\" Art. 30 thus refers to linguistic or religious minorities.6 The National Minorities Commission7 treats Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Zoroastrians as religious minorities at the national level because their numerical strength as compared with the rest of the Indian citizens is smaller. (a) FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS A wide range of minority rights are covered by the provisions relating to the Fundamental Rights. Arts. 148, 15,9 16,10 25,11 2612 and 29(2)13 seek to protect them from hostile and discriminatory State action. Arts. 15(2),(4),(5)14, 16(3),(4),(4A),(4B)15, 1716, 2317 and 25(2)(b)18 seek to remove social and economic disabilities of the depressed classes of people. Arts. 25 to 30 safeguard religion and culture of minority groups in India.19 (b) DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES Besides the Fundamental Rights, certain Directive Principles obligate the State to ensure the welfare of certain sections of the people.20 Article 46 requires the state to take special care in promoting educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people, and, in particular, of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.21 Article 38 requires the state to promote the welfare of the people by securing a social order based on justice.22 (c) ELECTIONS According to Art. 325, there is to be only one general electoral roll and no person is ineligible for being included therein on the ground only of religion, race, caste or sex.23 Thus, all discrimination is barred in Page 234 matters of election. Adult suffrage also strengthens the political position of the minorities as the political parties constantly vie with each other to woo them. The purpose of all the provisions, mentioned above, is to integrate the minorities into one mainstream of national life and thus keep in check the divisive forces which may otherwise be released by the existence of several minority groups. The Constitution while extending safeguards to minorities also seeks to weld and integrate the diverse elements into one political and national life. That is why the system of separate electorates was not adopted and elections to all legislatures are held on the basis of joint electorates.24 Besides the above, there are some other constitutional provisions directed towards specific groups of people, and conferring benefits on them. B. SCHEDULED CASTES The Constitution treats the Scheduled Castes in India with special favour and affords them with some valuable safeguards. Arts. 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution confer several benefits of social and economic advancement and empowerment and social equality of status and dignity of person, by providing reservation in government services and in educational institutions for the Scheduled Castes and Schedule Tribes.25 The Scheduled Castes are not, strictly speaking, a racial, linguistic or religious minority. They are part and parcel of the Hindu society. They are the depressed sections of the Hindus who have suffered for long under social handicaps and thus need special protection and help for the amelioration of their social, economic and political conditions.",

    "content": "are part and parcel of the Hindu society. They are the depressed sections of the Hindus who have suffered for long under social handicaps and thus need special protection and help for the amelioration of their social, economic and political conditions. They are known as untouchables or Harijans and constitute nearly 15 per cent of the Indian population. They usually engage themselves in the so-called dirty jobs like tanning and skinning of hides, manufacture of leather goods, sweeping of streets, scavenging, etc. Even amongst the Harijans, there are high and low, at the lowest rung of the ladder being the bhangi. The framers of the Constitution were determined to eradicate the scourge of untouchability. With this in view, Art. 17 abolishes untouchability26 and Art. 25(2)(b) provides for opening of Hindu temples to the Harijans.27 To promote their educational and economic interests, Arts. 15(4) &(5) and 16 provide for reservation of seats for them in educational institutions and in government services.28 C. SCHEDULED TRIBES The Scheduled Tribes [S/T], also known as aborigines, are those backward sections of the Indian population who still observe their tribal ways, their own peculiar customs and cultural norms. The tribal people have remained backward because of the fact that they live in inaccessible forests and hilly regions and have thus been cut off from the main currents of national life. These people are divided into four distinct zones--North, Eastern, Central and Southern. The three main characteristics of these people are their primitive way of living, nomadic habits, love for drink and dance and habitation in remote and inaccessible areas.29 They constitute nearly 7.5 per cent of the country's total population. The Constitution enjoins to provide facilities and opportunities for development of tribal economic and educational standards. The Scheduled Tribes also need special provisions for safeguarding their interests. The main problem concerning these people is that their socio-economic conditions be improved at such a pace and in such a way as not to disturb suddenly their social organisation and way of living. The need is to evolve ways and means to gradually adjust the tribal population to changed conditions, and integrate them slowly in the general life of the country without undue and hasty disruption of their way of living. It has been thought that it may be harmful to the tribal people if they are brought into indiscriminate contact with the outside world. Thus, the Legislatures have been empowered to impose restrictions on the Page 235 Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Arts. 19(1)(d), 19(1)(e) and 19(1)(f) in the interests of the Scheduled Tribes,30 in order that movement of people from developed areas to tribal areas may be restricted so that the tribal people are not exploited by outsiders. Laws have, therefore, been enacted prohibiting the entry of non-tribals into the tribal areas without permits, living of non-tribals permanently in tribal areas, and transfer of tribal land to non-tribals. Further, to protect the interests of the tribal people who are simple and less-politically conscious, separate provisions have been made for the administration of the tribal areas.31 Reservation of seats can also be made for them in educational institutions and government services under Arts. 15(4),(5), 16(4), 41, 46 and 335.32 (a) IDENTIFICATION OF S/Cs AND S/Ts The Constitution does not specify the castes or the tribes which are to be called as the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes. It leaves the power to list these castes and tribes to the President, i.e., the Central Executive. Scheduled Castes, according to Art. 366(24) read with Art. 341, are those castes, races or tribes, or parts thereof, as the President may notify. According to Art. 341(1), the President may by public notification specify what castes, races or tribes, or groups thereof in each State and Union Territory would be regarded as the Scheduled Castes for the purposes of the Constitution in relation to that State or Union Territory. Thus, the lists of the Scheduled Castes may vary from State to State and one Union Territory to another. As regards the States, the President issues the notification after consultation with the Governor of the State concerned. The purpose of this provision is to avoid disputes as to whether a particular caste, race or tribe should be specified as a Scheduled Caste or not. Only those castes, races or tribes can be characterised as Scheduled Castes which are notified in the Presidential Order under Art. 341. To determine whether or not a particular caste, race or tribe is a Scheduled Caste or not in a State, one has to look only at the notification issued by the President under Art. 341.33 The Supreme Court has expressed in Milind34 that the words \"castes\" or \"tribes\" in the expression \"Scheduled Castes\" and \"Scheduled Tribes\" have not been used in the ordinary sense of the terms but are used in the sense of the definitions contained in Arts. 366(24) and 366(25). In this view, a caste is a \"Scheduled Caste\" or a tribe is a \"Scheduled Tribe\" only if they are included in the President's Orders issued under Arts. 341 and 342. It has been held that a person belong to S/C in one State cannot be deemed to be so in relation to any other State to which he migrates for the purpose of employment or education. Lists of S/Cs are declared in relation to each State separately.35 Under Art. 341(2), however, once the notification is issued by the President under Art. 341(1), any modifications therein, by way either of including or excluding from the list any caste, race or tribe or a part or a group thereof, can be made by Parliament by law and not by a Presidential notification. This means that the entries in the Presidential notification issued under Art.",

    "content": "means that the entries in the Presidential notification issued under Art. 341(1) have to be taken as final unless altered by Parliament by law.36 The Constitutional mandate thus is that it is the President who is empowered, in consultation with the Governor of the State, to specify by a public notification the castes, races or tribes or parts or groups within castes, races and tribes which shall, for the purposes of the Constitution, be deemed to be Scheduled Castes in relation to that State. It is not open to any one to include any caste as coming within the notification on the basis of evidence--oral or documentary--if the caste in question is not specifically mentioned in the notification. It is therefore not possible to give evidence that a particular caste is a Scheduled Caste even though not mentioned in the Presidential Order.37 Even the court cannot modify, add or subtract any entry in the Presidential Order. The function of the court is to interpret what an entry in the PO is intended to mean.37 In Pankaj,38 the Supreme Court has observed : Page 236 \"It is now settled law that....the Court is devoid of power to include or exclude from or substitute or declare synonyms to be a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe.\" It is for Parliament to amend the list and include therein, or exclude therefrom, any caste, race or tribe. The purpose of Art. 341(1) is to avoid all disputes as to whether a particular caste is a Scheduled Caste or not for purposes of the Constitution. It is the President's notification issued under Art. 341(1), which determines whether a particular caste is a Scheduled Caste or not.39 If a particular caste is not mentioned in the Presidential Order, it cannot be characterised as a Scheduled Caste.40 Only those castes can be regarded as Scheduled Castes which are notified in the PO made under Art. 341. The Supreme Court has observed as regards the President's power under Art. 341:41 \"It is obvious that in specifying castes, races or tribes, the President has been expressly authorised to limit the notification to parts of or groups within the castes, races or tribes, and that must mean that after examining the educational and social backwardness of a caste, race or tribe, the President may well come to the conclusion that not the whole caste, race or tribe, but parts of or groups within them would be specified. Similarly, the President can specify castes, races or tribes or parts thereof in relation not only to the entire State, but in relation to parts of the State where he is satisfied that the examination of the social and educational backwardness of the race, caste or tribe justifies such specification. In fact, it is well known that before a notification is issued under Art. 341(1), an elaborate enquiry is made and it is as a result of this inquiry that social justice is sought to be done to the castes, races or tribes as may appear to be necessary, and in doing justice, it would obviously be expedient not only to specify parts or groups of castes, races or tribes, but to make the said specification by reference to different areas in the State. Educational and social backwardness in regard to these castes, races or tribes may not be uniform or of the same intensity in the whole of the State; it may vary in degree or in kind in different areas and may justify the division of the Sate into convenient and suitable areas for the purpose of issuing the public notification in question.\" Similarly, Scheduled Tribes, according to Art. 366(25) read with Art. 342, are those tribes or tribal communities, or parts or groups thereof, as the President my notify. The President may specify under Art. 342(1) by public notification what tribes or tribal communities are to be treated as the Scheduled Tribes with respect to each State and Union Territory. A person belonging to a Scheduled Tribe in one State cannot ipso facto claim the same status in another State unless his tribe is declared to be a Scheduled Tribe in relation to that State.42 In case of the States, the President issues the notification after consulting the Governor of the State concerned. There is no uniform test for classifying the tribes as the Scheduled Tribes and, therefore, there exist difficulties in determining which tribe can rightly be included in, or excluded from, the schedule of tribes. Once these lists have been issued by the President, any later additions or subtractions can be made therein only by a law of Parliament and not by a Presidential notification [ Art. 342(2)]. Clarifying the position in this regard, the Supreme Court has observed in State of Maharashtra v. Milind43 that the Scheduled Tribes Order must be read as it is. It is not even permissible to say that a tribe, sub-tribe, part or group of any tribe or tribal community is synonymous to the one mentioned in the order if they are not so specifically mentioned in it. It is also not at all permissible to hold any enquiry or let in any evidence to decide or declare that any tribe or tribal community or part of or group within any tribe or tribal community is included in the general name even though it is not specifically mentioned in the concerned entry in the said order.44 Under the above-mentioned provisions, the President promulgated a number of orders listing the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, i.e., The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950;45 The Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950;41 The Constitution (Scheduled Castes--Part C States) Order, 1951, and The Constitution (Scheduled Tribes--Part C States) Order, 1951. As stated above, once these orders have been issued by the President, no other authority except Parliament, that too by passing a law, can amend these orders.",

    "content": "stated above, once these orders have been issued by the President, no other authority except Parliament, that too by passing a law, can amend these orders. These orders did not give entire satisfaction to the people and the Central Government received a number of requests for revision and modification of the lists contained in these orders. The Central Government referred all these requests to the Backward Classes Commission.46On the recommendation of the Commission, Parliament modified the Presidential Orders by enacting the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Order Page 237 (Amendment) Act, 1956. After the re-organisation of the States on a linguistic basis in 1957,47 a new Presidential Order was issued under the States' Re-organisation Act. Besides, various other orders have been issued mainly for the Union Territories. The Scheduled Castes & Tribes Orders of 1950 have been further modified by the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Orders (Amendment) Act, 1976. The Supreme Court has stated in Ganesh v. State of Maharashtra48 : \"The notification of the President under Art. 342 of the Constitution, subject to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Act, 1976, is conclusive and final.\" Similarly \"by virtue of Article 341, the Presidential orders made under Clause (1) thereof acquire an overriding status. But for Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution, it would have been possible for both the Union and the States, to legislate upon, or frame policies, concerning the subject of reservation, vis--vis inclusion of Castes/Tribes. The presence of Articles 338, 338A, 341, 342 in the Constitution clearly preclude that\".49 The Andhra Pradesh Scheduled Castes (Rationalisation of Reservations) Act, 2000 regrouped the 59 castes found in the Presidential List into 4 separate groups and allotted them different percentage out of the total reservation made for Scheduled Castes as a class. Striking down the Act as unconstitutional,50 the Supreme Court said that the State cannot claim legislative power to make a law dividing the Scheduled Castes List of the State by tracing its legislative competence to Entry 41 of List II or Entry 25 of List III nor could the principles laid down in Indra Sawhney case51 for sub-classification of Other Backward Classes be applied as a precedent for sub-classification or sub-grouping Scheduled Castes in the Presidential List. If they are one class under the Constitution, any division of these classes of persons based on any consideration would, apart from being violative of Article 14 of the Constitution, amount to tinkering with the Presidential List and therefore be unconstitutional.52 In Subhash Chandra v. Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board53 the Supreme Court clarified that there exists a distinction between State Service and State run institutions including Union Territory Services and Union Territory run institutions on the one hand, and the Central Civil Services and the institutions run by the Central Government on the other. In the case of the former, the reservation whether for admission or appointment in an institution and employment or appointment in the services or posts in a State or Union Territory must be confined to the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes as notified in the Presidential Orders. But in respect of All India Services, Central Civil Services or admission to an institution run and founded by the Central Government, the members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and other reserved category candidates irrespective of their State for which they have been notified are entitled to the benefits thereof. Clause 3 of the Scheduled Castes Order, 1950, originally declared that \"....no person who professes a religion different from Hindusim\" would be deemed to be a member of a Scheduled Caste. This para was substituted by the following para of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Orders (Amendment) Act, 1956 : \"....no person who professes a religion different from the Hindu or the Sikh religion shall be deemed to be a member of a Scheduled Caste\". This provision has created some difficulty as is illustrated by Punjabrao v. Meshram, 54 The Supreme Court held in the instant case that under cl. 3 of the Order, only a person professing the Hindu or Sikh religion could belong to a Scheduled Caste, and a person who became a Buddhist and declared that he had ceased to be a Hindu could not derive any benefit from the Order. He could not thus contest election from a constituency reserved for members of the Scheduled Castes. To undo the effect of this ruling, the Scheduled Castes order, 1950, has been amended by the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Orders (Amendment) Act, 1990 which adds the word \"Buddhist\" after \"the Sikh\" in cl. 3. This means that a scheduled caste person professing the Buddhist religion does not cease to be a scheduled caste.55 This Amendment shows that change of religion does not alter the social and economic conditions of the Scheduled Castes. In Soosai v. Union of India, 56 the Supreme Court has posed the following important question: Page 238 \"Whether a Hindu belonging to a Scheduled Caste retains his caste on conversion to Christianity\"? The question becomes relevant to decide whether certain facilities granted to the Scheduled Castes can be denied to a scheduled caste person on changing his religion from Hinduism to another religion. Will this denial amount to discrimination on the ground of 'religion' only and thus be violative of Arts. 14 and 15(1) of the Constitution? In Soosai the constitutional validity of para 3, mentioned above, was challenged under Art. 14 and Art. 15(I) as being discriminatory on the basis of religion. In its judgment (delivered by Pathak, J.), the Court has accepted that \"caste was retained on conversion from one religion to another\",57 but the Court has also observed that such an oppressed group of people was part of the Hindu society alone.",

    "content": "and Art. 15(I) as being discriminatory on the basis of religion. In its judgment (delivered by Pathak, J.), the Court has accepted that \"caste was retained on conversion from one religion to another\",57 but the Court has also observed that such an oppressed group of people was part of the Hindu society alone. The Court insisted that to sustain discrimination the petitioner must prove that the disabilities and handicaps suffered from such caste membership in the social order of its origin--Hinduism--continue in their oppressive severity in the new environment of a different religious community as well. In the words of the Court : \"To establish that paragraph 3 of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 discriminates against Christian members of the enumerated castes it must be shown that they suffer from a comparable depth of social and economic disabilities and cultural and educational backwardness and similar levels of degradation within the Christian community necessitating intervention by the State under the provisions of the Constitution. It is not sufficient to show that the same caste continues after conversion. It is necessary to establish further that the disabilities and handicaps suffered from such caste membership in the social order of its origin--Hinduism continue in their oppressive severity in the new environment of a different religion community\" In the instant case, no authoritative and detailed dealing with the present conditions of Christian society had been placed before the Court. Accordingly, the Court refused to hold that the President acted arbitrarily in the exercise of his judgment in enacting paragraph 3 of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950. The Court asserted that it is well established that when violation of Art. 14 or any of its related provisions, is alleged, the burden rests on the petitioner to establish by clear and cogent evidence that the state has been guilty of arbitrary discrimination. In the instant case, the petitioner had failed to establish his case.58 The Supreme Court has also considered another interesting question: when a member of a Scheduled Caste is converted to Christianity and, thereafter, is reconverted to Hinduism, what is his status? The Court has held that reconversion would not entitle him to be automatically treaded as belonging to his original caste, before conversion; he would belong to his original caste if the members of the caste accept him as a member. The caste is a \"social combination of persons governed by its rules and regulations,\" and it may admit a new member just as it can expel an existing member.59 The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court has observed on this point in Guntur Medical College60: \"....on conversion to Hinduism, a person born of Christian converts would not become a member of the caste to which his parents belonged prior to their conversion to Christianity, automatically or as a matter of course, but would become such member if the other members of the caste accept him as a member and admit him within the fold.\" The Supreme Court has held that a woman when married to a member of a tribe, after due observance of all formalities and after getting the approval of the elders of the tribe, would be regarded as a member of the tribe to which her husband belongs on the analogy of the wife taking the husband's domicile. In the instant case,61 the husband belonged to the Munda Tribe. His wife sought to contest for a seat in the Lok Sabha from a reserved tribal constituency. It was argued against her that as she was not a member of the Scheduled Tribe, she was not eligible to contest from the reserved seat. The Supreme Court however ruled that as she was duly married to a person from the Munda Tribe, she acquired membership of that tribe. However, more recently the Supreme Court has held that62 a woman belonging to a Forward Class marrying a tribal cannot automatically attain the status of tribal unless she has been accepted by the community as one of them, observed all rituals, customs and traditions which have been practised by the tribals from time Page 239 immemorial and accepted by the community of the village as a member of tribal society. Such acceptance must be by a resolution of the village community which must be entered in the Village Register kept for the purpose. In any event the off-spring of such a marriage would be tribal. On the other hand if a non-tribal man marries a tribal woman, their off-spring would not be tribal.63 Further, conversion of the parents does not automatically affect the tribal status of the child.64 A member of a Scheduled Tribe in one State, on migration to another State, does not carry with him the tribal status if his Tribe is not recognised as such in the other State. Each State has its own list of Tribes [see Art. 342].65 In the instant case,66 the petitioner belonged to a Scheduled Tribe in Andhra Pradesh. He migrated to Maharashtra where his Tribe was not listed as a Scheduled Tribe. The Supreme Court ruled that be could not be treated as a member of the Schedule Tribe in Maharashtra though he would be one in Andhra Pradesh. The Court ruled that under Art. 342, the Scheduled Tribes are specified in relation to each State and Union Territory and, therefore, a member of a Scheduled Tribe in one State does not carry that status to another State. But when an area dominated by members of the same tribe belonging to the same region has been bifurcated between two States, the members would continue to get the same benefit when the said tribe is recognized in both the States.67 This interpretation of Art. 342 is in line with the interpretation of Art. 341 as mentioned above.68 A person belonging to a forward class cannot claim the status of a S/T by obtaining a false certificate to that effect for purposes of admission to an educational institution.69 (b) CONSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARDS Under Art.",

Originally, this reservation was to operate for ten years from the commencement of the Constitution. But this duration has been extended continuously since then by 10 years each time. Now, under the Amendment of the Constitution, enacted in 1999, this reservation is to last until January 25, 2010 [ Art. 334(a)]70. It is felt that the handicaps and disabilities under which these people live have not yet been removed and that they need this reservation for some time more so that their condition may be ameliorated and they may catch up with the rest of the nation. The reservation for Lok Sabha seats for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes has to be made in each State and Union Territory on population basis. The number of Lok Sabha seats reserved in a State or Union Territory for such Castes and Tribes is to bear, as nearly as possible, the same proportion to the total number of seats allotted to that State or Union Territory in the Lok Sabha as the population of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (excluding the Scheduled Tribes in the autonomous districts of Assam)71 in the concerned State or the Union Territory bears to the total population of the State or the Union Territory [ Art. 330(2)]. Similarly, under Art. 332(1), seats are to be reserved for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (excluding the tribes in the autonomous districts of Assam)72 in the State Legislative Assemblies. Under Art. 334(a), this reservation is to operate until January 25, 2010.73 The seats reserved for such Castes and Tribes in a State Legislative Assembly are to bear, as nearly as possible, the same proportion to the total number of seats in the Assembly as the population of such Castes and Tribes in the State bears to the total State population.74 By the 42nd Amendment of the Constitution, the number of seats for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in Lok Sabha and the State Legislative Assemblies were frozen at the level of the 1971 census population figures and this number will not be varied until the first census held after the year 2000.75 A new Constitutional Amendment has now been passed to freeze the seats in the Lok Sabha and State Legislature, at the 2001 census level until the year 2026.76 Article 243-T of the Constitution provides for reservation of seats for the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and women in every municipality and further enables the legislature of a State to make provision for reservation of seats in any municipality or offices of the Chairpersons in the municipalities in favour of Backward Class of citizens. It also mandates that the offices of Chairpersons in the municipalities shall be Page 240 reserved for the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and women as the legislature of a State may, by law, provide. Elections to the reserved seats are held on the basis of a single electoral roll, and each voter in the reserved constituency is entitled to vote. There is no separate electorate. It is not for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes alone to elect their representatives. Thus, to elect a person belonging to such Castes and Tribes to a reserved seat, all the voters in the constituency have a right to vote. This method has been adopted with a view to discourage the differentiation of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes from other people and to gradually integrate them in the main stream of national life. Also, a member of the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes is not debarred from contesting a general non-reserved seat.77 The fact that reservation of seats in the Legislatures is not on a permanent basis, but is at present provided for a 10 year period at a time, shows that it is envisaged that the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes would ultimately assimilate themselves fully in the political and national life of the country so much so that there would be no need for any special safeguards for them and that there would be no need to draw a distinction between one citizen and another. Their condition would improve so much that they would feel that their interests are secure without any kind of reservation. (c) CONSIDERATIONS OF EFFICIENCY The general principle adopted as regards government service is merit, but in case of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, some relaxation is needed because of their backwardness. Art. 335, therefore, provides that the claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes are to be taken into consideration, consistently with the maintenance of efficiency of administration, in making appointments to services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of a State. This provision thus imposes a constitutional obligation on the various governments to take steps to ensure that the claims of members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are duly considered in making appointments to government services. In this connection, reference may be made to the discussion under Arts. 16(1) and 16(4).78 Art. 16(4) is an enabling provision conferring power on the State to make reservation of posts in favour of any backward class of citizens who, in the opinion of the State Government, are not adequately represented in the State services. In this connection, reference may also be made to Art.",

    "content": "this connection, reference may also be made to Art. 46, a Directive Principle.79 Article 335 runs follows : \"The claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes shall be taken into consideration, consistently with the maintenance of efficiency of administration, in the making of appointments to services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of a State.\" Article 335 insists on drawing a balance between reservation of posts for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in government posts and maintenance of efficiency in the administration. Art. 335 makes efficiency in administration of paramount importance. Art. 335 makes efficiency in administration an express constitutional limitation upon the discretion vested in the state while making provisions for adequate representation for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.80 As the Supreme Court has stated in Indra Sawhney,81 the provisions of the Constitution must be interpreted in such a manner that a sense of competition is cultivated among all service personnel, including the reserved category. The Supreme Court has observed in this connection:82 \" Art. 335 stipulates that the claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes shall be taken into consideration, consistent with the maintenance of efficiency of administration, in the making of appointment to services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of the State. It is thus, apparent that even in the matter of reservation in favour of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes the founding fathers of the Constitution did make a provision relating to the maintenance of efficiency of administration. In this view of the matter if any statutory provision provides for recruitment of a candidate without bearing in mind the maintenance of efficiency of administration such a Page 241 provision cannot be sustained, being against the constitutional mandate\". Whether a particular class is adequately represented in the State services or not is a matter which lies within the subjective satisfaction of the concerned government. Although not stated specifically in the Constitution, the same principle of efficiency of administration83 is to apply to reservation of posts for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) as well.84 (d) ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS FOR SCHEDULED TRIBES The Constitution provides for the appointment of a Minister for Tribal Welfare in each of the States of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Orissa. This Minister can also be put additionally in charge of the welfare of the Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes, or any other work [proviso to Art. 164(1)].85 Under Art. 339(1), the President may appoint a Commission at any time, and must appoint it after ten years of the commencement of the Constitution, to report on the welfare of the Scheduled Tribes in the States and the administration of the Scheduled Areas. The Presidential Order appointing the Commission may define its composition, powers and procedure and may make other incidental or ancillary provisions. No such provision has been made in the Constitution as regards the Scheduled Castes. Article 339(2) empowers the Centre to issue directives to any State giving directions as to the drawing up and execution of schemes specified in the directives to be essential for the welfare of the Scheduled Tribes in the State. Art. 339(2) is supplementary to Art. 275(1)86 which provides, inter alia, that grants-in-aid shall be payable to a State out of the Consolidated Fund of India for purposes of meeting costs of such schemes of developments as the State may undertake with the approval of the Government of India for promoting the welfare of the Scheduled Tribes in that State. Thus, Art. 275(1) furnishes the raison d'etre of Art. 339. The Central Government has been given the power to give directions as respects such schemes because it pays the cost thereof. There are special provisions made for administration of the areas known as the Scheduled Areas [Schedules V & VI to the Constitution] which have already been discussed earlier in this book.87 The main problem with the Scheduled Tribes is to improve their socio-economic condition not at a very quick pace, but in such a way as not to do violence to their social organisation and way of life. The need is to evolve ways and means of gradual adjustment of the tribal population to the changed conditions, and their slow integration in the general life of the country without undue and hasty disruption of their way of living. It has been thought that it may be harmful to the tribal people if they are brought in indiscriminate contact with the outside world. Thus, the legislatures have been empowered to impose restrictions on the Fundamental Rights of other citizens guaranteed by Arts. 19(1)(d) and 19(1)(e) in the interest of the Scheduled Tribes,88 so that movement of people from the progressive to the tribal areas, may be restricted. Accordingly, to check exploitation of the tribals, many States have enacted laws prohibiting non-tribals into the tribal areas without permits, living of non-tribals permanently in tribal areas and the transfer of tribal land to non-tribals. Reservations can also be made for them in educational institutions and government services under Arts. 15(4),(5) and 16(4). (e) THE SCHEDULED CASTES AND THE SCHEDULED TRIBES (PREVENTION OF ATROCITIES) ACT, 1989. Parliament has enacted the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The underlying purpose of the Act is to prevent the commission of offences of atrocities against the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, to establish special courts for the trial of such offences and to provide for the relief and rehabilitation of the victims of such offences. Section 3(1) of the Act contains a list of such acts as fall within the category of atrocity. These acts have been made punishable with imprisonment for a term of six months to five years and with fine.",

These acts have been made punishable with imprisonment for a term of six months to five years and with fine. Page 242 Section 3(2) lists certain other acts, such as, giving of false evidence against a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe to implicate him in a criminal offence, which have also been made punishable. Provision has been made [ s. 14] for designating special courts for the purpose of providing for speedy trial of offences under the Act. Provision has also been made for imposing collective fines [ s. 16]. Provisions of this Act override the provisions of any other Act [ s. 20]. Every year the Central Government has to lay on the table of each House of Parliament a report on the measures taken by itself and the State Governments in pursuance of this Act [ s. 21(4)]. The State Governments are required to make provision for the economic and social rehabilitation of the victims of atrocities, and provide them legal aid [ s. 21]. Reference has already been made to the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955.89 D. ANGLO-INDIANS The Constitution contains some special provisions safeguarding the interests of the Anglo-Indian community. Anglo-Indians constitute a religious, social, as well as a linguistic minority. An Anglo-Indian, according to Article 366(2), is a person whose father, or any of whose other male progenitors in the male line, is or was of European descent but who is domiciled within the territory of India and is or was born within such territory of parents habitually resident therein and not established there for temporary purposes only. The President, if he is of opinion that the Anglo-Indian community is not adequately represented in the Lok Sabha, may nominate thereto not more than two members of the community [ Art. 331].90 Similarly, the Governor of a State, if he is of opinion that the Anglo-Indian community needs representation in the State Legislative Assembly, and is not adequately represented there, may nominate one member of the community to the Assembly [ Art. 333].91 These provisions were necessary, for, otherwise, being numerically an extremely small community, and being interspersed all over India, the Anglo-Indians could not hope to get any seat in any Legislature through election. The concession shown to the Anglo-Indians by way of providing for their representation in the Lok Sabha and the State Legislative Assemblies is to last for the present up to the 25th January, 2010 [ Art. 334(b)]. Before Independence, Anglo-Indians were enjoying some special privileges in services in railways, customs, posts and telegraph. It was thought necessary that these concessions be continued for some time more and be withdrawn gradually. Accordingly, Art. 336(1) provided that for two years after the Constitution came into force, appointment of Anglo-Indians to these posts would continue on the same basis as it was before August 14, 1947. Thereafter, there was to be a progressive diminution in the number of posts reserved for them in these services at the rate of 10 per cent every two years. All such reservations came to an end by the 25th January, 1960. However, under Art. 336(2), this reservation was not to bar the appointment of qualified Anglo-Indians on merit to other posts. Further, before Independence, Anglo-Indian educational institutions were getting special grants. Art. 337 protected these grants for the first three years after the beginning of the Constitution. Thereafter, during each succeeding year, these grants could be reduced by ten per cent as compared to the grants in the preceding three years so that ten years after the commencement of the Constitution, such grants, to the extent to which they were a special concession to the Anglo-Indian community, were to cease. Thus, Art. 337 has now exhausted itself.92 E. OTHER BACKWARD CLASSES Page 243 Besides the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, there are Other Backward Classes. The Constitution extends some protection to the 'Other Backward Classes [OBCs]' as well as these classes have been neglected for long. The Other Backward Classes are to be found amongst all religious groups--Hindus, Muslims, Christians, etc. Under Art. 15(4), the State is empowered to make any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward class besides the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.1 The expression 'special provision, for advancement' has a wide connotation. It may include many things, such as, reservation of seats in educational institutions, financial assistance, scholarships, free housing and so on. Article 15 (5) now enables the State to enact a law relating to the admission of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes or socially and educationally backward classes of citizens in educational institutions other than the minority educational institutions referred to in Art.30(1).2 The Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2007 provides for reservation of seats in Central Educational Institutions inter alia for the Other Backward Classes. 'Other Backward Classes' has been defined as \"the class or classes of citizens who are socially and educationally backward, and are so determined by the Central Government\". Presumably having regard to Art. 335, specified institutions of excellence, research institutions and institutions of national and strategic importance have been kept outside the scope of the Act. Under Art. 16(4), the state can make provisions for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of \"any backward class of citizens\".3 While there exist in the Constitution special provisions for reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the Lok Sabha and the State Legislative Assemblies [ Arts. 330 and 332], and for the representation of the Anglo-Indian Community in these various Houses, there exists no such provision for reservation of seats for socially and educationally Backward Classes in the Lok Sabha and the State Legislative Assemblies.

    "content": "and 332], and for the representation of the Anglo-Indian Community in these various Houses, there exists no such provision for reservation of seats for socially and educationally Backward Classes in the Lok Sabha and the State Legislative Assemblies. Again, while under Art. 335, there is a constitutional obligation to consider the claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the making of appointments to services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Centre and the States, there exists no corresponding provision for the Other Backward Classes. However, under Art. 16(4), it is permissible to reserve posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which, in the opinion of the concerned Government, is not adequately represented in the services of the State or the Central Government.4 It has been ruled by the Supreme Court that Art. 16(4) must be read along with Art. 335. Though on the express terms of Art. 335, the OBCs are not included therein, even the OBCs are also covered by the thrust of Art. 335.5 This means that when the State proposes to provide reservation for OBCs, \"if it is considered by the appropriate authority that such reservation will adversely affect the efficiency of the administration, then exercise under Art. 16(4) is not permissible\". This is the constitutional limitation on the exercise of the enabling power of reservation under Art. 16(4). Further, if reservation is to be provided by passing a law by the State Legislature in the subordinate judiciary covered by Arts. 233 and 234,6 \"then the efficiency of the judicial administration will be affected is a matter within the exclusive purview of the High Court which shall have to be consulted\". Such consultation is a constitutional obligation before any Act/Rules are made for the purpose.7 Accordingly, a Bihar Act making reservation in appointment of district and subordinate judge for OBCs was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Courtas the High Court had not been consulted before passing the Act.8 A very difficult problem of the day is to identify Other Backward Classes. Generally, socially and educationally backward persons fall within the category of Backward Classes, but even after 50 years of enforcement of the Constitution, it has not been possible to evolve acceptable criteria for the purpose of identifying the OBCs. It is necessary to state here that the expression \"weaker sections\" of the people used in Art. 46 is somewhat different from the expression \"backward class\" of citizens used in Art. 16(4) which is only a part of the weaker sections.9 The expression \"weaker sections\" of the people is wider than the expression \"backward class\" of citizens which is only a part of the \"weaker sections\". The expression \"weaker sections\" connotes all sections of society who are rendered weaker due to various Page 244 causes. Art. 46 is aimed at promoting their educational and economic interests and protecting them from social injustice and exploitation. This obligation cast on the state is consistent both with the Preamble as well as Art. 38.10 The term 'backward class\" denotes a class which is socially backward and whose educational and economic backwardness is because of its social backwardness. Thus, the expression \"backward class\" in Art. 16 does not comprise all weaker sections of people but only those which are socially and, therefore, educationally and economically backward. The Other Backward Classes have not been specified in the Constitution for, at the time of the Constitution-making, not much information was available about them. The Constitution in its various provisions does not even use a single uniform expression, but uses various expressions, to characterise Backward Classes. In Arts. 15(4), 15(5) and 340, the expression used is 'socially and educationally backward classes. In Art. 16(4), the expression used is 'backward' simpliciter; in Art. 46, the term used is 'weaker sections of the people'.11 One of the main criteria for determining socially and educationally backward classes is poverty. Therefore the principle of exclusion of \"creamy layer\" is necessary.12 A person belonging to OBC in one State cannot automatically claim the same status in another State. Each State has its own list of OBCs. The Supreme Court has explained the rationale underlying this rule as follows:13 \"Castes or groups are specified in relation to a given State or Union Territory, which obviously means that such caste would include caste belonging to an OBC group in relation to that State or Union Territory for which it is specified. The matters that are to be taken into consideration for specifying a particular caste in a particular group belonging to OBCs would depend on the nature and extent of disadvantages and social handicaps suffered by that caste or group in that State. However, it may not be so in another State to which a person belongs thereto goes by migration....\" Thus, a person belonging to OBC on migration from the State of his origin in another state where his caste is not in the OBC list was entitled to the benefits or concessions admissible to the OBCs in his State of origin and Union Government, but not in the State to which he has migrated. In Valsamma,14 the Court considered the following general question which is relevant to S/Cs, S/Ts and OBCs: \"Whether a lady marrying a S/C, S/T or OBC citizen or one transplanted by adoption or any other voluntary act, ipso facto, becomes entitled to claim reservation under Art. 15(4) or 16(4), as the case may be?\" The Court has answered the question in the negative. The Court has argued that S/Cs, S/Ts and OBCs have suffered social disabilities for long and so they have become \"socially, culturally and educationally backward\". The object of reservation is to remove these handicaps and to bring them in the mainstream of national life.",

The Court has argued that S/Cs, S/Ts and OBCs have suffered social disabilities for long and so they have become \"socially, culturally and educationally backward\". The object of reservation is to remove these handicaps and to bring them in the mainstream of national life. A person belonging to a forward class has an advantageous start in life; when he or she is transplanted in the backward class by adoption or marriage or conversion, he cannot claim the benefits of reservation either under Art. 15(4) or 16(4), as the case may be. \"Acquisition of the status of a S/C etc. by voluntary mobility into these categories would play fraud on the Constitution and would frustrate the benign constitutional policy under Articles 15(4) and 16(4) of the Constitution\". (a) BACKWARD CLASSES COMMISSION To facilitate the task of identifying the backward classes and laying down criteria for the purpose, Art. 340(1) empowers the President to appoint a Commission consisting of such persons as he thinks fit to investigate the conditions of \"socially and educationally backward classes\" in India and the difficulties under which they labour. The Commission may recommend the steps that should be taken by the Central and State Governments to remove their difficulties and improve their condition. The Commission may also make recommendations as to the grants which should be made for the purpose by the Centre or any State, and the conditions subject to which such grants should be made. The Presidential Order appointing the Commission is to define the Page 245 procedure to be followed by the Commission. The Commission is to investigate the matters referred to it and present its report to the President setting out the facts as found by it and making its recommendations [ Art. 340(2)]. The report of the Commission together with a memorandum setting out the action taken thereon by the Central Government is to be laid before each House of Parliament [ Art. 340(3)]. (b) FIRST BACKWARD CLASSES COMMISSION As envisaged by the Constitution, the Backward Classes Commission was appointed by the President in January, 1953, under the Chairmanship of Kaka Kalelkar. The Commission was asked, among other things, to determine the criteria to be adopted for classifying socially and educationally backward classes. The Commission submitted its report in 1955. The report was not unanimous and disclosed a considerable divergence of opinion among its members and failed to specify any easily discernible objective tests to define \"backwardness\". The majority of the members of the Commission expressed the view that the position of the individual in the social hierarchy based on caste should determine backwardness. The Central Government could not accept such a criterion because \"the caste system is the greatest hindrance in the way of our progress towards an egalitarian society, and the recognition of the specified castes as backward may serve to maintain and even perpetuate the existing distinctions on the basis of caste.\" Besides, while some members in some castes may be characterised as backward \"educationally and economically,\" some may not be so classified. Similarly, among the so-called upper and advanced classes, there are large number of persons who are not less backward educationally and economically, and even among the backward classes some castes are more backward than others. Then, conditions differ from State to State and region to region. The Commission also suggested certain other criteria to identify backwardness, e.g., lack of general educational advancement among the major sections of a caste or community, inadequate representation in the field of trade, commerce and industry, communities consisting of a large percentage of small landowners with uneconomic holdings, etc. The Government's reaction to this was that \"these are obviously vague tests, more or less of an individual character, and even if they are accepted they would encompass a large majority of the country's population.\" And, if the entire community, barring a few exceptions, were thus to be regarded as backward, the really needy would be swamped by the multitude and hardly receive attention or adequate assistance, nor would such a dispensation fulfil the conditions laid down in Art. 340 of the Constitution. The Government of India thus came to the conclusion that further investigation was necessary with a view to devise some positive and workable criteria to specify the socially and educationally backward classes so as to give them adequate assistance and relief in all suitable ways so as to enable them to make up for the leeway of the past and to acquire the normal standards of life prevalent in the country on a systematic and elaborate basis. In the meantime, relief was to be provided to such groups of people to whom disabilities were attached by reasons of environment and occupations considered to be low, and to other classes who, adjudged in the light of reasonable standards, might well be regarded as socially and educationally backward.The task to devise positive and workable critieria to identify backwardness on an all-India basis thus remained incomplete. No indisputable yardstick could be evolved for the purpose. Each State defined backwardness in its own way, and political expediency played some role in this matter. There was thus no uniformity of approach in the country in this respect. For purposes of Arts. 15(4)15,(5) and 16(4)16, it is for the State concerned to list the Backward Classes. The Centre can also list them for purposes of admission into Central educational institutions and Central Services. Even this the Centre was not able to do. The task is an extremely difficult one. Many communities desire to be characterised as backward because of the facilities of admissions and services which are available to such classes, and they thus bring political influence to bear upon the government for being recognised as 'backward'.",

    "content": "this the Centre was not able to do. The task is an extremely difficult one. Many communities desire to be characterised as backward because of the facilities of admissions and services which are available to such classes, and they thus bring political influence to bear upon the government for being recognised as 'backward'. When a class is designated as backward, then even rich and well educated Page 246 members of the class claim the privileges available; the more unfortunate members of the class thus get excluded. This is against the best interests of the really backward persons. This frustrates the basic objective of the Constitution, viz., amelioration of the really and factually weak and downtrodden people. A bulk of case-law has arisen on this point. The courts have been able to instil some rationality in this regard by insisting that for purposes of Arts. 15(4),(5) and 16(4), caste cannot be the sole determinant of backwardness and that other tests like economic, professional, environmental, educational should also be taken into consideration. The practice to name the castes as 'Backward Classes', without any economic considerations, has two main defects. One, it has a tendency to perpetuate the caste system and, thus, hamper the growth of an egalitarian society. To accept caste as the basis of backwardness, it will lead to legitimisation and perpetuation of the caste system in the country which goes against the secular character of the Indian polity.17 Also, the traditional caste system is breaking down and is gradually being replaced by contractual relations between individuals. The future Indian society has undoubtedly to be classless and casteless. It is also not true to assume that all members of a caste are equally socially and educationally backward. Within a backward caste, if no economic considerations are applied, then all the privileges may be utilised by well to do people leaving the poor in the cold. It is, therefore, imperative that the castes as such should not be recognised for purposes of giving assistance. Instead, economic backwardness of classes of people should be the criteria for the purpose. These considerations have had an impact on the judicial approach concerning characterisation of backward classes so much so that caste cannot be taken as the sole criterion for the purpose and increasing emphasis is being laid on economic factors.18 Reference may be made here to a few of these judicial pronouncements. In Balaji,19 the Supreme Court ruled with reference to Art. 15(4), that it may not be irrelevant to take into account 'caste' to determine social backwardness. But it should not be made the \"sole dominant test\" for the purpose without regard to other relevant factors. It was observed in the instant case that \"social backwardness is on the ultimate analysis the result of poverty to a very large extent\". The Court also emphasized that for purposes of Art. 15(4), the backwardness must be social and educational and not either social or educational. In Rajendran,20 the Court accepted classification of backward classes based on 'caste' because the social and educational backwardness of the castes was based on their occupations. In P. Sagar,21 caste-wise classification was rejected because no other factor except caste was taken into consideration: The Court maintained that in determining whether a particular section forms a class, caste could not be excluded altogether. But in case the caste was made a criterion, proper inquiry or investigation should be conducted by the State Government before listing certain castes as socially and educationally backward. In K.S. Jayasree v. State of Kerala, 22 the Supreme Court upheld a government order listing backward classes but exempting therefrom such families as had an aggregate annual income of Rs. 10,000. The order was challenged by a candidate belonging to the backward class but who was denied the privilege of preferential admission to a medical college because her family income exceeded Rs. 10,000 annually. The Court emphasized that poverty or economic standard is a relevant factor in determining backwardness. Neither caste nor poverty alone could be the sole or dominant test, but both are relevant, to determine backwardness. With the improvement in economic position of a family, social backwardness disappears. To permit these persons to take advantage of the privileges meant for backward persons, is to deprive the real backward poor persons of their chance to make progress. The question has been elaborately considered by the Supreme Court in Indra Sawhney I.23 For example, Pandian, J., has stated that before a conclusion is drawn that a caste is backward, \"the existence of circumstances relevant to the formation of opinions is a sine qua non. If the opinion suffers from the vice of Page 247 non-application of mind or formulation of collateral grounds or beyond the scope of statute, or irrelevant and extraneous material, then that opinion is challengeable.\" Similarly, Jeevan Reddy, J., has emphasized that opinion in regard to backwardness must be based on relevant material. He went on to observe that under Art. 16(4), reservation is not being made in favour of a 'caste' but a backward class. \"Once a caste satisfies the criteria of backwardness, it becomes a backward class for the purposes of Art. 16(4)\". Jeevan Reddy, J., further emphasized: \"Once backward, always backward is not acceptable.\" Therefore, if a caste ceases to be backward in course of time, it should be excluded from the list of Backward Classes. The Supreme Court has observed in Indra Sawhney II:24 \"Caste only cannot be the basis for reservation. Reservation can be for a backward class of citizen of a particular caste. Therefore, from that, the creamy layer and the non-backward class of citizens are to be excluded.\" Recently Parliament enacted the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2006 providing 27 per cent quota to OBCs in institutions for higher education without identifying who could be considered to be an OBC.",

    "content": "Supreme Court in Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India clarified that if the determination of \"Other Backward Classes\" by the Central Government is with reference to a caste, it shall exclude the \"creamy layer\" among such caste.25 (c) SECOND BACKWARD CLASSES COMMISSION The Government of India again appointed the Backward Classes Commission (known as the Mandal Commission after its Chairman B.P. Mandal) under Art. 340 on January 1, 1979, with a view to investigate the conditions of the socially and educationally backward classes within the territory of India. The terms of reference of the Commission were as follows : (i) to determine the criteria for defining the socially and educationally Backward Classes; (ii) to recommend steps to be taken for the advancement of the socially and educationally backward classes of citizens so identified; (iii) to examine the desirability or otherwise of making provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in Central and State Governments in favour of Backward Classes. (iv) to make such recommendations as the Commission thinks proper. The Commission submitted its report on 31st December, 1980. The Commission was inter alia \"entrusted with the task of determining the criteria for defining the socially and educationally backward classes in the country.\" To determine social and educational backwardness, the Commission evolved eleven indicators or criteria, grouped under three broad heads--social, educational and economic. The Commission looked at the whole question of reservation of quotas for backward classes in recruitment for government services.26 The Commission held that (besides the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes who amount to 22.56% of the total population), 52% of the total Indian population could be characterised as backward and, therefore, 52% of all posts could be reserved for them. The Commission, however, refrained from making such a drastic recommendation in view of the Supreme Court's ruling that the total quantum of reservations under Art. 16(4) should be below 50%.27 In view of this legal constraint, the Commission was obliged to recommend reservation of 27% only for the Other Backward Classes so that the total reservation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and the Other Backward Classes would amount to a little less than 50%. The Commission by and large identified castes with backward classes and more or less entirely ignored the economic tests.28 The Commission also ignored the fact that even among the so-called higher castes, there may be a number of socially and educationally backward people deserving of help. On the whole, the Commission's recommendations have proved to be very controversial. Subsequent to the Report of the Backward Commission, the question of characterising backward classes again cropped up before the Supreme Court. In Vasanth Kumar.29 The Judges of the Supreme Court expressed a diversity of views in this regard. The only point on which all the Judges were agreed was that 'caste' cannot be the sole determinant of backwardness, but that it is not an irrelevant test and can be taken Page 248 into account along with other factors. Some of the Judges were in favour of adopting the means-cum-caste test to determine backwardness. Then, in 1993, in the famous Indra Sawhney case, a nine Judge Bench of the Supreme Court considered in depth the question of backwardness and reservation of posts under Art. 16(4). The highlights of this case have already been taken note of.30 More recently a Constitution Bench considered the same issue of backwardness and reservation in connection with educational institutions where, as noted earlier, the Court held that there can be no definite determination of the number of Other Backward Classes without including economically backward classes31. F. LINGUISTIC MINORITIES At the time of the framing of the Constitution, practically every State was multi-lingual. Therefore, the problem of linguistic minorities loomed large on the horizon as there were linguistic minorities in practically every State. It therefore became incumbent to make provisions to safeguard some of their rights. Accordingly, a few provisions were incorporated in the Constitution to cope with the problems of linguistic minorities. For example, there is the provision in Art. 14 barring discrimination.32 Arts. 15(1) and 15(2), noted earlier, do not specifically out-law discrimination on the ground of 'language'.33 Neither do Arts. 15(4) and 16(4) make any special provisions for linguistee minorities, or provide for reservation in services on the basis of language.34 Arts. 29 and 30 do confer rights on these minorities to conserve their culture and language.35 As has already been pointed out,36 under Art. 345, a State can prescribe a language for carrying on its official work. However, to protect the interests of a linguistic minority in a State,37 and to give it a sense of participation in State administration, Art. 347 lays down that, on a demand being made in that behalf, the President may, if he is satisfied that a substantial proportion of the population of a State desires the use of any language spoken by them to be recognised by that State, direct that such language shall also be officially recognized throughout that State, or any part thereof, for such purposes as he may specify.38 The onus to have a language recognised by the President in a State is thus placed on the people concerned. Another constitutional provision to safeguard the interests of the linguistic minorities is Art. 350. It makes an interesting provision that every person is entitled to submit a representation for redress of any grievance to any officer or authority of the Union or a State in any of the languages used in the Union or in the State as the case may be.39 The States Re-organisation Commission submitting its report in 1956 recommended that the Central Government should adopt, in consultation with the States, a clear code to govern the use of different languages at different levels of the State Administration and that effective steps be taken to see that this code is followed.",

    "content": "the wake of the re-organisation of the States on a linguistic basis in 1956, a number of unilingual States were formed.40 But this did not solve the problem of linguistic minorities. Even though new States were formed more or less on linguistic basis, each of these States also came to have linguistic minorities as well. Thus, the reorganisation of the States threw up in an acute form the difficult problem of linguistic minorities in practically every State, because while there was one dominant language group, in a State, several small language groups with languages different from the dominant language also came into being. A linguistic minority is a group of people having mother-tongue different from that of the majority in a State or a part thereof. The Constitution-makers had anticipated some such problem and had, accordingly, made provisions to meet the situation in Arts. 29,41 30,42 347 and 350, as noted above. But the dimensions of the problem as it emerged after 1956 were much bigger than what the Constitution-makers had envisaged or what the existing Constitutional provisions could adequately cope with. Consequently, two more Articles, 350A and 350B, were added to the Constitution specifically with a view to protect the interests of the linguistic minorities. There are three basic problems which a linguistic minority group faces in a State. First, the claim of the linguistic groups that education be imparted to their children in their own mother-tongues. Two, there is the Page 249 problem of use of minority languages in the administration. Three, there is the problem of representation of the linguistec minorities in the State services. (a) ART. 350A As regards the problem of education in a minority language, Arts. 29 and 30 as noted earlier, do make some provisions for this purpose. The purpose of Art. 29 is to facilitate inter-State migration of people. If, for example, a few people from Madras were to come and settle down in Bombay, they would constitute a cultural, as well as a linguistic, minority group in Maharashtra, and Art. 29 would protect their culture, language and script in Maharashtra. Article 29 does not impose any positive obligation on the State to take any action to conserve any culture or language. It merely enables a cultural or linguistic minority to preserve its own culture or language, and bars the State from imposing on it any other language or culture. Similarly, Art. 30 concedes to the minority the right to establish and administer its own educational institutions. It does not impose any positive obligation on a State to provide facilities for education in a minority language. The States Re-organisation Commission felt that these provisions were not adequate to meet the newly emerging situation after the linguistic re-organisation of the States. The linguistic minorities may not have the resources required to establish and maintain their own educational institutions. The language of instruction in educational institutions touches, in practice, many vital aspects of an individual's life and constitutes, in fact, the core of the problem of linguistic minorities. The Commission, therefore, suggested that the Constitution be amended so as to cast a positive obligation on the States to provide for facilities at the primary stage for education to the children of such minorities in their mother-tongue and, further, to empower the Central Government to issue appropriate directives for enforcing this obligation on the States.43 Accordingly, Art. 350A was added to the Constitution. Art 350A supplements Art. 29 as it directs every State, and every local authority within a State, to endeavour to provide adequate facilities for instruction in the mother-tongue at the primary stage of education to the children of linguistic minorities. The Article also empowers the President to issue such directions to any State as he considers necessary or proper for securing the provision of these facilities. The Commission was of the opinion that the secondary education would have to be treated differently from the primary education. Accordingly, the Commission did not recommend recognition in the Constitution of the right to have instruction in the mother-tongue at the secondary stage. It however suggested that the Government of India should, in consultation with the State Governments, lay down a clear policy in this area and take more effective steps to implement it. No special provision has been made in the Constitution in regard to the medium of instruction at the University level. Reference may however be made in this connection to the Guru Nanak University case.44 The Supreme Court has ruled that while a university has a right to provide for the education of the majority in the regional medium, it cannot stifle the language and script of any section of the Indian population. It is does so, then the right of such citizens to conserve their language or script through educational institutions of their own is stifled. A university cannot impede the right of the minorities to conserve their language, script and culture. (b) GOVERNMENT SERVICES The States Re-organisation Commission also referred to the question of discrimination indulged in the matter of government services in some States against linguistic minorities by invoking residence qualification. The Commission pointed out that the States have confined entry to their services to permanent residents of the State, the term 'permanent residents' being defined in various ways. The Commission pointed out that the domicile tests in force in some States worked to the disadvantage of the minority groups. The Commission, therefore, suggested the passing of a law by Parliament under Art. 16(3) with a view to liberalise residence Page 250 requirements for services in the States. Accordingly, the Public Employment (Requirement of Residence) Act, 1957, abolishes all laws prescribing residence as a qualification for State services.45 (c) EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS One kind of discrimination still remains and this has even been upheld by the Supreme Court in Joshi,46viz., use of residence qualification for admission to the State-maintained educational institutions.",

A requirement that for admission to State medical colleges, an applicant should have studied for 10 years in the educational institutions in the State, has been upheld as not infringing Arts. 19(1)(d) and (e). These articles ensure residence and movement throughout India but not that every citizen should have all the advantages and privileges available to citizens domiciled or residing in a State. A State can accord some preferential treatment to citizens domiciled or residing therein provided that it is not hit by Art. 14.47 Recently the Supreme Court has laid down that so far as admissions to postgraduate courses such as MS, MD and the like are concerned, it would be imminently desirable not to provide for any reservation based on residence or institutional preference.48 G. APPARATUS TO SUPERVISE SAFEGUARDS In order to ensure that the safeguards provided to the various groups under the Constitution do not just remain mere paper safeguards but are implemented effectively, the Constitution-makers felt it necessary to set up a machinery to keep a continuous watch and vigilance over the working of these safeguards throughout the country, and also to bring to the notice of the government and the legislature concerned any defects existing in the protection of these various groups. (a) COMMISSIONER FOR SCHEDULED CASTES AND SCHEDULED TRIBES Article 338(1) provided for the appointment of a Commissioner for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. He was appointed by the President. His duty was to investigate all matters relating to the safeguards provided to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes under the Constitution and to report to the President upon the working of those safeguards to the President from time to time. These reports were to be laid before each House of Parliament. (Art. 338(2)) The Commissioner used to make annual reports. The Commissioner used to collect materials for these reports from his own personal observations, information received by him from various State Governments, Government of India and non-official agencies. The Commissioner used to receive a large number of complaints from individuals and non-official agencies relating to injustices against, and harassment of, the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. He investigated these complaints in order to ascertain facts.Although he was all the powers of a civil court for the purposes of such investigation, he was not in fact a court and was not empowered to issue orders like a civil court.49 His reports usually dealt with such matters as social disabilities, legislative measures adopted by the various governments for the advancement of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, representation of these communities in Parliament and State legislatures; administrative set up in the governments to look after the interests of these various classes; reservations made for them in government services; educational facilities granted to the students of these classes by the government; welfare schemes of the State Governments for improving the conditions of the Scheduled Castes, Backward Classes, Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Areas and grants-in-aid by the Central Government to the State governments for these schemes. The Commissioner in his reports also reviewed the working of the constitutional safeguards in relation to the Anglo-Indians, and the working of the non-official agencies engaged in the task of helping these communities, and made recommendations and suggestions for the amelioration of the condition of these various classes in his charge. In brief, the reports of the Commissioner contained valuable information and important source material not only on the working of the various safeguards--constitutional, statutory and administrative--for the Scheduled Page 251 Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other weaker and backward sections of the population, but also on sociological and economic conditions of these people in the various regions of the country. In addition to the obligations imposed on the Commissioner under the Constitution, he also came to discharge, by convention, certain other functions, such as, representation of the Union Government on the managing committees of the non-official agencies receiving grants from the Centre; examining accounts of these organisations; advising the Central Government regarding the schemes for development of the Scheduled and Tribal Areas,50 removal of untouchability and welfare of the Scheduled Tribes and other backward classes,51 submitted by the State Governments and non-official agencies for grants-in-aid. On the whole, the Commissioner was concerned with the amelioration and development of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, Tribal Areas and their administration, removal of untouchability, etc. To maintain a live contact with local conditions, a few Regional Assistant Commissioners functioned throughout the country to assist the Commissioner.52 In his report for the year 1957-58, the Commissioner made an extremely valuable suggestion. He stated that backwardness has a tendency to perpetuate itself and become a vested interest and that if the ultimate goal of having a classless and casteless society is to be attained, the lists of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes would have to be reduced from year to year and replaced in due course by a list based on criteria of income-cum-merit. This has not, however, happened so far. In fact, the list originally drawn in 1950 has become longer and longer since then. More and more communities constantly pressurize for inclusion in the list. Logically, with the rising tempo of development activities, one would have expected that some of these communities would by now be ready to be excluded from the list of Scheduled Castes, but, what one actually finds is a reverse process in operation, viz., that of enlargement of the lists as more and more communities want to enjoy the rights and privileges available to these classes.",

    "content": "Advisory Committee for the revision of the lists of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, appointed by the Central Government in 1965, suggested that the more advanced communities in the lists concerned be gradually descheduled and a deadline be fixed when these lists would totally be dispensed with in the interest of complete integration of the Indian population. But it is not expected that any such suggestion will be acted upon in the near future because this is an area where political expediency takes precedence over sagacious action. In 1968, Parliament appointed a Parliamentary Committee on the Welfare of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and, thus, another concrete step was taken towards strengthening the supervisory mechanism over the working of the safeguards for these people.53 The committee consists of 20 members elected from the Lok Sabha, and 10 members elected from the Rajya Sabha. It has been invested with powers to criticise, guide and control the Government of India in the matter of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. It considered the reports of the Commissioner of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The committee reports to both Houses of Parliament on the action to be taken by the Government for the welfare of these people. The committee also goes into the question of their employment in services under the Central Government including the public sector undertakings. The committee could thus go deeper into the major recommendations made by the Commissioner and could assess how far these recommendations had been implemented. Under Art. 338(3), the Commissioner of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes also discharged similar functions with respect to such other Backward Classes as the President, on receipt of the report of the Backward Classes Commission, specified by order. No such classes were ever specified.54 Further, the Commissioner was also required to discharge similar functions with regard to the Anglo-Indian community as he did with respect to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. (b) COMMISSIONER FOR LINGUISTIC MINORITIES To investigate all matters relating to the safeguards provided for the linguistic minorities under the Page 252 Constitution, and to report on these matters to the President at such interval as he may direct, Art. 350B, which was added to the Constitution on the suggestion of the States Re-organization Commission,55 provides for the appointment by the Central Government of the Commissioner for Linguistic Minorities.56 The Commissioner at present submits his report annually; these reports are laid before each House of Parliament where they are discussed, and are also sent to the concerned State Governments. The Commissioner plays a creative role in implementing safeguards to minorities and protecting their interests. However, his role is more of an investigative nature. He is not directly responsible for implementing, or overseeing the progress of implementation of, the safeguards for minorities. That is a weakness of the present system. In the XIIth report, the Commissioner for Linguistic Minorities suggested a review whether the implementing machinery of the safeguards at the State, district or any other level was adequate or not. It was also suggested by the Commissioner that there should be some central machinery to supervise the implementation of the safeguards.57 (c) ZONAL COUNCILS The Zonal Councils provide another institutional set-up to safeguard the interests of these minorities.58 The underlying idea is to enable the States in a zone to evolve a common policy regarding these minorities. The question of treatment of these minorities by the States may affect good neighbourliness amongst them. This can, to a large extent, be avoided by mutual discussions amongst them. The Zonal Council provides the forum for this purpose. (d) NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR SCHEDULED CASTES AND SCHEDULED TRIBES In course of time, it began to be felt that instead of a special officer (Commissioner of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes), a more effective arrangement for the purpose would be to have a high level multi-member Commission to guarantee constitutional safeguards for these people. Accordingly, Art. 338 was amended by the Constitution (65th Amendment) Act, 1990,59 so as to abolish the office of the Commissioner and to provide for the appointment of the National Commission for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes [ Art. 338(1)]. By a subsequent amendment60 the Commission was bifurcated into the National Commission for Scheduled Castes [ Art. 338] and the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes [ Art. 338A]. Each Commission is to consist of a Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson and three other members to be appointed by the President of India. Subject to any law made by Parliament, the conditions of service and tenure of office of these persons is to be determined by rules made by the President [ Art. 338(2) and Art. 338A(2)]. The Commissions investigate and monitor all matters relating to the safeguards provided for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes under the Constitution, or under any other law or under any order of the Government. The Commissions are also to evaluate the working of the safeguards. The Commissions are to inquire into specific complaints with respect to deprivation of any rights and safeguards to these people and to participate and advise on the planning process of socio-economic development of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes as the case may be and to evaluate the progress of their development under the Union and any State [ Art. 338(5)(a), (b), (c) and Art. 338A (5) (a),(b),(c)]. The Commissions are to make recommendations as to the measures to be taken by the various Governments for the effective implementation of these safeguards and other measures for the protection, welfare and socio-economic development of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes [ Art. 338(5)(e) and Art. 338A(5)(e)]. In addition, the Commissions are to discharge such other functions in relation to the protection, welfare and development and advancement of the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes as the President may, subject to any law made by Parliament, by rule specify [ Art. 338(5)(f) and Art. 338A(5) (f)].",

In addition, the Commissions are to discharge such other functions in relation to the protection, welfare and development and advancement of the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes as the President may, subject to any law made by Parliament, by rule specify [ Art. 338(5)(f) and Art. 338A(5) (f)]. Page 253 The Central and every State Government are required to consult the Commissions on all major policy matters affecting Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The Commissions have power to regulate their own procedure [ Art. 338(9) and Art. 338A(9)]. The Commissions are to make annual reports to the President. They can also make reports as and when it is necessary. These reports are to be placed before each House of Parliament along with a memorandum by the Government as to the action taken or proposed to be taken on the recommendations made by the Commissions. Any report of the Commissions pertaining to a State Government is to be forwarded to the State Governor and is to be placed before the State Legislature with a government memorandum explaining the action taken or proposed to be taken on these recommendations or the reasons, if any, for the non-acceptance of any of such recommendations [ Arts. 338(d), (6), (7), 338A (5)(d),(6), (7)]. The Commissions have been given power of a civil court trying a suit and, in particular, in respect of such matters as summoning and examination of witnesses, discovery and production of documents [ Arts. 338(8), 338(8)]. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Commission has no power to grant injunctions whether temporary or permanent.61 The Commissions have several State offices located in different States and Union Territories. These offices serve as the \"eyes and ears\" of the Commissions as these offices keep the Commissions informed of all important activities, decisions and orders of the State Governments concerning SCs and STs. The important constitutional safeguards for the SCs and STs are as follows : Article 46 refers to developmental and protective safeguards;62 Art. 17,63 Art. 23, Art. 24,64 Art. 25(2)(b)65 confer social safeguards; Art. 244,66 Art. 275(1),67 Fifth and Sixth Schedules confer economic safeguards, Art. 15(4),(5)68 Art. 29(1)69 and Art. 350A70 refer to educational and cultural safeguards. Political safeguards are conferred by Arts. 164(1),71 330, 332, 334,72 371A, 371B, 371C, 371F.73 Arts. 16(4), 16(4A), 335 and 320(4) confer service safeguards.74 Arts. 338(5)(c) and 338A(5)(c) of the Constitution refer to socio-economic development of the SCs/STs. This is a very important function of the Commissions, which have to keep track of all the major policy decisions, legislative or executive action by the Government of India or any State Government. The Commissions are required to inquire into specific complaints with respect to the deprivation of rights and safeguards of SCs and STs [ Arts. 338(5)(b) and 338A(5)(b)]. A number of statutes have been enacted to provide safeguards to SCs/STs. For example, to give effect to Art. 1775the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955, has been enacted. ThisAct makes the practice of untouchability as both congnizable and non-compoundable offence and provides for strict punishment for the offences committed under the Act. Under the Act, responsibility is cast on the State Governments to take such measures as may be necessary for ensuring that the rights arising from abolition of untouchability are made available to the persons subjected to any disability arising out of untouchability. There is also the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The Act specifies the atrocities which are made penal under the Act. The Commissions are concerned with devising ways and means to ensure effective implementation of these Acts. The Commissions collect monthly statistics concerning the offences committed under these Acts.76 The Commissions make suggestions to the State Governments for effectively dealing with the crimes committed under these Acts. The Commissions are concerned with the education of the children of SCs and STs and make recommendations for strengthening the infrastructure for the purpose.77 Another area of interest for the Commissions is economic development of the SCs and STs. For this purpose, the Commissions review the development programmes undertaken by the States for SCs and STs. Page 254 78 (e) NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR MINORITIES As a further step to safeguard the interests of the religious and linguistic minorities, to preserve the country's secular traditions, to promote national integration and remove any feeling of inequality and discrimination amongst these sections of the people, the Government of India appointed a Minorities' Commission in 1978 under an administrative resolution.79 The Commission was charged with the function of evaluating the various safeguards provided in the Constitution for the protection of the minorities and in the laws passed by Parliament and the State Legislatures. The Commission was to make recommendations with a view to ensuring effective implementation and enforcement of all the safeguards and the laws, undertake review of the implementation of the policies pursued by the Central and the State Governments with respect to the minorities and look into specific complaints regarding deprivation of rights and safeguards of the minorities. The Commission was to conduct studies, research and analysis on the question of avoidance of the discrimination against minorities, suggest appropriate legal and welfare measures in respect of any minority and serve as a national clearing house for information in respect of the conditions of the minorities. The Commission made periodical reports at prescribed intervals to the Central Government. The Commission submitted an annual report to the President detailing its activities and recommendations. This however did not preclude the Commission from submitting reports to the government at any time it considered necessary on the matters within its scope of its work. The annual report together with a memorandum outlining the action taken on the recommendations, and explaining the reasons for non-acceptance of recommendations, if any, in so far as it related to the Central Government was laid before each House of Parliament. The scope of the Commission's work extended to minorities whether based on religion or language.",

    "content": "annual report together with a memorandum outlining the action taken on the recommendations, and explaining the reasons for non-acceptance of recommendations, if any, in so far as it related to the Central Government was laid before each House of Parliament. The scope of the Commission's work extended to minorities whether based on religion or language. In course of time, the Commission suggested that its position be strengthened by conferring on it statutory powers of enquiry under the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952. The Commission also suggested that it be given a constitutional status so that it could function more effectively.80Accordingly, Parliament enacted the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992, to establish the National Commission For Minorities [NCM] on a statutory basis. An interesting feature of the Act is that it does not define the term 'Minority' but leaves it to the Central Government to notify minorities for the purposes of the Act [ s. 2(c)].81 The Commission consists of a Chairperson, a Vice-Chairperson and five members who are nominated by the Central Government from time to time from amongst persons of eminence, ability and integrity subject to the rider that five members including the chairperson must belong to the minority communities [ s. 3]. The Chairperson and every member holds office for three years from the date he assumes office [ s. 4]. Under s. 4(2), the Government has power to remove the Chairperson or any member on a few specified grounds, such as, insolvency, moral turpitude, unsoundness of mind, abuse of power, etc. The Central Government also appoints a Secretary to the Commission [ s. 5]. The Commission meets as and when necessary [ s. 8(1)], has power to regulate its own procedure [ s. 8(2)], and enjoys powers of a civil court for purposes of summoning witnesses, receiving evidence on affidavits etc. [ s. 9(4)]. The Commission discharges the following functions [ s. 9] : (a) evaluate the progress of the development of minorities under the Union and States; (b) monitor the working of the safeguards provided in the Constitution and in laws enacted by Parliament and the State Legislatures; (c) make recommendations for the effective implementation of safeguards for the protection of the interests of minorities by the Central government or the State Governments; (d) look into specific complaints regarding deprivation of rights and safeguards of the minorities Page 255 and take up such matters with the appropriate authorities; (e) cause studies to be undertaken into problems arising out of any discrimination against minorities and recommend measures for their removal; (f) conduct studies, research and analysis on the issues relating to socio-economic and educational development of minorities; (g) suggest appropriate measures in respect of any minority to be undertaken by the Central Government or the State Governments; (h) make periodical or special reports to the Central Government on any matter pertaining to minorities and in particular difficulties confronted by them; and (i) any other matter which may be referred to it by the Central Government. The Central Government is required to lay the recommendations made by the Commission under head (c) above before each House of Parliament along with a memorandum explaining the action taken or proposed to be taken on the recommendations relating to the Centre. If the Central Government does not accept any of these recommendations, it has to explain the reasons for non-acceptance [ s. 9(2)]. If any such recommendation concerns a State Government, the Commission forwards it to that government which follows the same procedure as mentioned above in s. 9(2). The Government lays the recommendation before the State legislature along with an explanatory memorandum [ s. 9(3)]. The Central Government makes grants to the Commission for being utilised by it for the purposes of this Act [ s. 10]. The salaries and allowances to the Chairperson and members and other staff are paid out of these grants. The Commission makes an annual report giving an account of its activities [ s. 12]. The Central Government lays the report before both Houses of Parliament along with an explanatory memorandum of action taken on the recommendations contained in the annual report and the reasons for the non-acceptance, if any, of such recommendations [ s. 12]. Reading ss. 3 and 9 of the Act together, the Supreme Court has observed in Misbah Alam Shaikh v. State of Maharashtra :82 \"....it is the duty of the Central Government to constitute: a National Commission and it shall be the duty and the responsibility of the National Commission to ensure compliance of the principles and programmes evaluated in section 9 of the Act protecting the interest of the minorities for their development and working of the safeguards provided to them in the Constitution and the law enacted by Parliament as well as the State Legislatures. The object thereby is to integrate them in the national main stream in the united and integrated Bharat providing facilities and opportunities to improve their economic and social status and empowerment.\" On the question of minorities, the following observation of Justice H.R. Khanna in St. Xavier's83 case may be quoted here : \"India is the most populous country of the world. The people inhabiting this vast land profess different religious and speak different languages. Despite the diversity of religion and language, there runs through the fabric of the Nation the golden thread of a basic innate unity. It is a mosaic of different religions, languages and cultures. Each of them has made a mark on Indian polity and India today represents a synthesis of them all. Our mission is to satisfy every interest and safeguard the interest of all the Minorities to their satisfaction. It is in the context of this background that we should view the provisions of the Constitution contained in Articles 25 to 30.",

It is in the context of this background that we should view the provisions of the Constitution contained in Articles 25 to 30. The object of Articles 25 to 30 was to preserve the rights of religious and linguistic minorities so as to place them on a secure pedestal and withdraw them from the vicissitudes of political controversy.\" Minorities Commissions have also been established in several States, e.g., Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka. After T.M.A.Pai84 decided that for the purpose of determining the minority the unit will be the state and not the whole of India, an interesting issue was raised before the Supreme Court in Bal Patil v. Union of India85. The Commission had recommended that Jains should be notified as a minority under section 2(c) of the Act. Page 256 The question before the court was whether it was for the State Government or the Centre to issue the relevant notification. The Court said that the power under Section 2(c) of the Act vests in the Central Government which alone, on its own assessment, has to accept or reject the claim of status of minority by a community. The recommendation of the Commission is only advisory and before the Central Government takes decision on claims of Jains as a \"minority\" under Section 2(c) of the Act, the identification has to be done on a State-wise basis. However the Court went on to observe that \"The power of the Central Government has to be exercised not merely on the advice and recommendation of the Commission but on consideration of the social, cultural and religious conditions of the Jain community in each State. Statistical data produced to show that a community is numerically a minority cannot be the sole criterion. If it is found that a majority of the members of the community belong to the affluent class of industrialists, businessmen, professionals and propertied class, it may not be necessary to notify them under the Act as such and extend any special treatment or protection to them as a minority.\"86 The court introduced a concept of the \"creamy layer\" which is alien to Art. 30 and in direct conflict with the decision in T.M.A.Pai which held that a minority had to be determined only on the basis of their numbers. More startlingly the Court said \"The Commission instead of encouraging claims from different communities for being added to the list of notified minorities under the Act should suggest ways and means to help to create social conditions where the list of notified minorities is gradually reduced and done away with altogether\"87. The mandate is contrary to the object of the Act which envisages that the Commission should be for the minorities and not for their elimination. (f) NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR BACKWARD CLASSES In the Indra Sawhney case,88 the Supreme Courthad directed that an expert body consisting of officials and non-officials be established at the level of the Centre and each State to look into the complaints of wrong inclusion or non-inclusion of groups, classes and sections in the lists of Backward Classes other than the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Accordingly, Parliament has enacted the National Commission for Backward Classes Act, 1993, to establish the National Commission for Backward Classes. The function of the Commission is to examine requests for inclusion of any class of citizens as a Backward Class in the lists and hear complaints of over-inclusion or under-inclusion ofany Backward Class in such lists and tender such advice to the Central Government as it deems appropriate [ s. 9(1)]. The advice of the Commission shall ordinarily be binding upon the Central Government [ s. 9(2)]. Lists of Backward Classes are prepared by the Central Government from time to time for purposes of making provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of the Backward Classes of citizens which, in the opinion of that Government, are not adequately represented in the services under that Government or any other authority under the control of that Government [ s. 2(c)]. The Central Government revises these lists from time to time. At the expiration of three years from the enforcement of this Act, and after every succeeding period of ten years thereafter, the Government is bound to undertake revision of the lists with a view to excluding therefrom those classes who have ceased to be Backward Classes, or for including in such lists new Backward Classes. While undertaking any such revision, the Central Government is to consult the Commission [ s. 11]. The Commission consists of the following members nominated by the Central Government: (a) a Chairperson, who is or has been a Supreme Court or a High Court Judge; (b) a social scientist; (c) two persons having special knowledge in matters relating to Backward Classes; and (d) a member-secretary, who is or has been an officer of the Central Government in the rank of a Secretary to the Government of India [ s. 3]. Page 257 Every member holds office for a term of three years from the date he assumes office [ s. 4]. The Commission meets as and when necessary and has power to regulate its own procedure [ s. 8]. While performing its functions, the Commission enjoys powers of a civil court trying a civil suit in respect of such matters as summoning witnesses etc. [ s. 10]. The Commission submits an annual report of its activities during the year to the Central Government [ s. 14]. The Central Government lays the report before both Houses of Parliament along with a memorandum of action taken on the advice tendered by the Commission and the reasons for the non-acceptance of any such advice [ s. 15]. Several States have set up State Commssions for Backward Classes after the decision in Indra Sawhney.",

Several States have set up State Commssions for Backward Classes after the decision in Indra Sawhney. Thus the Kerala State Commission for Backward Classes was constituted under the provisions of the Kerala State Commission for Backward Classes Act, 1993. Similarly The Karnataka Backward Classes Commission has been constituted under the Karnataka State Commission for Backward Classes Act, 1995 The Tamilnadu Backward Classes Commission has been constituted as a permanent body under Article 16(4) read with Article 340of the Constitution of India under a Government Order in 1993. H. WOMEN Women as a class neither belong to a minority group nor are they regarded as forming a Backward Class. India has traditionally been a male dominated society and, therefore, presently women suffer from many social and economic disabilities and handicaps. It thus becomes necessary that such conditions be created, and necessary ameliorative steps be taken, so that women as a class may make progress and are able to shed their disabilities as soon as possible. The Constitution does not contain many provisions specifically favouring women as such. There is Art. 15(3), reference to which has already been made earlier,89 which is a provision of permissive nature as it merely says that the state is not prevented from making any special provision for women. Then, there are such general provisions as Arts. 1490 and 15(2)91 which outlaw any kind of gender discrimination against women. Art. 21 is also there which can be used to spell out some safeguards for women.92 The Supreme Court has, in course of time, by its interpretative process of these various constitutional provisions extended some safeguards to women. Reference may be made to a few of these judicial pronouncements. Recognising that women in India need to be liberated from unjust social political and economic suppression, the Supreme Court has declared in Bodhisattwa93, that rape is a heinous crime against a woman and amounts to violation of the Fundamental Right guaranteed to a woman under Art. 21. The Court has gone further and recognised the right of a rape victim to claim compensation from the offender for violation of his constitutional right to live with human dignity which is guaranteed to her by Art. 21.94 The Court has reiterated this view in Chairman, Rly. Board v. Chandrima Das, 95 where a Bangladeshi woman was gang raped by a few railway employees at Sealdah Railway Station. The Court awarded compensation to her to the tune of Rs. 10 lakhs for violation of her rights under Art. 21. In Visakha,96 the Supreme Court has come down heavily on sexual harassment of women at work places and has declared the same to be violation of women's right under Art. 21. A law providing in favour of male succession to property in the male line was challenged on the premise that the provision was discriminatory and unfair against women and, therefore, ultra vires the equality clause in the Constitution. But the Court refused to do so as \"this would bring about a chaos in the existing state of law.\" The Court, however, did recognise the right to livelihood of the immediate female relatives of the last male holder to hold the land till they find an alternative source of livelihood for otherwise they would be rendered desti-tute.1Now by reason of an amendment in 2005 to the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 all female heirs have been conferred equal right in the matter of succession and inheritance with that of male heirs.2 Page 258 In Githa Hariharan,3 the Supreme Court has interpreted s. 6(a)of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956, as well ass. 19(b) of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, to mean that when the father is not in actual charge of the affairs of the minor either because of his indifference, or because of an agreement (oral or written) between him and the minor's mother, and the minor is in the exclusive care and custody of the mother, or the father for any other reason is unable to take care of the minor because of his physical and/or mental incapacity, the mother canact as the natural guardian of the minor and all her actions would be valid even during the life time of the father, who would be deemed to be 'absent' for the purpose of s. 6(a) of the HMG Act and s. 19(b) of the GW Act. A woman who is major has the right to go any where and live with anyone she likes without getting married. \"This may be regarded immoral by society but it is not illegal. There is a difference between law and morality.\"4 Reference may also be made to Sarla Mudgal and Lily Thomas discussed earlier.5 The Supreme Court has used the Directive Principles contained in Arts. 39(a), 39(d) and 39(e) to confer economic empowerment on women.6 NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR WOMEN To ameliorate the general social condition of the women in the country, Parliament has enacted the National Commission for Women Act, 1990, to establish the National Commission for Women (NCW). The Commission consists of the following : (a) a Chairperson, committed to the cause of women; (b) five members nominated from amongst persons having experience in law, trade unionism, management of an industry, administration, economic development, health, education, social welfare, women's voluntary organisations; (c) a member-secretary who is either a member of a civil service under the Centre, or an expert in the field of management, sociological movement [ s. 3]. All these persons hold office for three years and are appointed by the Central Government [ s. 4].",

    "content": "All these persons hold office for three years and are appointed by the Central Government [ s. 4]. The Commission has power to constitute committees as may be necessary to deal with special issues taken up by the Commission from time to time [ s. 8]. The Commission has power to regulate its own procedure [ s. 9] and has power of a civil court in matters like summoning witnesses [ s. 10(4)]. The Commission presents an annual report of its activities [ s. 13], which is presented to both Houses of Parliament along with a government memorandum of action taken thereon [ s. 14]. The terms of reference of the Commission as laid down in s. 10 of the Act are very comprehensive. The Commission discharges the following functions [ s. 10(1)] : (a) investigate and examine all matters relating to the safeguards provided for women under the Constitution and other laws; (b) present to the Central Government, annually and at such other times as the Commission may deem fit, reports upon the working of those safeguards; (c) make in such reports recommendations for the effective implementation of those safeguards for improving the conditions of women by the Union or any State; (d) review, from time to time, the existing provisions of the Constitution and other laws affecting women and recommend amendments thereto so as to suggest remedial legislative measures to meet any lacunae, inadequacies or shortcomings in such legislation; (e) take up the cases of violation of the provisions or the Constitution and of other laws relating to women with the appropriate authorities; (f) look into complaints and take suo motu notice of matters relating to-- (i) deprivation of women's rights; (ii) non-implementation of laws enacted to provide protection to women and also to achieve Page 259 the objective of equality and development; (iii) non-compliance of policy decisions, guidelines or instructions aimed at mitigating hardships and ensuring welfare and providing relief to women, and take up the issues arising out of such matters with appropriate authorities; (g) call for special studies or investigations into specific problems or situations arising out of discrimination and atrocities against women and identify the constraints so as to recommend strategies for their removal; (h) undertake promotional and educational research so as to suggest ways of ensuring due representation of women in all spheres and identify factors responsible for impeding their advancement, such as, lack of access to housing and basic services, inadequate support services and technologies for reducing drudgery and occupational health hazards and for increasing their productivity; (i) participate and advise on the planning process of socio economic development of women; (j) evaluate the progress of the development of women under the Union and any State; (k) inspect or cause to be inspected a jail, remand home, women's institution or other place of custody where women are kept as prisoners or otherwise, and take up with the concerned authorities for remedial action, if found necessary; (l) fund litigation involving issues affecting a large body of women; (m) make periodical reports to the Government on any matter pertaining to women and in particular various difficulties under which women toil; (n) any other matter which may be referred to it by the Central Government. The Central Government is required to lay before the two Houses of Parliament all the reports sent to it by the Commission under (b) above along with a memorandum explaining the action taken or proposed to be taken on the recommendations and the reasons for non-acceptance, if any, of any such recommendations [s. 10(2)]. If a recommendation relates to a State Government, the Commission sends the same to that government which lays the same before the State Legislature along with an explanatory memorandum [ s. 10(3)]. The Central Government makes grants to the Commission for being utilised for the purposes of the Act [ s. 11]. The salaries and allowances payable to the Chairperson and members of the Commission and its administrative expenses are to be paid out of the grants as mentioned above [ s. 6]. While investigating any matter referred to in (a), or sub-cl. (i) of cl. (f), the Commission enjoys all the powers of a civil court trying a suit, such as, summoning of witnesses, receiving evidence on affidavits etc. Section 16 of the Act makes it obligatory on the part of the Central Government to consult the Commission on all major policy matters affecting women. A reference to the annual report of the Commission for the year 1997-98 throws light on the functioning of the Commission. The Commission has undertaken review of all laws for the protection and empowerment of women. Out of 39 such laws, the Commission has reviewed the following ten laws during the year under review, viz., The Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987; The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971; The Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929; The Family Courts Act, 1984; the Foreign Marriage Act, 1969; The Guardian and Wards Act, 1869; The Indian Succession Act, 1925; The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955; The Indian Penal Code. The Commission has suggested suitable amendments in all these laws with a view to affording better protection to the women. In Chapter III of the Report, the Commission has reviewed cases of violence against women. The Commission has observed in this connection: \"Gender-based violence is recognised to-day as a major issue on national human rights agenda.\" The Commission views violence against women \"as one of the most crucial social mechanisms by which Page 260 women are forced into a subordinate position.\" In Ch. IV, the Commission has surveyed the problem of prostitution and has suggested strict implementation of s. section 13 of the Immoral Traffic Prevention Act which provides for appointment of special officers to fight traffickers. In Ch. V, the Commission has looked into the problems being faced by such groups of women as Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, mentally ill and handicapped women, widows, minorities.",

    "content": "13 of the Immoral Traffic Prevention Act which provides for appointment of special officers to fight traffickers. In Ch. V, the Commission has looked into the problems being faced by such groups of women as Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, mentally ill and handicapped women, widows, minorities. These groups need special attention because \"the problems of such women were peculiar to the socio-economic, cultural and situational factors affecting them.\" Other issues considered by the Commission in this report are : political participation by women (Ch. VI); women in custody (Ch. VIII); socio-economic development of women (Ch. VII). The Commission has defined its function as follows: \"The ultimate objective of the affairs of the Commission is to help enable the women to live a dignified life without distress and with undiscriminated socio-economic status in the society.\" More recently, in Seema v. Ashwani Kumar, the Commission submitted an affidavit in support of its opinion that non-registration of marriages affects women the most and a law making marriages compulsorily registrable would be of critical importance to various women-related issues such as: (a) Prevention of child marriages and to ensure minimum age of marriage. (b) Prevention of marriages without the consent of the parties. (c) Check illegal bigamy/polygamy. (d) Enabling married women to claim their right to live in the matrimonial house, maintenance, etc. (e) Enabling widows to claim their inheritance rights and other benefits and privileges which they are entitled to after the death of their husband. (f) Deterring men from deserting women after marriage. (g) Deterring parents/guardians from selling daughters/young girls to any person including a foreigner, under the garb of marriage. The Supreme Court7 accepted the views expressed by the Commission and directed the States and the Central Government to take the necessary steps to effect such a law. 1.

Thejudg. ment says th?L the essentialtesl5 to dctcnnine whether a particular inseitution is \"other authority\" within the meaning of anicle 12 are substantial financial aid, control by the Government, perform- ance of public functions and entrustment of governmental activities.

KhaliJ Mujib, 1981 SC 481 (Registeml Society). the Regional Engineering College was held to be a \"State\". P.N.

Notes on Article 14 Source: The source of article 14 lies in the American and the Irish Constitutions. h may be mentioned that the Preamble to the Indian Constitution speaks of equality of status and of opportun- ity and this article gives effect 10 that principle in the text of the Constitution. In a sense, the demand for equality is linked up with the history of the freedom movement in India. Indians wanted the same rights and previleges that their British masters enjoyed in India and the desire for civil rights was implicit in the fonnation of the Indian National Congress in 1885. The Commonwealth of India Bill. 1925, in clause 8 demanded, inter alia equality before the law and provided espeCially that there was to be \"no disqualification or disability on the ground only of sex\", along with the provi. sion that all persons were 10 have equal right to the use of \"roads, courts of justice and all other places of business or resort dedicated to the public\". See Chakravarty and Bhattacharya, Congress in Evolution, (1940), page 27.

The Karachi resolution (March 1931) reiterated. inreralia, this right in the resolution on fundamental rights and economic and social change. Chakravarty and Bhattacharya, Congress in Evolution.

Similarly, in the statutory framework of India. one does unfonunately come ocross provisions which introduce or maintain a cenain amount of inequality between Government officers and ordin· ary citizens. For example for a suit against the Governmentifr against a Government officer [or an act purponing to be done by the laner in his official capacity a two month notice is ordinarily requim.:l under section 80 oftbe Code of Civil Procedurc, 1908. Similarly. where a public servant who is not removable from his office except by or with sanction of the Government. is accused of an offence committed by him while acting or purponing to act in the discharge of his official duties, criminal couns are barred from talc.ing cognizance of such an offence without previous sanction of the Central Government or the State Governrncnt. (as tbe case may be) under section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Th~ tnt: In detennining the validity of such provisions, couns in India have followed the general principle that equal protection of the laws means the right to equal treatment in similar circumsla\"us, Couns have upheld legislation containing apparently discriminatory provisions where the discrimination is based on a reasonable basis. By 'reasonable', it is meant that the classification must not be arbitrary but must be rational. The classical test as judicially enunciated requires the fulfilment of two conditions, namely. (I) The classification must be founded on an intelligible differential which distinguishes those thai arc grouped together from others. (2) The differential must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achievod by the law under challenge.

Prohibilion of discrimination on grounds or \"liglon, race, caste, sex or place of birlh.--{ I) The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, SClI., placc of birth or any of them.

(3) Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any special provision for women and children. t[(4) Nothing in this article or in clause (2) of article 29 shall prevent the State from making any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educ3.tionally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.] Notes 00 Article 15 ReloJionship to Article /4 In a sense, the general and abstract principle of equality laid down in article 14 is spell out for certai~ situations in greater detail in article 15 and in some of the succeding articles. But it should be noted thai article 15 is limited to citizens, while article 14 extends to al1 persons. Secondly, article IS, clause (1) and anicle 15(2) are both limited to discrimination on the ground of religion, racC', sex, place of binh or any of them. Thirdly, the article permits the State to make special provisions for women and children. Fourthly, the article also permits the State to make any special provision for the fo!lowing :- (a) Socially and educationally backward classes of citizens; (h) Scheduled castes; and (e) Echeduled tribes. Article 14 prohibits the State from denying to any person equality before the law etc. Article 15(1) and article 16(2) project the citizen against discrimination; State of Siklcim v. Surandera Prasad Sh.:lrnUJ, JT (1994) 3 SC 372. Discrimination The cruct.al wow in this article is 'discrimination', which means 'making an adverse distincdon with regard to' or 'distinguishing unfavourably from others'; Ka/hi Raning Rawat v. Start! 0/ Saurashtra, (1952) SCR 435, 442. Another crucial word i~ 'only' 50 that jf the discrimination is based on some ground not connectl\"1 with rcligiGn ctc. but with some other rational factor, the discrimination would be valid. Women Clause (3), which permiu special provision for women and children, has been widely resorted to and the courts have upheld the validity of special measures in legislation or eXCUltive orders favouring women. In panicular, provisions in the criminal law, in favour of womcn, or in the proced!,~ law discriminiting in favour of women, have heen upheld.

This is on the basis lhallhe general right of equality guaranteed  by anicle 14, would override the special provision under article 15(4), in such circumstances. Hence, reservation of an excessively high percentage of scats in technical institutions for each classes would be void. In fact, ordinarily speaking, reservation in excess of 50 per cem of available seats may not be upheld. The undermentioned decisions may be seen on this point: (i) Stat~ oj A.P. v.

Apart form Schedule Castes and Schedules Tribes, the other ctasses eligible or reservation, if made by the Slate, is the category of \"socially and educationally backward classes of citizens\", In article 46, (a directive principle of State policy) it is the obligation of the state to promote with special care the educational nnd economic interests of \"the weaker sections of the people\", and in particular. \"of the Sheduled Castes 'and the Scheduled Tribes\" which is provided for. By article 335, it is provided that the claim of the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes shan be taken into considertltion consistently with the maintenance of efficiency in the adminiuration, in the making of appointments to services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of a State. 8U1 this article does not mention backward classes. Virtually, the Supreme Court has held the dement of efficiency of adminiu111lion as a limitation on articte 16(4). Incidentally, article 16(4) speaks of reservation of appointment of posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which, in the opinion of the State, is not adtquately represented in the service under the State.

However. the provision in clause (4) regarding backward class of citizens seems 10 possess n double character. As regards person not belonging 10 such class, the provision mlly appear to be a sanction for discrimination against them for special reasons. But as regards Ihe backward classes lhemselves, Ihey view il as a corrective 10 remedy the imbalance which has resulted from historical causes.

The decisions in support of this proposition are the following:- (i) Vrijfalv.Sultt!ojM.P\" AIR 1970SC 129.135. (ii) Sagi, Ahmad v. Swtt 0/ U.P., AIR 1954 SC 128. (iii) ChinlllmCUI Rao v. SUlre of M.P., (1950) SCR 759. Crittria of'tJ1idiJJ uj law The considetalions which generally prevail in judging the validity of a law in the context oflhis article are: (a) Whether the law imposes a restriction on the freedom in question; (b) Whether the restrictions have been imposed by law; (e) Whether the restrictions are reasonable; and (d) Whether Ihe restriction besides being reasonable, is imposed for one of the specified purposes relevanl 10 the freedom in question as enumerated in the applicable clause out of clauses (2) to (6) of the article. Each of these conditions must be satisfied. The tes' of nasolUlbkness In applying the test of reasonableness {which is the most crucial considetationl,lhe broad CritCf- ion is whdher the law ;>trikes a proper balance between social control on the one hand and the rights of the individual on the other hand. The court must takc into 3CCount the following aspects:- (a) nature of the right infringed: (b) underlying purpose of the restriction imposed: (e) evils soughllO be remedied by the law, its extent and urgency; (d) how far the restriction is or is not proportionate to the evil; and (d prevailing conditions at the lime.

Freedom of AnemblJ The freedom of assembly can be restricted for the purpose mentioned in article 19(3) by a reasonable law. Moreover, the freedom can be exercised only on public land. Restrictions imposed under article 19(3) would cover restrictions to maintain the sovereignily and integrity of India and public order. including the maintenance of traffic in the area concerned. But the restrictions cannot attain the SUtus of absolute prohibition at least in normal times. Ri,hJ to know A citizen has a right to know about the a.;:tivilies of the State. the instrumentalities. the departmcnt~ and the agencies of he State. The privilege of secrecy which existed in old times, (namely) that the Stilte is not bound to disclose the facts to the citizens or the State cannot be compelled by the citizens to disclose the facts, does not survive now to a great eltent.

Fr~~dom of MONmenl The freedom of movement guaranteed by clause (b) or article 19( I) is in addition 10 the right to personallibetty guaranteed under article 21. Orders of extc:rment and interment violate this right unless they fall within the pennissible rc:strictions. While judicial decisions confine this article to physical movement. the intangible aspect of freedom may receive protection under anicle 21. For example. domiciliary visits by the police at night disturbing a pen;on's sheep infringe pen;onal liberty under anicle 21 and may not be constitutionally valid, except in the case of surveillance needed (or the legitimate purpose of prevention of crime. In particular. entries in the 'Bad Character Register' at a police sration, if milia fid~. arc: subject 10 judicial scrutiny.

They policy must be laid down on which the discretion is to be elercised. Further, in general, the discretion must be exercised on relevant consideration. In short, if the law imposing licensing does not set OUI the: consideration. the law would be void. If lbe considerations are set OUI in the law, but are departed from by the: competentl authority while administering the: law then the order of the competent aulhorily would be void. even though the law itself may be valid.

Prolection in respect of conviclion for offences.--{ I) No person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at Ihe lime of the commis· \\ sion of the act charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been innicted under the law in force OIl the time of the commission of lhe offence. (2) No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once. (3) No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself. Noles on Article 20 Scope The prohibitions imposed by artide 20 are directly relevant to the criminal process. While clause (I) is concerned with the SUbslaOlive law of criminal liability and penalty, clauses (2) and (3) are concerned mainly with the stage of procedure. In the jurisprudence of oonstitutionallaw, ankle 20(1) incorporates a prohibition against 'ex POSI facto pt'na/ faw'. Article 20(2) incorporates a prohibition against 'double jeopardcy' article 20(3) gives protection against 'testimonial compulsion'. Because of the word 'person' used in each clause, the article must be regarded as applicable to a corponfion which is accused, prosecuted, convicted or punished for an offence; SiumnD v. Salish, (1954) SCR 1077. ThU5 article 20 is not confined to individuals aod common law offences. Vil'llatiDn oJ low and common low oJ/t'ncu Although clause (I) is mainly concerned with retroactive penal legislation, it also seems to give constitution recognition to the principle that there cannot be a conviction except for violalion of a 'law in force'. II would seem. therefore. that in India, then: can be no 'Common law' offences; and the judiciary cannot. in India. create an offence noc creatfd by statute. How far the wan! 'violation' would require that the violation should be personal, is a matter not specifically provided for in the anicle. The question must await judicial decisions at a later stage and anicle 21 may also be relevant. . No Ri,fht in Procedure It should be noted Ihal while substantive law imposing liability or penally cannot be altered to the prejudice of the person supposed to be guilty with retrospective effect, there is no vested right in procedure. Besides this, the thrust of article 20( I) is in the field of criminal law only, since the word 'offence' as defined in article 367 read with the General Clauses Act can only denote an act or omission punishable by law. Imponant decisions on the above aspect are the following :- (;) Shiv Bahadur v. State of U.P .. (1953) SCR 118. (;;) Kedar Nath v. SIDte ofW.B .. AIR 1953 SC 404. (iill lawala Ram v.

Double Jeopard] Article 20 As regards article 20(2) dealing with double jeopardy what it bars is 'prosecution and punishment after an earlier punishment for the same offence. 'Offence'here means an otTence as defined in section 3 (38) of the General Clauses Act applied 10 the Constitution by article 367. The offence must be the ~me.lhat is 10 say. involving the same ingredients in all respect and a trial for a separate and distinct offence is not barred under article 20(2). However. this article must be takcn as supplemented by section 26 of the General Gauses Act, 1897 and the provisions of the Code of Ciminal Procedure, 197) as to second prosecution after conviction or acquiUaI for an offence where the second persecution is excluded by the doctrine of au1r~fois convict or autufoic acquit. The word 'prosecution' would not normally cover depaiunental proceedings not held before a criminal court. The object of this provisions is to avoid the harassment which must be caused to a penon for successive criminal proceedings where only one crime has been committed. Important decisions interpreting this clause of article 20 arc the following :- (i) Makbool V. SUll~ (>f Bombay, (1953) SCR 730. (m Kalawati v. Sla/~ of H.P., (1953) SCR S46. (iiI) Stat~ of Bombay v.

There is no con,;tituJionai protection for witncses (i.e. penons oliler lIIan the accused). However, the Evidence Act, in sections 132 and 148, confen 8 limited protection against self· incrimination to witness in civil and criminal courts.

Protection of life and personalliberty.-No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law. Notes on Article 21 StOPI \\ Article 21, if read literally. is a colourless article and would be sati~fied, the moment it is established by me State that there is a law which provides a procedure which has been followed by the impugned action.But me expression 'procedure established by law' in article 21 has been judicially construed as meaning a procedure which is reasonable, fair and just. Read with article 39A. it would further imply legal aid bring made available to the indigent accused. and a prisoner. The concept of 'fairness', so evolved, has been imported into article 22(3) also, so mat a prison regulation which arbitrarily deprives a detenu of opportunity to interview his relatives or friends or II lawyer is invalid.

Freedom as to attendance at religious instrnction or religious worship in certain educational institUtiODS.-{ I) No religious instruction shall be provided in any. educational institution wholly maintained out of State funds. (2) Nothing in clause (1) shall apply to an educational institution which is administered by the State but has been established under any endowment or trust wruch requires that religious instruction shall be imparted in such institution. (3) No person attending any educational institution recognised by the State or recciv· ing aid out of State funds shall be required to take part in any religious instruction that may be imparted in such institution or to attend any religious worship that may be conducted in such institution or in any premises Bltached thereto unless such person or, ir such person is a minor, his guardian has given his consent thereto. Article 29 The COllSlilulion of India Cullural and Educalional Righls 29. Protection of interests of minor!ties.-(J }_Any section of the citizens residing in the territory of India or any part thereof having a distinct language. script or culture of its own shall have the right to conserve the same. (2) No citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the State or receiving aid out of State funds on grounds only of religion, race. caste, language or any of them. Noles 00 Article 29 The leading cases on article 29 are: (i) Kerala Education Bill In re. AIR 1958 SC 956. (ii) Ahmedabad St. Xaviers College Society v. Slnte ofGujarat, AIR 1974 SC 1389 . . (iii) State of Bombay v. Bombay Education Society, (1955) I SCR 568 : AIR 1954 SC 561. (iv) GujaraJ University v. Shri Krishtul, AIR 1963 SC 703. (v) D.A. V. Colkge Bhalindo v. Slate of Punjab, AIR 1971 SC 1731. Although, commonly article 29( I) is assumed to relate to minorities, its scope is not necessarily 50 confined, as it is available to \"any section of citizens resident in the territory of India\". This may well include the majority, as Ray, CJ. pointed out in the Ahmedabad SI. Xaviers Colkge Society v. State ofGujarat, AIR 1974 SC 1389. As regards article 29(2), it should be read subject to article 15(4), (as inserted in 1951), penniu- ing special provision for backward classes, thus overriding the earlier decision in State of Madras v. Champa~ Doraimjan, (1951) ~ 525. See B.S.H.K.P. v. Union of India, (1985) 2 sec 644. An important consequence of the 'right to conserve' one's script is that citizens have the right to agitale for the protection of their language. 'Political' religion for the conservation of the langu- age of a section of the citizens cannot, therefore, be regarded as a conupt practice within the mean- ing of section 123(3) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. s.tah, C.J. in.Jagdev Singh Sidhanti v.

MinDritUs Although the word 'Minorities' occurs in the Rlarginal oote to article 29, it does not occur in the text. The original proposal or the Advisory Committee in the Constituent Assembly recommendocl the following : \"(I)-Minoriliu in every wtit shall be protected in respect of lheir language, script and culture and no law; or regulations may beenacted that may opernte oppressively or prejudicially in this respccL\" [B. Shiva Ran, \"Select Documents\" (1957) Vol. 2, page 281.) But after the clause was considem:i by the Drafting Committee on 1st November: 1947, it emerged with the substitute of 'section of citizens'. (B. Shiva Roo, Select Documents (1957). Vol. 3 pages, 52.5-26. Clauses 23, Draft Constitution]. It was explained that the intention had always been to use 'minority' in a wide sense, so as to inCiude (for example) Maharashtrians who settled in Bengal. (7 C.A.D. pages 922-23). 52 Th~ Constitution of India Article 30 30. Right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions.-{ I) All minorities, whether based on religion or language. shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. 1[(lA) In making any law providing for the compulsory acquisition of any property of an educational institution established and administered by a minority. referred to in clause (I), the State shall ensure that the amount fixed by or determined umfer such law for the acquisiti,on of such property is such as would nol restrict or abrogate the right guaranteed under thai clause.1 (2) The Slate shall not, in granting aid to educational institulions. discriminate against any educational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority, whether based on religion or language. Notes on Article 30 Scop~ Article 30 is confined to minorities-whether based on religion or Janguage-and unlike article 29(1), it cannut be availed of by any 'section of cnizens'. At the same time, article 30(1) is not confined to the conservation of language, script or cullurc-unlike article 29(1). It may be, that the right given by article 29(1) is fortified, as regards mioorities. by article 30(1). But the two rights are separate; R~v. FatMr Proost v. Stol~ of Bihar, AIR 1969 SC 465.

Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities has defined 'minority' (by an inclusive definition), as under; (I) The tecm 'minority' includes only those non· document groups in a population which possess and wish 10 preserve stable ethnic, religious oc linguistic traditions or characteristics marskedly different from those of the fest of the population; (ii) such minorities should properly include a number of person suffficicnt by themselves \\0 preserve such traditions or characteristics; and (iii) such minorities must be loyal to the State of which they are nationals. . Article 27 of the International Convenant on Civil and Political Rights does not derine the expression but gives the following right to them: \"In those States in which ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities exist, persons belonging to such minorities shall not be denied_the right. in community with the other members of the group, to enjoy their own euhure, to profess and pr:lt:tice I~ir own religion or to use their own language.\" Minorll~s ~~d on rdision or IDnguage Backward classes are not minorities within anicle 30. As K.M. Munshi [5 C.A.D. page 2271 pointed out, \"'The Harijans generally knwon as the Scheduled Castes. are neither a racial minority nor 11 linguistic minority ......

Article 31e. inserted by the 25th Amendment, 1971. protected laws giving effect to the Directive Principles in article 39{b) and 39(c) from unconstitutionality on the ground of contravention of articles 14, 19 and 31. By the 42nd Amendment, 1976, thlr protection was extended to legislation for implemcntion of any directive principle. But the Supreme Court in 1980 (by majority) held this extension of the protection to be unconstitutional on the ground that such an omnibus withdrawal of legislation from judicial review would undermine the basic structure of the Constitution. In 1983, the Supreme Court has declared the relevant observation in its 1980 judgment to be obiter. See the following cases:- (i) Minuva Mills v. U~ion of India, AIR 1986 SC 2030. (ii) Min~rva Mills v. Union of Indio, AIR 1980 SC 1789, paragraphs 30, 64, 70 and 80. (iii) Sojuv Cou Manufacruring Co. v. Sharal Coking Coal, AIR 1983 SC 239, paragraphs 13,14.

SlOle of Kuala, AIR 1973 SC 1461. It follows that the court can still consider whether a particular law purporting to implement any directive principal can question in constitutionality if it finds that the nexus between that law and the Directiye Principle relied on is illusory or colourable or whether it has 'directed and reasonable' nexus with the directive principle in article 39(b) or article 39{c); Shim Singhji v.

Notes on Article 32 Varitl]' of rigllb eommg up 1M en/oreemenl Right given by la,w or recognised by law can be analysed into the following categorics:- (a) fulldamental rights given by the Constitution; (b) constitutional rights not having the status of fundamental rights: (c) statutory rights: (d) righls nOwing from subordinate legislation; (e) righls based on case law; if) customary rights: (g) conlraCtual rights. Seope 0/ Article 32 Only fundamental rights falling within category (a) above can be enforced undere article 32. Cases illustrating this proposition about the scope of article 32 are the following:- (i) Hajj Esmail v. CO~Unl Officer, AIR 1967 SC 1244. (il) KJlriakose v. Slate of Keralll, AIR 1977 SC 1509. Court cannot detenmnc an issue not involving fundamental right; Indian Express Newspapen v. Union of India. (1986) I sec 633, paragraphs 200 and 207. Supreme Court and HiZh Court: ConcurrentjJlrisdiction (a) On the lext of article 32 and 266, where a fundamental nght is involved. a party should be free to approach cither of the two courts. And this, in fact, has been the cartier judicial approach; M.K. Gapalan v. Slate of M.P., (1955) I SCR 168, 174. In fact, sollie decisioos have pointed out thal since the remedy under smcle 32(1) is itself a fundamental right, the Supreme Coon is under duty to grant relief for violation of a substantive fundamental right. (i) Kochunni v. Slo.te of Madras, AIR 1959 SC 725, 729. (it) Tola Iron &: Suel Co. v. Sarl:ar, AIR 1961 SC 65. (iii) Bishan Dos v. Slate of Punjab, AIR 1%1 SC 1570. (iv) KIuJrak. Singh v. Stale o/~f.P., AIR 1963 SC 1295. Even still stronger are decisions holding article 32to be a basic feature of the Constitution which car.not be taken llway by even amending the Constitution; Fertiliser Corpor01ion 0/ India v. Union 0/ India, AIR 1981 SC 344, paragraph II. (b) Notwithstanding the above position. the Supreme Coun has, in certain decisions pronounced in 1987, staled thai when: rdiefthrough High Coun is available under anicle 226, the party should first approach the High Coon. (i) P.N. K/lnWlr'l. MlIIIiripol C01pOralion o/Delhi, (1987) 4 sec 609, 610, 61 I. (il) KQIIJlbhoi BrohmbluJtl v. Stak o/Gwjara1, AIR 1987 SC 1159. It is submitted with great respect that this view goes against the intendment of the Constitution and is contrary to earlier case law. Article 32 The Constitution o/India 59 Economic policy Judicial review is not concerned with economic poli:cy. The court does not substitute its judgment for that of the legislature or ils agents. as to matters within. the province of either. The court does not supplement the \"feel of the expert\" by its own views. When the legislature acts within the sphere of its authority and delegates power to an agent, it may empower the agent to make findings of fact which are conclusive, provided such findings satisfy the test of reasonable· ness. In all such cases. judicial inquiry is confined to the question whether the findings of fact are reMOnably based on evidence, and whether such findings are consistent with the laws of the land; Sitaram Sugar Co. LId v. Union o/Indio, AIR 1990 SC 1277, 1299, paragraph 86 (Judgment of Dr. Justice Thommen at page 1297, parugraph 52 and footnote 8, contains an exhaustive survey of case law as to arbitrary action. It covers several English, American and Commonwealth cases). Priu futltion Price fixation is not within the province of the court. Judicial review is exhausted when there is found to be a rational basis for the conclusions reached by the concerned authority. See the undennentioned decisions: (i) Union o/India v. Cynamide LId., AIR 1987 SC 1802, 1807: (1987) 2 scc 720, 736. (ii) Gupta Sugar Works v. State o/U.P., AIR 1987 SC 2353: (1987) Supp SCC 476, 481. (iii) Sitaram Sugar Co. LId. v.

Hence, unless the subslantive fundamental right itself has been excluded by a law mad under article 33. the right survives and consequentially the remedy of writ also survives.

Legislation to gin effect to the provisions of this Part.-Notwithstanding anything in this Conslilulion.- (a) Parliament shall have. and the Legislature of a Stale shall nol have. power to make laws- (i) with respect 10 any of the matters which under clause (3) of article 16, clause (3) of article 32. article 33 and article 34 may be provided for by law made by Parliament; and (ii) for prescribing punishment for those acts which are declared 10 be offences under Ihis Part.: and Parliament shall. as soon as may be after the commencement of this Constitution, make laws for prescribing punishment for the acts referred to in sub-clause (il); (b) any law in force immediately before the commencement of this Constitution in the IcrrilOty of India with respect to any of the matters referred to in sub-clause (i) of clause (a) or providing for punishment for any act referred 10 in sub-clause (ii) of that clause shall, subject to the tenns thereof and to any adaptations and modifications that may be made therein under article 372, continue in force until altered or repealed or amended by Parliament. Explanation.-In this article, the expression 'law in force' has the same meaning as in article 372. Notes on Article 3S The significance of article 35 is positive as well as negative. From the positive aspect. it gives power to Parliament to legislate ror the enumernted mailers-which legislation can conlain penal provisions. Negatively, it extends the competence of State legislatures to make a law on the enumerated matters. even though some of those matters may rail within the State List. PART IV DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICY 36. Definition..-In Ihis Part, unless the context otherwise requires. 'the Slate' has the same meaning as in Part Ill. 37. Application or the principles contained in this ParL-The provisions contained in Ihis Pari shall not be enforceable by any court, but the principles therein laid down are nevertheless fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duly of the State to apply these principles in making laws. Noles on Article 37 Scop~ and objn:l: The ftegatil't aspect The object of Directive principles is to embody the concept of a welfare Stale; Kt!SMVatUl\"OO Blwrali v. StllU of Keraln, (1973) 4 sec 225, paragraphs 134, 139. 174. However, the Directive do nol confer any enforceable rights and their alleged breach does nOI invalidate a law, nor does it entitle a citizen to complain of its violation by the state so as to seck rnandalory relief against the Stale. Similarly, if a legislative power docs not ellist in a particular legislalure, then the legislalure cannot seek to rely on a Directive principle for claiming that power. Undermentioned decisions support the above pr;)positions: (i) Kerow Edumlion Bill, In u, AIR 1958 SC 956. (ii) Deep CJumd v. Slole of V.P., AIR 1959 SC 648. (iii) Sfllle of Madnu v. C/wmptlkam Dorairajan, (1951) SC 525. (iv) From NaurwtUlji v. Slau 0/ Bombay, AIR 1951 Born 216. (v) UPSE Board v. Hari, AIR 1979 SC 65, paragrapb 4A. Scope and effect: The poritlve asped At the same time, the Directive principles have, according to later decisions of the Supreme Court. a positive aspect. Thus, the Directives have been held to supplement fundamental rights in achieving a Welfare State. Parliament can amend fundamental rights for implementing the Directives.. so long as the amendment does not touch the basic features. Legislation enacted to implement the Directive principles should be upheld, as far as possible. In (act. when necessary. even constitutional provisions as to fundamental rights should be adjusted in their ambit so as to give effect to the Directive principles. Even legislative ehtries may (within the limits of the total federal scheme) be given a wide interpretation for effecting Directive principles. Constitutional prOvisions (apart from fundamental rights) may be construed in the light of Directive principles. Undcrmcntioncd decisions iIIusttate the above propositions: (I) CJumdra Blravan v.
